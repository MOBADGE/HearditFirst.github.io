    <p>The fan-led remake of Team Fortress 2 Classic has been rebranded as Team Fortress 2 Classified and its release date pushed back to January 30, 2026. The developers cited the need for additional polish and noted with some humor that “it wouldn’t be an authentic TF2 experience without a bit of Valve time,” referencing Valve’s known delays. This project aims to preserve the feel of the original TF2 while updating aspects to improve gameplay. The delay means players will need to wait longer for this community-driven alternative, but it suggests the team is focusing on delivering a more refined experience.</p>
<p>Collectibles company iam8bit has filed a lawsuit against publisher Skybound, alleging fraud connected to the distribution of physical merchandise for the cat simulation game Stray. The dispute centers on unpaid debts and contract issues relating to special edition collectibles. iam8bit claims Skybound withheld payments while continuing to sell items. This case highlights ongoing challenges in partnerships between game publishers and third-party merchandisers, potentially affecting how collectible deals are structured and trusted in the future.</p>
<h2>Northgard Updated to Definitive Edition with Major DLC Included</h2>
<p>The Viking-themed real-time strategy game Northgard has received a major update, now labeled Northgard: Definitive Edition. This update integrates all previous major downloadable content into the base game and adds new features and improvements at no extra cost for current players. Alongside this, Northgard is discounted by 60% until December 18. This consolidation offers a more complete experience to new and returning players and may help the game maintain relevance in the crowded RTS market.</p>
<p>The mountain biking game Descenders Next has launched a significant multiplayer update after a lengthy wait. The development team apologized for the delays and stated they are working to recapture the original feel and flow of the Descenders franchise. The multiplayer addition aims to expand replayability and community engagement by allowing riders to compete and ride together online. This update addresses player expectations and could revitalize interest in Descenders Next.</p>
<h2>Conscript Survival Horror Receives Major Update</h2>
<p>Conscript, a World War I survival horror title, has been updated with a "huge" patch adding a hardcore mode, redesigned levels, new items, gear, and more gameplay tweaks. The developer described this as the version they would have preferred to launch initially if more testing time had been available. The update improves difficulty and immersion, potentially appealing to players looking for a tougher and more polished horror experience set during the Great War.</p>
<p>The creator behind the animated short The Backwater Gospel is developing a new first-person shooter inspired by Half-Life and narrative-driven shooters from the 1990s and early 2000s. This project aims to evoke the storytelling and gameplay style of that era, seen as a golden age for FPS games focused on immersive narratives. Though details remain limited, it represents a notable creative endeavor drawing on classic influences in the genre.</p>
