    <h1>A Little Birdy - Gaming News</h1>
    <div class="date">December 08, 2025</div>
    <p>The fan-made project formerly known as Team Fortress 2 Classic has been renamed Team Fortress 2 Classified and its release has been postponed until January 30, 2026. The developers attributed the delay partly to a desire to stay true to the original game's style, joking that "it wouldn't be an authentic TF2 experience without a bit of Valve time." The update aims to deliver a faithful recreation of the classic Team Fortress 2 experience with improvements and new content. This delay gives the team more time to refine the game and ensure stability at launch, which is important given the strong fan community that continues to play the original nearly two decades after its debut.</p>
<p>Collectible company iam8bit has filed a lawsuit against Skybound Entertainment, the publisher behind the cat-themed simulation game Stray, accusing them of fraud related to exclusive physical collectibles. The dispute centers on the production and distribution of limited-edition items tied to Stray, with iam8bit claiming Skybound failed to meet contractual obligations and misled them about certain arrangements. This legal conflict highlights potential risks in collaborative merchandising deals between game publishers and third-party vendors. Stray’s popularity has increased demand for memorabilia, making the outcome relevant to collectors and companies managing licensed products.</p>
<h2>Descenders Next receives major multiplayer update</h2>
<p>Descenders Next, the sequel to the downhill biking game Descenders, has launched a significant multiplayer update. The developers apologized for the delay in delivering this content and said they are working carefully to restore the fluid gameplay that fans expect from the series. The update introduces new multiplayer modes and improvements aimed at recapturing the feel and momentum of the original game’s cycling experience. This marks an important step in supporting the sequel’s player base and addresses community feedback after an extended period without major updates.</p>
<h2>World War I survival horror Conscript gets large update with hardcore mode</h2>
<p>The indie survival horror game Conscript, set during World War I, has received a large update that adds a new hardcore difficulty mode, redesigned levels, additional items, and gear improvements. The developer described this update as the version they would have liked to release initially, after having more time for testing and refinement. The changes focus on increasing challenge and immersion for players, enhancing the game’s tense atmosphere and survival mechanics. Given Conscript’s niche setting and gameplay, the update may attract players interested in both historical and horror games looking for a more demanding experience.</p>
<p>The Viking-themed real-time strategy game Northgard has been rebranded as Northgard: Definitive Edition following an update that consolidates all major downloadable content into the base game. Existing players receive the new content for free, and several additional features and balancing tweaks have been added. To coincide with this relaunch, Northgard is currently discounted by 60% in digital stores until December 18. This update simplifies the player experience by combining expansions and updates into a single package, potentially attracting new players and encouraging past owners to return for the enhanced version.</p>
