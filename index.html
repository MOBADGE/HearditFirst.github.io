<h2>International Diplomacy: US-Russia Peace Plan on Ukraine</h2>
<p>The United States has proposed a peace plan aimed at resolving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This plan was reportedly developed by US and Russian officials but notably without Ukraine's participation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to discuss the proposal with former US President Donald Trump, who appears to be involved in the dialogue. The absence of Ukraine in drafting the plan raises questions about its potential acceptance and effectiveness, as Kyiv remains a key stakeholder in the peace process. The coming talks may shape the prospects for ending the prolonged conflict.</p>
<h2>Middle East: Renewed Violence in Gaza</h2>
<p>Tensions escalated in Gaza as Israeli military strikes killed 25 Palestinians. These attacks followed gunfire by militants against Israeli soldiers, actions said to violate a ceasefire that has been in place for five weeks. The Israeli military targeted several Hamas positions in response. This development disrupts recent calm and highlights the fragility of the ceasefire, with possible consequences for stability in the region if hostilities continue.</p>
<h2>United States: Justice Department Ordered to Release Epstein Files</h2>
<p>In Washington, US President Donald Trump signed a bill mandating the Justice Department to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days. The directive requires the files to be provided in a searchable format. The move comes amid ongoing public interest in the Epstein case, and the release could shed new light on investigations. It remains to be seen how the department will proceed and what revelations may emerge.</p>
<h2>Law and Politics: Spanish Attorney General Convicted</h2>
<p>Spain’s attorney general, Álvaro García Ortiz, has been convicted in a controversial case involving leaked information. As a result, he is barred from his position for two years and must pay €10,000 in compensation. This verdict underscores the legal and political ramifications surrounding the handling of sensitive information in Spain’s judiciary.</p>
<h2>Social Unrest in the US: Immigration Crackdown in Charlotte</h2>
<p>Authorities arrested more than 250 people in Charlotte during an intensified immigration enforcement operation. Local Democratic leaders criticized the actions, accusing border agents of creating fear within the community. The arrest surge reflects the broader national debate over immigration policies and their impacts on local populations, with potential implications for law enforcement and community relations.</p>
<h2>Global Environment: Fire Disrupts UN Climate Talks in Brazil</h2>
