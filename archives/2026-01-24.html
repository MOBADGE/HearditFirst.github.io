    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and Canada have increased after Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods if Canada makes a trade deal with China. This development follows a period of strained relations between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Meanwhile, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen visited Greenland to show support following recent warnings from Trump suggesting the US might take control over the territory. These events highlight ongoing diplomatic challenges involving trade and territorial claims.</p>
<p>In Europe, German authorities arrested a Lebanese man suspected of membership in Hamas. Prosecutors stated that he was involved in planning attacks targeting Jewish and Israeli institutions across the continent, marking an important counterterrorism action in the region.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine War and Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Diplomatic efforts to resolve the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine saw a new development with three-way peace talks involving representatives from Russia, Ukraine, and a third party. While no breakthroughs were reported at this initial meeting, sources indicated that discussions are expected to continue next month. The continued fighting amid failed negotiations underscores the complexity of reaching a lasting resolution in the region.</p>
<h2>US Military Strategy Shift</h2>
<p>The Pentagon announced a new national defence strategy that includes offering “more limited” support to US allies. This shift could signal changes in how the US engages with alliance partners globally, potentially affecting future military cooperation and international security dynamics.</p>
<h2>China’s Military and Political Moves</h2>
<p>China has placed a high-ranking general under investigation in what is seen as part of President Xi’s broader effort to consolidate power. The investigations are criticized by some as moves to purge political rivals within the country’s leadership. This development may impact China's internal political environment and stability within the military establishment.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>A tragic end came to a shark attack in Sydney Harbour when 12-year-old Nico Antic died from his injuries sustained the previous Sunday while swimming. The incident has raised concerns about water safety in the area.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, a landslide in a West Java village resulted in the deaths of seven people. Rescue operations continue as 83 villagers remain unaccounted for, with teams working under difficult conditions to find survivors or confirm casualties.</p>
<h2>Human Interest</h2>
<p>Alex Honnold, known for his rope-free climbing challenges, delayed his attempt to scale Taipei 101, one of the world’s tallest buildings in Taiwan, due to rain. His climb is highly anticipated and highlights ongoing interest in extreme sports activities around iconic urban landmarks.</p>
