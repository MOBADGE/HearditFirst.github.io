    <h2>US-Canada Trade Tensions</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and Canada have escalated after Trump issued a social media post threatening to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods. The threat comes amid disagreements over a trade deal involving China. This move could have significant economic implications for both countries and may affect trade relations moving forward. Meanwhile, in response to these tensions, the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen traveled to Greenland to show support for the territory following the US president's previous statements about potentially taking control of Greenland.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict and Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Two days of peace negotiations involving Russia and Ukraine concluded without a clear breakthrough. Despite talks aimed at resolving the conflict, Russia continued its military bombardment in Ukraine. The ongoing violence has had severe humanitarian impacts, compounded by the targeting of heating plants in Ukrainian cities. This strategy, linked to Soviet-era urban planning, has left thousands without heat during winter, worsening living conditions amid the conflict.</p>
<h2>Changes in US Defence Strategy</h2>
<p>The Pentagon announced a shift in the national defence strategy, stating it will provide “more limited” support to US allies. This change reflects a potential reevaluation of America’s international military commitments and could influence global security dynamics and partnerships in the coming years.</p>
<h2>China’s Military Investigation</h2>
<p>China has placed its highest-ranking general under investigation amid a broader campaign led by President Xi. The investigations have drawn criticism, with some accusing Xi of using them to purge political rivals. The developments highlight ongoing internal political struggles within China’s military and government institutions.</p>
<h2>Regional Disasters and Protests</h2>
<p>New Zealand has officially called off rescue efforts for six people missing after a recent landslide, with authorities not expecting to find any more survivors. In the United States, widespread protests continue in Minnesota, where hundreds of businesses closed in solidarity against an immigration crackdown by ICE. Thousands have joined these protests, signaling strong public opposition to the enforcement measures.</p>
<h2>Notable Events</h2>
<p>In a lighter note, climber Alex Honnold postponed his rope-free challenge to scale Taipei 101 in Taiwan due to rain. Additionally, a tragic incident in Sydney Harbour saw the death of 12-year-old Nico Antic following a shark attack last week, raising concerns about beach safety in the area.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These events reflect ongoing geopolitical tensions, shifting defence policies, and significant humanitarian and social challenges around the world.</p>
