    <h2>US-Canada Trade Tensions Rise</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods in response to a new trade agreement between Canada and China. The threat came via a social media post amid growing tensions between the US and its northern neighbor. This move could significantly impact trade relations in North America, raising uncertainty for businesses that rely on cross-border commerce. Canada’s response and further developments will be closely watched.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Conflict and Peace Efforts in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Two days of peace talks involving Russia, Ukraine, and a third party have ended without any clear breakthroughs. Despite the negotiations, Russian forces continue their bombardment in Ukraine. The failure to reach an agreement leaves the violence ongoing and exacerbates the humanitarian and political crisis in the region. Meanwhile, Russian attacks have targeted heating plants in Ukrainian cities, affecting thousands amid harsh winter conditions, a tactic linked to Soviet-era urban planning.</p>
<h2>Shifts in US Defence Strategy</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has announced a new national defence strategy that will provide “more limited” support to US allies. This shift indicates a potential change in how the US engages with its partners around the world, possibly focusing on more targeted or constrained military assistance. The strategy update may reshape international defence cooperation and influence global security dynamics.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in China</h2>
<p>China has placed one of its highest-ranking generals under investigation, a move seen within the context of President Xi’s actions to consolidate power. Critics accuse the leadership of using such investigations to purge political rivals. This development highlights continuing internal political struggles within China’s ruling structure and may affect the country’s military and political landscape.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Tragedies</h2>
<p>In Australia, a 12-year-old boy named Nico Antic has died from injuries sustained in a shark attack in Sydney Harbour last Sunday. His death has prompted a renewed focus on beach and water safety in the region.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, authorities have called off rescue efforts for six people still missing after a recent landslide. Police do not expect to find any more survivors, marking a tragic end to the search and affecting families and communities in the area.</p>
<h2>Protests and Regional Politics</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, hundreds of businesses have closed in protest against a prolonged immigration crackdown led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Thousands of people have participated in these protests, reflecting widespread opposition to current immigration enforcement policies in the state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Greenland, the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen visited as a “show of support” following recent tensions due to warnings from Donald Trump that the US might seek control over the territory. The visit aims to reassure Greenland’s residents amidst geopolitical concerns.</p>
