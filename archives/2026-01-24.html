    <h2>International Trade Tensions</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and Canada have escalated following a social media post by Trump, who threatened Canada with 100% tariffs over a trade deal involving China. This development signals a sharp rise in trade disputes between the two neighbours and may complicate economic relations. Meanwhile, the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, visited Greenland to show support amid ongoing tensions sparked by Trump’s warnings that the US might take control of the territory.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Humanitarian Impact in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Two days of peace talks involving Russia, Ukraine, and a third party concluded without any apparent breakthrough, as Russian attacks on Ukraine continue. In addition to ongoing bombardments, the strategy behind the conflict is affecting civilian infrastructure. Soviet-era urban planning has made many people vulnerable to the loss of heating, as Russian forces target heating plants, worsening conditions in the scheduled winter months.</p>
<h2>Shifts in US Defence Strategy</h2>
<p>The Pentagon announced a change in the US national defence strategy, stating it will provide “more limited” support to its allies in the future. This shift reflects a possible reassessment of United States' global military commitments and could influence how allied countries approach joint defence planning and international cooperation.</p>
<h2>Severe Weather Warning in the United States</h2>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a warning about an impending winter storm described as "extremely dangerous." The storm poses a life-threatening risk of hypothermia, prompting concerns for public safety and urging residents to prepare accordingly as the cold weather system moves in.</p>
<h2>Notable Incidents and Events</h2>
<p>Tragic news came from Australia, where a 12-year-old boy named Nico Antic died from injuries sustained in a shark attack in Sydney Harbour. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, authorities called off rescue operations for six individuals missing after a landslide, acknowledging that survival is unlikely. On a lighter note, climber Alex Honnold postponed his rope-free attempt to scale Taipei 101, one of the tallest buildings in the world, due to rain conditions, highlighting ongoing challenges in adventurous pursuits.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in China</h2>
<p>In China, the highest-ranking general has been placed under investigation, with President Xi facing accusations of using such investigations to remove political rivals. This investigation is an important development in understanding the internal dynamics of power within China’s leadership.</p>
