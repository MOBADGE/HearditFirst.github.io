    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Tensions are rising between the United States and Canada after Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs if Canada makes a deal with China. This warning comes amid escalating friction between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Meanwhile, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen visited Greenland to show support following recent threats from Trump, who suggested he could take control of the territory. These developments reflect increasing strains in international relationships involving the US.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Two days of peace talks involving Russia and Ukraine have concluded without any breakthrough, as Russia continues to carry out attacks amid ongoing conflict. In other security news, Germany arrested a Lebanese man suspected of being a member of Hamas. Prosecutors say he helped plan attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions in Europe. Additionally, the Pentagon announced a new national defence strategy that will provide “more limited” support to US allies, indicating a shift in how the US plans to engage with its global partners militarily.</p>
<h2>China’s Political Developments</h2>
<p>China has placed its highest-ranking general under investigation. This move is part of a broader pattern under President Xi, who has been accused of using military and political investigations to remove rivals. The investigation signals continuing internal political consolidation within China’s leadership.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>In Indonesia, rescue efforts continue after a landslide in a West Java village killed seven people, with 83 still missing. The search for survivors and the missing is ongoing in difficult conditions. In Australia, a 12-year-old boy named Nico Antic died from injuries sustained during a shark attack in Sydney Harbour last Sunday, prompting renewed discussions about beach safety.</p>
<h2>Human Interest</h2>
<p>American climber Alex Honnold is attempting a challenging climb of Taipei 101, one of the world’s tallest buildings in Taiwan. His rope-free ascent was delayed over concerns about rain, highlighting the risks he takes in his record-breaking climbs.</p>
<h2>Military Praise and Criticism</h2>
<p>Donald Trump praised UK soldiers in Afghanistan, calling them “among the greatest of all warriors.” However, this came shortly after his claim that allied forces largely avoided front-line combat during the Afghanistan conflict, a statement that drew attention to the complexities of coalition military roles there.</p>
