    <h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and Canada have escalated after former US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if it strikes a deal with China. This development adds to growing strains between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Simultaneously, the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen visited Greenland to demonstrate support amid rising tensions with the US, following Trump's warnings about the potential US control over the territory.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>Peace talks aimed at resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict have concluded without any breakthroughs. The discussions, involving three parties, ended with ongoing fighting reported on the ground. However, sources indicate that negotiations are expected to resume next month. Meanwhile, Trump praised UK soldiers in Afghanistan, calling them "among the greatest of all warriors," despite previously asserting that allied forces had avoided frontline combat during that conflict.</p>
<h2>Security and Defence</h2>
<p>Germany arrested a Lebanese man suspected of membership in Hamas. Prosecutors allege he was involved in planning attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions across Europe. On another front, the US Pentagon announced a shift in its national defence strategy, pledging to offer "more limited" support to US allies moving forward. This marks a significant change in how the US intends to engage with partner countries in defence matters.</p>
<h2>Asia-Pacific Events</h2>
<p>China has placed its highest-ranking general under investigation, amid accusations that President Xi uses such probes to eliminate political rivals. In Taiwan, climber Alex Honnold postponed his attempt to scale Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest buildings, without ropes due to rain, delaying the highly risky challenge.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>In Australia, 12-year-old Nico Antic died from injuries sustained in a shark attack in Sydney Harbour last Sunday. In Indonesia, a landslide in a West Java village has killed seven people, with rescue teams searching for 83 others still missing. Emergency efforts continue as authorities attempt to locate those unaccounted for.</p>
