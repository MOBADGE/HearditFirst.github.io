    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukraine has condemned recent Russian strikes as "brutal" ahead of the resumption of trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi. The attacks resulted in one death and 35 injuries. These discussions are seen as a critical opportunity to seek resolution, but ongoing violence underscores the fragile situation in the region. How these talks proceed could have significant implications for stability and security in Eastern Europe.</p>
<h2>US Defence Strategy Update</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has announced a shift in its national defence strategy, indicating it will provide “more limited” support to US allies going forward. This signals a potential realignment of US military commitments worldwide. The change may affect how US partners approach their own defence planning and international cooperation in security matters.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters in Indonesia and New Zealand</h2>
<p>Indonesia and New Zealand continue coping with deadly landslides. In West Java, Indonesia, seven people have died while dozens are still missing, with search efforts ongoing for around 83 unaccounted individuals. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, rescue operations have been called off after officials concluded there are no survivors among six people missing from a recent landslide. These disasters highlight the ongoing challenges faced by communities vulnerable to environmental hazards.</p>
<h2>Protests and Social Issues in the US</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, hundreds of businesses temporarily closed in protest against a prolonged immigration crackdown involving the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Thousands have joined widespread demonstrations against the enforcement campaign. These protests reflect broader tensions around immigration policies in the United States.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Weather Warning in the US</h2>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a warning about an "extremely dangerous" winter storm approaching the US. The storm is expected to bring life-threatening cold temperatures and pose a serious risk of hypothermia. Residents in affected areas are being urged to prepare carefully for hazardous conditions in the coming days.</p>
