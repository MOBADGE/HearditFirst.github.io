    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Ukraine has condemned recent Russian strikes as "brutal" ahead of the second day of peace talks involving three parties in Abu Dhabi. The attacks resulted in one death and injured 23 people. The discussions are part of ongoing efforts to seek resolution to the conflict, but the violence underscores continued tensions and the challenges to achieving peace.</p>
<h2>US Defence Strategy Update</h2>
<p>The Pentagon announced a new national defence strategy that will involve offering "more limited" support to US allies compared to previous approaches. This marks a significant shift in US defence policy, likely affecting American military cooperation and assistance with partner countries. The strategy aims to adjust how the US manages global security commitments amid a changing geopolitical landscape.</p>
<h2>Tragic Shark Attack in Sydney</h2>
<p>A 12-year-old boy named Nico Antic died from injuries sustained in a shark attack while swimming in Sydney Harbour last Sunday. This incident has caused widespread sorrow and raised awareness about beach and water safety in the area. Officials may review current safety measures to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<h2>Data Collection Changes for TikTok US Users</h2>
<p>TikTok's US venture updated its privacy policy to include expanded access to precise user location data. This change highlights growing concerns about user privacy and the handling of personal information by social media platforms. The new policy is likely to spark further discussion about data security and the balance between service functionality and user protection.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Storm Warning in the United States</h2>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a warning about an "extremely dangerous" winter storm moving across parts of the United States. The storm is expected to bring conditions that pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia. Residents in affected areas are being advised to prepare and stay safe as the storm progresses.</p>
<h2>Protests and Business Closures in Minnesota</h2>
<p>Hundreds of businesses in Minnesota closed temporarily as thousands of people protested against a weeks-long immigration crackdown by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The widespread demonstrations reflect community opposition to current immigration enforcement policies and indicate ongoing tensions around this issue in the state.</p>
