    <h2>US National Defence Strategy Updates</h2>
<p>The United States has shifted its national defence priorities, no longer listing China as its top security concern. According to a newly released defence strategy document, the US plans to offer “more limited” support to its allies moving forward. This change reflects a reassessment of global threats and may lead to adjustments in military focus and international partnerships. How this shift will affect ongoing global security dynamics remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Tragic Shark Attack in Sydney</h2>
<p>A 12-year-old boy named Nico Antic died after being attacked by a shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour last Sunday. Authorities have confirmed his death, marking a rare but fatal incident in the area. This tragedy highlights ongoing concerns about marine safety in heavily used public waterways and may prompt renewed discussions about protective measures for swimmers.</p>
<h2>TikTok to Collect Detailed Location Data in US</h2>
<p>TikTok’s US operations will begin collecting more precise user location data, as outlined in a new privacy policy published by the social media company. This expanded access includes more detailed location information than previously gathered. The development raises questions about user privacy and data security, especially given TikTok’s widespread popularity. Users and regulators will likely monitor how this data is used and protected in the future.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Storm Expected in the US</h2>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued warnings about an “extremely dangerous” winter storm that threatens large parts of the United States. Officials emphasize that the storm poses a life-threatening risk of hypothermia due to cold temperatures and hazardous conditions. The forecast calls for communities to prepare for severe weather impacts, including potential disruptions and the need for emergency responses.</p>
<h2>Protests and Business Closures in Minnesota</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, protests continue to grow against the ongoing immigration crackdown by US immigration enforcement (ICE). Hundreds of businesses have chosen to close temporarily in solidarity with the demonstrators. Thousands of people are participating in the protests, which reflect wider tensions over immigration policies and enforcement actions. The demonstrations could influence local and national discussions on immigration reform.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Tensions in the Arctic and Greenland</h2>
<p>In Greenland, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen made a visit seen as a “show of support” after recent threats from the US president concerning possible control over the territory. This visit follows a period of heightened tension and underlines the strategic importance of Greenland in Arctic geopolitics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada is strengthening its military presence in the Arctic amid concerns about pressures from both the US and Russia. This ramp-up aims to demonstrate Canada's capability to defend its Arctic territories, a critical region as global interest in the Arctic’s resources and strategic position increases. Additionally, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments on Alberta separatism have added to cross-border political discussions, highlighting the complex relations between Ottawa and Washington.</p>
