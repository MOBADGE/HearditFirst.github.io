    <h2>Ukraine and Russia Peace Talks Continue Amid Ongoing Strikes</h2>
<p>As peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, and a third party were set to resume in Abu Dhabi, Ukraine condemned what it described as "brutal" Russian strikes. These attacks resulted in one death and 23 injuries, highlighting continuing violence despite diplomatic efforts. The resumption of trilateral discussions signals ongoing attempts to find a resolution, though the timing of strikes raises concerns over the talks' viability and potential outcomes.</p>
<h2>Changes in U.S. Defense Strategy</h2>
<p>The Pentagon announced a shift in the United States' national defense strategy, indicating it will provide "more limited" support to its allies moving forward. This adjustment reflects evolving priorities in U.S. military and foreign policy. While specific impacts are yet to be clarified, the reduced support could affect alliance dynamics and international security collaborations.</p>
<h2>Deadly Natural Disasters in Indonesia and New Zealand</h2>
<p>Tragic landslides have struck Southeast Asia and the Pacific. In Indonesia's West Java village, seven people have died, and rescue teams continue searching for 83 missing individuals after the landslide. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, rescue efforts for six missing persons following a landslide have been called off as police do not expect to find survivors. These disasters underline the ongoing risks of natural hazards in vulnerable regions and the challenges faced in recovery operations.</p>
<h2>Protests and Business Closures in Minnesota Over Immigration Crackdown</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, thousands of people have taken part in widespread protests against a recent immigration crackdown. To support the demonstrations, hundreds of businesses temporarily closed as a form of protest against the increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This reflects growing community resistance to immigration enforcement actions and highlights the social tensions involved.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Storm Warning in the United States</h2>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a warning about an "extremely dangerous" winter storm expected to hit parts of the United States. Officials caution that the storm poses a life-threatening risk of hypothermia for those exposed to the cold. Residents are advised to prepare accordingly as the storm approaches, which could have significant impacts on public safety and daily life.</p>
<h2>Privacy Concerns Over TikTok's U.S. Operations</h2>
<p>TikTok’s U.S. venture has updated its privacy policy to include expanded access to users' precise location data. This change has raised concerns about data privacy and the extent of information collected by popular social media platforms. Users and regulators may closely monitor how this data is used and protected going forward.</p>
