    <h2>International Trade Tensions</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and Canada have escalated after Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods. The threat was made in a social media post amid disagreements over a trade deal involving China. This development highlights ongoing trade disputes between the US and its northern neighbor. The situation remains uncertain and could affect economic relations and cross-border trade policies in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Two days of peace talks involving Ukraine, Russia, and a third party have ended without any breakthroughs. Despite the negotiations, Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian territories. A related issue concerns the targeting of heating plants by Russian forces, which is impacting thousands of residents, particularly in urban areas influenced by Soviet-era infrastructure. This strategy is adding to the difficulties faced by civilians during the conflict, especially as winter conditions persist.</p>
<h2>Changes in US Defense Strategy</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has announced a shift in the United States’ defense strategy. According to a new national defense strategy document, the US will provide “more limited” support to its allies. While details are not fully outlined, this signals a potential change in how the US approaches military partnerships and international commitments going forward.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in China</h2>
<p>China is conducting an investigation into its highest-ranking general, an event that comes amid accusations that President Xi uses such inquiries to remove political rivals. This development points to ongoing power struggles within the Chinese government and may have implications for the country’s military and political landscape.</p>
<h2>Regional and Human Interest Stories</h2>
<p>In Greenland, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen visited the territory to show support after a period of increased tensions linked to the US president’s suggestion he might take control of Greenland. Meanwhile, protest activity continues in Minnesota, where hundreds of businesses closed in opposition to a recent immigration enforcement crackdown. Thousands of people have taken part in these protests.</p>
<p>On the humanitarian front, rescue efforts in New Zealand have been called off after a landslide, with six people still missing and little hope of finding survivors. Separately, a 12-year-old boy named Nico Antic died from injuries sustained in a shark attack in Sydney Harbour last weekend.</p>
<h2>Sports and Recreation</h2>
<p>Climber Alex Honnold is attempting a notable challenge by planning to scale Taipei 101 in Taiwan without the use of ropes. However, the attempt has been delayed due to rain. This event has attracted attention for its daring nature and the skill required to undertake such a climb.</p>
