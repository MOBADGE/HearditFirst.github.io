    <h2>Conflict and Peace Talks in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukraine has condemned Russian strikes that took place ahead of the second day of trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi. The attack resulted in one death and left 35 people injured. These talks involve discussions aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict. The continuation of the talks despite the violence highlights the fragile state of negotiations and the ongoing humanitarian impact.</p>
<h2>Changes in US Defence Strategy</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has announced a shift in the US national defence strategy, signalling "more limited" support to US allies. Details from the newly released defence document indicate a recalibration of military commitments. This approach may affect global US military partnerships and how they contribute to collective security efforts.</p>
<h2>Severe Weather Warning in the US</h2>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a warning about an "extremely dangerous" winter storm expected to hit parts of the United States. The storm poses a life-threatening risk of hypothermia due to severe cold conditions. Residents in affected areas are advised to prepare accordingly as the storm could disrupt daily life and transport.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters in Indonesia and New Zealand</h2>
<p>In Indonesia, a landslide in West Java has killed at least seven people with dozens more missing. Rescue teams continue searching for 83 individuals unaccounted for in the village affected by the disaster. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, rescue efforts have been called off for six people missing after a separate landslide. Officials do not expect to find any more survivors. Both events highlight ongoing risks from natural disasters and the challenges in emergency response.</p>
<h2>Protests and Business Closures in Minnesota</h2>
<p>Hundreds of businesses in Minnesota temporarily closed as thousands participated in protests against a state immigration crackdown. The demonstrations reflect widespread community opposition to the presence and actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This unrest underscores the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement policies in the US.</p>
<h2>Technology and Privacy Concerns with TikTok</h2>
<p>TikTok’s US operation has updated its privacy policy to include plans to collect more precise location data from users. This expansion of location data access raises concerns about user privacy and how such information might be used. As TikTok remains popular among many users, these changes are likely to prompt further discussion about digital privacy protections.</p>
