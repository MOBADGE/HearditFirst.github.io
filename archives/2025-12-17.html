    <h2>Australia Bondi Beach Shooting</h2>
<p>Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 15 counts of murder related to the recent shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach. In total, he faces 59 charges following the attack that took place on Sunday. Among those killed was Rabbi Schlanger, a UK-born community figure remembered for spreading "love and joy" and mourned deeply in a funeral service. This tragic event has profoundly affected both the local and religious communities. Further legal proceedings will determine the full consequences for Akram and aim to provide justice for the victims and their families.</p>
<h2>Venezuela-U.S. Tensions Over Oil and Blockade</h2>
<p>Tensions between Venezuela and the United States have escalated again, with Venezuela denouncing a U.S. order for a ship blockade as “warmongering threats.” This comes shortly after the U.S. seized an oil tanker near Venezuela’s coast, aiming to increase pressure on Nicolás Maduro’s government. These developments highlight ongoing geopolitical friction and economic sanctions that may impact regional stability and international relations moving forward.</p>

The restrictions also now target holders of Palestinian Authority passports. Meanwhile, in South Africa, seven Kenyan workers at a U.S.-supported refugee processing center faced deportation after being found to lack valid work visas. These developments underline continued tightening of U.S. immigration and border control policies.</p>
<h2>Social Controversies and Crime in South Africa</h2>
