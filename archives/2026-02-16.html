    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 16, 2026</div>
    <h2>Justice and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>The FBI is investigating evidence linked to the case of Savannah Guthrie’s mother, following the recovery of a glove from a field near their home. The agency has obtained a DNA sample from the glove, which may have implications for the ongoing inquiry. Meanwhile, in Australia, a 24-year-old accused in the Bondi Beach shooting has appeared in court for the first time. The individual faces 59 charges, including 15 counts of murder and one count related to a terrorist attack, marking a significant step in the legal process.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has called on Iran to cease enriching uranium and halt any further production. His remarks come ahead of planned talks between Iran and the US in Geneva, which will focus on negotiations over a nuclear agreement. These discussions carry weight for regional security and the future of diplomatic efforts surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.</p>
<p>In addition, Israel witnessed a tense incident in the city of Bnei Brak where two female soldiers were forced to flee from a group of ultra-Orthodox men. Police intervened to assist the women, underscoring ongoing social and religious tensions within the country.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Shifts in Europe</h2>
<p>European nations are currently reassessing their strategic alliances in the face of what has been described as a new global order shaped by former US president Trump’s policies. Countries across the continent are debating whether traditional partnerships remain sufficient or if they should diversify their international relations moving forward. This reflection may influence Europe’s approach to security, trade, and diplomacy in the near term.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Missing Persons</h2>
<p>Sydney police are appealing for help in locating an 85-year-old man, Chris Baghsarian, who was mistakenly kidnapped. Authorities express strong confidence that Baghsarian was not the intended target of the abduction, and the search continues with hopes for his safe return.</p>
<h2>Technology and Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>ByteDance, the tech company behind the AI video app Seedance, has announced plans to limit certain features following legal pressure from Disney. The app had gained attention for videos using Disney’s characters, such as Spider-Man, which Disney claims infringe on their intellectual property rights. This case illustrates ongoing challenges at the intersection of AI technology and copyright laws.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Kenya, a labor strike at a major international airport has caused flight delays. Authorities have implemented contingency plans to manage disruptions affecting travelers.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s government has also issued warnings against illegal recruitment efforts that send citizens abroad to fight, especially amid reports of Nigerian deaths in Ukraine. Officials are urging citizens to avoid participating in foreign conflicts, highlighting concerns over the safety and legality of such enlistments.</p>
<p>Additionally, new information has emerged about the toxin epibatidine, allegedly used in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny. This toxic compound is found naturally in South American frogs but can also be produced synthetically, adding complexity to investigations into the case.</p>
