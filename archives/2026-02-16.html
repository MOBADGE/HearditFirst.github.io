    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 16, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The US has increased its military presence near Iran, with the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and fighter jets tracked in the region ahead of talks between the two countries. This build-up may reflect heightened tensions or strategic positioning as diplomatic discussions approach. The outcome of the talks could influence regional stability and future relations between the US and Iran.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>In Australia, a 24-year-old accused in a shooting at Bondi Beach has appeared in court for the first time. Facing 59 charges, including 15 counts of murder and one related to a terrorist attack, the case is developing as authorities pursue justice. In the US, the FBI continues to investigate the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's mother. Investigators recovered a glove containing DNA from a nearby field, renewing calls for her release and offering hope for progress in the case.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict</h2>
<p>Attention remains on families linked to the Islamic State group held in Syria's Roj camp. Thirty-four women and children, detained for nearly seven years, sought to return to Australia but were turned back. Their situation highlights ongoing challenges related to displaced persons and the complexities of repatriating individuals connected to conflict zones.</p>
<p>Separately, pressure is mounting for the release of remaining political prisoners in Venezuela. An NGO notes hundreds remain imprisoned despite US appeals for faster action, underscoring continuing human rights concerns and international calls for justice.</p>
<h2>History and Archaeology</h2>
<p>Ancient remains may have provided the first concrete proof that war elephants crossed the Alps under General Hannibal. The discovery of a bone linked to the legendary event offers new insight into military history, potentially confirming detailed accounts of Hannibal’s tactics during the Punic Wars.</p>
<h2>Reflections on Notable Figures</h2>
<p>On the second anniversary of Alexei Navalny’s death, his mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, affirmed her belief that he was murdered, following poison findings. Her statement suggests ongoing controversy and unresolved questions about the circumstances of his death while in detention.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a look at the career of Robert Duvall celebrates his contributions to Hollywood through memorable roles in films like *Apocalypse Now* and *The Godfather*. His prolific work has left a lasting impact on the film industry.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>European countries are reevaluating their security strategies amid shifts in the global order attributed to recent US policies described as a "new world order." Nations are considering whether existing alliances suffice or if diversification of partnerships is necessary to navigate the changing geopolitical landscape. This reassessment may shape future European foreign and defense policies.</p>
