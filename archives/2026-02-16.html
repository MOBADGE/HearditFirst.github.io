    <h2>Legal Developments in Savannah Guthrie Case</h2>
<p>The FBI has recovered a DNA sample from a glove found in a field near Savannah Guthrie’s home. This discovery is part of ongoing efforts to investigate her mother’s case. Savannah Guthrie has made a renewed public appeal for her mother’s release, emphasizing that it is never too late to seek justice. The analysis of the glove by the FBI could provide important evidence as the case progresses.</p>
<h2>Iran Nuclear Talks Ahead of Geneva Meeting</h2>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Iran to stop enriching uranium and halt further production. His statements come just before a scheduled meeting in Geneva, where Iran and the United States are set to discuss a potential nuclear deal. These talks are seen as critical for regional security and the control of nuclear materials.</p>
<h2>ByteDance Limits AI Video App Following Disney’s Legal Threat</h2>
<p>ByteDance, the company behind popular video-sharing platforms, announced plans to restrict its AI video app. This follows legal pressure from Disney, whose characters such as Spider-Man have been widely used without permission in viral videos created with the app. The move highlights ongoing concerns about intellectual property rights in the development and use of AI technologies.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Dart Frog Toxin Linked to Navalny</h2>
