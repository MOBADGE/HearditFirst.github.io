    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>International Security</h2>
<p>The US has deployed a significant military presence near Iran, with BBC Verify tracking the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and accompanying fighter jets in the region. This build-up comes ahead of scheduled talks between the two countries and could influence diplomatic negotiations. The presence of these warships signals heightened tension but also suggests the US is prepared to demonstrate military strength as discussions proceed.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>In Australia, the accused in the Bondi Beach shooting has appeared in court for the first time. The 24-year-old faces 59 charges, including 15 counts of murder and one count of committing a terrorist attack. This case is drawing significant attention as the legal process moves forward. Meanwhile, in the United States, FBI agents have recovered a DNA sample from a glove found near the home of Savannah Guthrie’s mother, who remains missing. This development has brought renewed calls, including from Guthrie herself, urging authorities not to give up on the search.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict</h2>
<p>A group of 34 women and children linked to the Islamic State has been turned back after attempting to leave the Roj camp in Syria, where they have been detained for nearly seven years. These families, originally from Australia, remain in difficult conditions with limited options for repatriation or resettlement. Separately, pressure is mounting on Venezuelan authorities regarding political prisoners. An NGO reports that hundreds remain incarcerated despite ongoing US calls to expedite their release, highlighting continuing concerns about human rights and political freedoms in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Historical Discoveries</h2>
<p>Researchers may have found the first physical evidence supporting the ancient story of war elephants crossing the Alps with General Hannibal. An ancient bone discovered could confirm that elephants played a role in historic battles, providing new insights into military strategies of the past. This discovery helps illuminate archaeological and historical debates about how Hannibal conducted his campaigns during the Second Punic War.</p>
<h2>Memorial and Accountability</h2>
<p>On the second anniversary of Alexei Navalny’s death, his mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, stated that she always believed her son was murdered rather than having died naturally in prison. This statement follows findings of poison that support claims of foul play, keeping attention on the circumstances surrounding Navalny’s death and the broader issues of political repression.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>A tribute to actor Robert Duvall explores his extensive film career, featuring iconic works such as *Apocalypse Now* and *The Godfather*. Known for his prolific range, Duvall's contributions have made a lasting impact on Hollywood and cinema lovers worldwide. The retrospective serves as a reminder of his influence on the film industry across decades.</p>
