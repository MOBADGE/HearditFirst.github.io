    <h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>US military activity has increased near Iran ahead of upcoming talks between the two countries. BBC Verify has tracked the US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln along with fighter jets in the vicinity of Iran. This deployment signals heightened tensions but also the possibility of diplomatic engagement. The presence of powerful US naval forces may be intended as a show of strength or a measure to ensure security during sensitive negotiations.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Legacy</h2>
<p>Actor Robert Duvall, known for iconic roles in films such as *The Godfather* and *Apocalypse Now*, has died at the age of 95. His family announced he passed away peacefully at his home in Middleburg, Virginia. Duvall had a prolific career spanning decades and was celebrated for his versatility and depth as an actor. His death marks the end of an era for Hollywood fans and leaves a lasting legacy on American cinema.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict Zones</h2>
<p>A group of 34 women and children linked to the Islamic State group has been turned back after attempting to leave the Roj camp in Syria and return to Australia. These families have been held in the camp for nearly seven years, raising questions about repatriation, security, and humanitarian responsibilities. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, pressure is mounting on authorities to release hundreds of remaining political prisoners. A non-governmental organization highlighted ongoing US efforts to accelerate their release amid concerns over human rights.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings and Public Safety</h2>
<p>The accused in the Bondi Beach shooting has appeared in court for the first time. The 24-year-old faces a total of 59 charges, including 15 counts of murder and one related to committing a terrorist attack. This case has drawn significant attention due to the scale and severity of the allegations, with the judicial process expected to explore the details and motives behind the tragedy.</p>
<h2>Historical Discoveries</h2>
<p>Researchers may have found the first physical evidence supporting the long-held belief that General Hannibal used war elephants to cross the Alps. An ancient bone potentially linked to these legendary animals has been uncovered, which could provide new insights into historical military strategies and the realities behind one of history’s most famous campaigns.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Investigations</h2>
<p>FBI analysis continues in the case of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother. A glove discovered in a field near the home, containing a DNA sample, is currently being examined for clues. Guthrie has publicly urged for her mother’s release, emphasizing that it is “never too late,” as the investigation remains open and active.</p>
