    <h2>International Cultural Recognitions</h2>
<p>UNESCO has added several cultural practices to its list of intangible cultural heritage. Among the newly recognized are Italian cooking, Icelandic pool culture, Cuban music, Albanian lahuta music, and an Egyptian snack. This designation helps preserve and promote these traditions around the world, highlighting their social and historical significance.</p>
<h2>Eurovision Boycott Expands</h2>
<p>Iceland has announced it will boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, joining Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands in this decision. The reasons for these boycotts have not been detailed, but the growing number of countries withdrawing from the contest may affect its future participation and international appeal.</p>
<h2>Political and Security Developments</h2>
<p>European leaders from Britain, France, and Germany emphasized that Ukraine is at a “critical moment” following a joint call with Donald Trump. They indicated that work on plans related to Ukraine is continuing intensively, suggesting ongoing diplomatic efforts to address the situation.</p>
<p>In Africa, a coup attempt in Benin was thwarted after Nigerian forces intervened by sending warplanes to remove mutineers from the state television offices. An official revealed that the leader of the coup plot is currently hiding in Togo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), rebels have reportedly entered Uvira, a strategic city near Burundi, despite a peace deal associated with Donald Trump. The arrival of rebels has led to heavy artillery exchanges and frightened residents, indicating instability in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Security Measures in the United States</h2>
<p>A federal judge has ordered the release of grand jury records from the 2019 Jeffrey Epstein case. The decision follows the enactment of a new law by Congress last month, which allows for these materials to be unsealed and made public.</p>
<p>Additionally, the U.S. is considering a new policy to require foreign tourists from visa-exempt countries, including the UK, to provide five years of social media history before entering the country. This measure aims to enhance security screening but could impact travel convenience for many visitors.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Morocco, two four-storey buildings collapsed in the city of Fez, killing at least 22 people. The buildings housed eight families, according to state media reports. Rescue efforts and investigations are likely ongoing.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban warned a group of young people over wearing clothing inspired by the TV show "Peaky Blinders," describing the outfits as “in conflict with Afghan and Islamic values.” This reflects ongoing tensions related to cultural norms and dress codes enforced by the ruling group.</p>
<p>Finally, U.S. military jets, specifically F/A-18 Super Hornets, were observed circling near Maracaibo, Venezuela’s second-largest city. The presence of these jets comes amid rising tensions in the Gulf of Venezuela, though no further details were provided.</p>
