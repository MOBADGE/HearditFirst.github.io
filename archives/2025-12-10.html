    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who currently lives in hiding, is reportedly on her way to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. This follows ongoing political tensions in Venezuela. Meanwhile, the United States has increased military activity near Venezuela’s coast, with F/A-18 Super Hornet jets tracked circling the Gulf of Venezuela, close to the city of Maracaibo.</p>
<p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, rebels have reportedly entered the key city of Uvira despite a recent peace deal endorsed by former US President Donald Trump. The city has experienced heavy artillery fire and gunfire, worrying residents and raising concerns about the stability of the region and its implications for neighboring Burundi.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and US Relations</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s leader has said the country is ready to hold elections if its international partners can guarantee security. This statement comes after former US President Donald Trump claimed Kyiv was using the ongoing war as a pretext to avoid elections. The situation remains delicate as Ukraine navigates its conflict with Russia and hinges on the support of its international allies.</p>
<h2>United States Visa and Immigration Policy</h2>
<p>The US government is considering a new measure that would require foreign tourists from visa-exempt countries, including the UK, to provide five years of social media history before being allowed entry. This proposal aims to enhance security checks, although it could affect millions of travelers and complicate the current visa waiver process.</p>
<p>In other US actions, the Treasury Department has sanctioned a network it says is recruiting Colombian fighters to take part in Sudan’s civil war. This network includes four entities and four individuals primarily based in Colombia, highlighting concerns about foreign fighters in the conflict.</p>
<h2>Public Health and Safety</h2>
<p>A troubling case has emerged involving a sperm donor with a gene known to cause cancer, who fathered nearly 200 children. Reports indicate that some of these children have already died, and only a minority of carriers are expected to avoid developing cancer in their lifetime. This case raises serious ethical and medical questions about donor screening and long-term health outcomes.</p>
<p>Separately, in Morocco, at least 22 people were killed after two four-storey buildings collapsed in the city of Fez. The buildings housed eight families, and this tragedy underscores ongoing concerns about building safety and infrastructure standards in the region.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Issues</h2>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban have warned people for wearing “un-Islamic” clothing inspired by the British TV show *Peaky Blinders*. A group of friends were cautioned by a Taliban spokesman that their outfits conflicted with Afghan and Islamic values, reflecting the strict dress codes enforced by the ruling group.</p>
<p>In South Africa, Brumelda Zuma, daughter of a former president, has been sworn in as a member of parliament for her father’s political party, following the resignation of her half-sister. This move continues to draw attention to the political influence of the Zuma family.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories reflect ongoing global challenges in governance, security, public health, and cultural norms as countries grapple with evolving political realities and societal expectations.</p>
