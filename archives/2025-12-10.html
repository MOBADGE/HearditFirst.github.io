    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>Health and Science</h2>
<p>Nearly 200 children have been conceived using sperm from a donor who carried a gene that significantly increases cancer risk. Some of these children have already died, and among those who inherited the mutation, only a small number are expected to avoid developing cancer at some point in their lives. This case raises serious concerns about genetic screening and the long-term health monitoring of donor-conceived children.</p>
<h2>International Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s leader stated the country is prepared to hold elections if its international partners can guarantee security. This statement came after repeated claims from US President Donald Trump that Kyiv was "using war" as an excuse to delay elections. Meanwhile, tensions continue in Southeast Asia where the US has urged Thailand and Cambodia to end ongoing clashes. Trump, who previously brokered a ceasefire, indicated plans to personally intervene with a phone call to try to stop the violence.</p>
<p>In East Asia, South Korea protested against Chinese and Russian military aircraft flying near or in its air defense zone. South Korean officials warned they would respond firmly to such incursions from neighbouring countries, reflecting ongoing regional security challenges.</p>
<h2>Domestic Unrest and Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Brazil, violent scuffles erupted in Congress during voting related to efforts aiming to reduce the jail sentence of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The disorder demonstrated deep political divides concerning Bolsonaro’s legal fate and underscored ongoing tensions in Brazilian politics.</p>
<h2>Economy and Public Sentiment</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump promoted an optimistic message about the economy, emphasizing his focus on "making America affordable again." This comes amid growing concerns among Americans about the rising cost of living, which has become a prominent issue in political campaigns. The president’s statements aim to reassure voters about economic stability and affordability.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Youth</h2>
<p>Australia is imposing a significant social media restriction affecting millions of teenagers who will no longer be allowed access to these platforms. The move has sparked debate over its impact on young people's freedom, social development, and digital engagement. Critics argue the ban is insulting to teens, suggesting they are capable of handling social media responsibly, while proponents see it as a protective measure.</p>
<h2>Environment and Conservation</h2>
<p>Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a pioneering figure in elephant conservation, has died at the age of 83. His influential research in the field helped drive the global ban on international ivory trade and strengthened efforts to protect elephants from poachers. His legacy is marked by significant contributions to wildlife preservation and anti-poaching campaigns worldwide.</p>
