    <h2>Health and Genetics</h2>
<p>Nearly 200 children have been conceived using sperm from a donor who carried a cancer-causing gene. Reports indicate that while some of these children have already died, only a minority who inherit the genetic mutation will avoid developing cancer during their lifetimes. This situation raises concerns about genetic screening and the long-term health monitoring of donor-conceived individuals.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in Brazil</h2>
<p>Tensions erupted in Brazil’s Congress during a vote related to efforts to reduce the jail sentence of former president Jair Bolsonaro. The session descended into scuffles, highlighting the deep political divisions surrounding Bolsonaro and the broader implications for Brazil’s justice system and political stability.</p>
<h2>Social Media Restrictions on Australian Teens</h2>
<p>Australia has implemented a new policy banning millions of teenagers under 16 from using social media. On the first day of the ban, affected teens demonstrated the difficulties in accessing their accounts. The move has sparked debate about the benefits and drawbacks of restricting young people’s digital activities, with questions about its impact on social development and online safety.</p>
<h2>Tragic Mining Accident in Sierra Leone</h2>
<p>Two teenagers seeking gold were buried alive in a mine collapse in Sierra Leone. The incident spotlights the broader issue of poverty driving students and young people into dangerous work. This tragic event underscores the risks faced by vulnerable populations in economically challenged regions.</p>
<h2>Notable Death in Wildlife Conservation</h2>
<p>Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a pioneering elephant conservationist, has died at the age of 83. His field research played a crucial role in pushing for the international ban on ivory trade and protecting elephants from poachers. His legacy influences ongoing efforts to conserve endangered wildlife.</p>
<h2>Economic Message from Trump Amid Cost of Living Concerns</h2>
<p>The U.S. president, Donald Trump, has emphasized a positive message regarding the economy, focusing on his goal of "making America affordable again." This comes as many Americans are feeling the strain of increased living costs, making economic issues a central point of political campaigns and public concern.</p>
