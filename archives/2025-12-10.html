    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>European leaders from Britain, France, and Germany emphasized that Ukraine is at a "critical moment" following a joint call with Donald Trump. The discussions suggest ongoing intense diplomatic efforts regarding the situation in Ukraine. Meanwhile, in West Africa, a coup attempt in Benin was thwarted after Nigerian forces intervened to remove mutineers from state TV offices. The alleged coup plot leader is reported to be hiding in neighboring Togo. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite a peace deal brokered involving Donald Trump, rebel forces have reportedly entered the key city of Uvira near the Burundi border amid intense fighting.</p>
<h2>Cultural Heritage Recognition</h2>
<p>UNESCO has added several new cultural practices and traditions to its list of intangible cultural heritage. Among those recognized are Italian cooking, an Egyptian snack, Iceland’s unique pool culture, Cuban music, and Albanian lahuta music. These designations acknowledge the cultural significance of these traditions and aim to help preserve them for the future.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>A federal judge has ruled that grand jury records from the 2019 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein can be released. This decision follows a new law passed by the U.S. Congress last month that allows for the unsealing of certain judicial materials tied to the case. The release of these documents could provide further insight into the investigation.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Social Policies</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck in Fez, Morocco, where two four-storey buildings collapsed. The buildings housed eight families, and at least 22 people have died in the incident. Rescue and recovery efforts are likely ongoing. Additionally, the United States is considering a new policy that could require foreign visitors from visa-exempt countries, including the UK, to provide five years' worth of social media history before being allowed entering the country. This reflects increasing security measures at American borders.</p>
<h2>Social and Political Pressures in Afghanistan</h2>
<p>The Taliban have issued warnings to Afghan individuals who were seen wearing clothing styles inspired by the TV show "Peaky Blinders," stating that such outfits conflict with Afghan and Islamic values. This reflects the group’s continued enforcement of strict cultural and religious codes.</p>
<h2>Eurovision Boycott</h2>
<p>Iceland has joined four other European countries—Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands—in declaring a boycott of the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. This makes Iceland the fifth country to take such a stand, signaling a coordinated decision that could affect the event's broad European participation.</p>
