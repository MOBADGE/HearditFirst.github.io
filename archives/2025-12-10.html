    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Rebel forces have reportedly entered the city of Uvira in the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite a recent peace agreement involving former US President Donald Trump. The city, which serves as a gateway to Burundi, has experienced heavy artillery fire and gun battles, causing fear among local residents. This development signals ongoing instability in the region just after the peace deal was announced.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, tensions are rising with the presence of US military jets, specifically F/A-18 Super Hornets, near Maracaibo, the country's second-largest city. These flights have been tracked publicly, adding to regional unease amid political and security challenges.</p>
<h2>US Domestic and Immigration Policy</h2>
<p>The US government is considering a new policy that would require foreign tourists from certain countries, including the UK, to submit five years of their social media history before entering the country. This requirement would apply even to visitors who currently can enter with a simple visa waiver form. The proposal is part of heightened security measures, reflecting ongoing debates about privacy and border control, and if implemented, could affect many travelers.</p>
<p>On a related legal front, a US federal judge has blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles that had been authorized in June. Control of these troops is to be returned to the governor of California, reflecting legal concerns over state versus federal authority in managing such deployments.</p>
<p>Additionally, a judge has ordered the release of materials related to the 2019 grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. This decision follows a new law passed by Congress last month, which allows for such documents to be unsealed. The release could provide new insight into the case.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Election Prospects</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that Ukraine is prepared to hold elections, provided that international partners can guarantee the country's security during the process. His comments come after former US President Donald Trump claimed that Kyiv was using the ongoing war as an excuse to delay elections. This exchange highlights the political tensions surrounding Ukraine’s path to governance amid conflict.</p>
<h2>Health Concerns from Fertility Practices</h2>
<p>A concerning medical issue has emerged involving a sperm donor who carried a gene linked to cancer. Nearly 200 children were conceived using his sperm, and some of these children have already died. Only a small portion of those who inherit the genetic mutation are expected to avoid developing cancer over their lifetimes. This case raises questions about genetic screening and safety in fertility treatments.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Morocco, a tragic building collapse in the city of Fez resulted in at least 22 deaths. The collapse involved two four-storey buildings housing eight families. Authorities are responding to the incident and assessing the situation for survivors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the Taliban have issued warnings to individuals who wore clothing associated with the TV show "Peaky Blinders," calling the outfits "un-Islamic" and incompatible with Afghan and Islamic values. This warning reflects ongoing tight controls over cultural expression under Taliban rule.</p>
<h2>Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony Update</h2>
<p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader who is currently in hiding, is reportedly on her way to Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. Her daughter accepted the award on her behalf, highlighting the political challenges Machado faces while being recognized internationally for her efforts.</p>
