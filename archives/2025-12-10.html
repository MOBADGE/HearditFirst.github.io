    <h2>US Considers Social Media History for Foreign Tourists</h2>
<p>The United States is planning to require some foreign tourists, including those from the UK who currently can enter without a visa using a form, to submit a five-year history of their social media activity before being allowed entry. This proposed change aims to enhance security screening but could affect travelers who benefit from the visa waiver program. The impact and details of the plan are still being discussed.</p>
<h2>European Leaders Discuss Ukraine After Trump Call</h2>
<p>Leaders from Britain, France, and Germany described the situation in Ukraine as being at a "critical moment." They made the remarks following a joint phone call with Donald Trump, emphasizing ongoing "intensive work" to address the conflict. The discussions suggest coordinated European efforts continue as tensions in Ukraine remain high.</p>
<h2>Iceland Joins Eurovision Boycott</h2>
<p>Iceland has announced it will boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, joining Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands in this decision. The reasons behind the boycott were not specified in detail, but the growing number of countries withdrawing may affect the contest's future participation and dynamics.</p>
<h2>Epstein Grand Jury Records to Be Released</h2>
<p>A federal judge ruled that the grand jury records from the 2019 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein can be publicly released. This decision follows a new law passed by Congress last month, which allows certain previously sealed materials to be made available. The release is expected to shed more light on the case and its proceedings.</p>
<h2>Taliban Warn Against 'Un-Islamic' Clothing</h2>
<p>The Taliban have issued a warning to Afghans, particularly targeting those seen wearing clothing inspired by the TV show Peaky Blinders. A Taliban spokesman told the BBC that such outfits conflict with Afghan and Islamic values. This warning underscores ongoing cultural restrictions imposed by the group.</p>
<h2>Other International Highlights</h2>
<p>Italy’s cooking traditions have been added to UNESCO’s cultural heritage list, along with cultural practices from Egypt, Iceland, Cuba, and Albania. Meanwhile, in West Africa, a coup attempt in Benin was stopped with help from Nigerian warplanes, and the coup leader is reported to be hiding in neighboring Togo. In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado’s daughter accepted a Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf, with Machado reportedly traveling to Oslo.</p>
<p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, rebels have reportedly entered the key city of Uvira despite a recent peace agreement brokered with Donald Trump, causing fear among residents due to heavy fighting. Lastly, in Morocco, two residential buildings collapsed in Fez, killing at least 22 people from eight families. Rescue efforts are likely ongoing.</p>
