    <h2>Health and Ethics: Cancer-Causing Gene in Donor Sperm Affects Nearly 200 Children</h2>
<p>Almost 200 children were conceived using sperm from a donor carrying a gene that significantly increases cancer risk. Some of these children have already died, and only a minority who inherit the mutation are expected to escape cancer during their lifetimes. This case raises serious ethical and medical questions about genetic screening in sperm donation and highlights the potential long-term consequences for families affected by inherited cancer risks.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and Security Guarantees Ahead of Possible Elections</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s leader expressed readiness to hold elections if international partners can guarantee security during the process. This statement came after former US President Donald Trump claimed that Kyiv was using the ongoing war to delay elections. The situation underscores ongoing tensions related to the conflict in Ukraine and the complexities of maintaining democratic processes during wartime.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulations in Australia: Under-16s Locked Out</h2>
<p>Australia has implemented a new, world-first law requiring technology platforms to block Australians under 16 years old from holding social media accounts. This legislation aims to protect children from potential harms associated with social media use. The move puts pressure on tech companies to enforce age restrictions more strictly and may influence policies in other countries considering similar protections for young users.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Unrest: Violence in DR Congo and Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Despite a peace agreement brokered in part by Donald Trump, rebel forces continue to target areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo, specifically around the city of Uvira. Schools and shops remain closed amid fears that rebels may have seized some administrative buildings, raising concerns about stability and civilian safety in the region.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, clashes persist between Thailand and Cambodia. Trump has announced plans to intervene and "make a phone call" to help end the fighting, reflecting ongoing efforts to manage regional conflicts through diplomatic channels.</p>
<h2>Political Turmoil in Brazil and Global Tensions</h2>
<p>Brazil’s Congress descended into chaos as lawmakers scuffled during a vote related to efforts to reduce the jail sentence of former president Jair Bolsonaro. The disorder highlights deep political divisions within the country and ongoing debate over Bolsonaro's legal status.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, South Korea protested the entry of Chinese and Russian warplanes into its airspace, promising an active response to these incursions. These developments come amid growing global geopolitical tensions, with the US also warning Europe about potential threats to its stability, a view shared largely by a French far-right leader.</p>
<h2>In Memoriam: Elephant Conservationist Iain Douglas-Hamilton Passes Away</h2>
<p>Iain Douglas-Hamilton, an influential elephant conservationist whose research helped ban the international ivory trade and protect elephants from poachers, has died at age 83. His work has had a lasting impact on global conservation efforts and the protection of endangered species.</p>
