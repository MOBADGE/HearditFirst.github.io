    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Travel and Security Measures</h2>
<p>The United States is considering a new entry requirement that would ask some foreign tourists to provide their social media history for the past five years before being allowed into the country. This plan would affect visitors from nations, including the UK, whose citizens currently can enter the US by filling out a simple form instead of obtaining a visa. The move aims to enhance security but could also add extra steps and scrutiny for travelers. How this policy might impact travel patterns or diplomatic relations remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>A federal judge has ruled that grand jury records from the 2019 Jeffrey Epstein investigation can be made public, citing a new law passed by Congress last month that allows such disclosures. This decision could bring more transparency to the case and potentially reveal new details about the investigation.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that the country is prepared to hold elections if international partners can guarantee security. This comes after US President Donald Trump accused Kyiv of "using war" as an excuse to delay elections. The stance of Ukraine highlights ongoing concerns about stability and democratic processes amid conflict.</p>
<p>Separately, a US judge has blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles that was ordered in June under President Trump. The judge directed that control over the troops be returned to California’s governor, underscoring ongoing tensions over federal and state authority in security matters.</p>
<h2>International Conflicts and Crises</h2>
<p>Reports indicate that rebels have entered the key city of Uvira in the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite a peace deal brokered with the involvement of Donald Trump. Residents describe heavy artillery fire and gun battles in the area, which serves as an important gateway to neighboring Burundi. This renewed violence threatens regional stability and calls into question the effectiveness of recent peace efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the Taliban have issued warnings to individuals who wore clothing inspired by the TV show "Peaky Blinders," saying their style conflicts with Afghan and Islamic values. This reflects the continued cultural control the Taliban exercise in the country.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Tragedies</h2>
<p>In Morocco, at least 22 people have died following the collapse of two four-storey buildings in the city of Fez. These buildings housed eight families, according to state media, highlighting concerns about building safety and infrastructure in the area.</p>
<p>In a concerning health development, almost 200 children have been conceived using sperm from a donor who carried a gene linked to cancer. Some of these children have already died, and the inherited mutation means only a small number will remain free of cancer throughout their lives. This case raises questions about genetic screening and donor information transparency.</p>
<h2>Cultural Events and Recognitions</h2>
<p>Iceland has joined Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands in boycotting the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. The reasons behind these coordinated boycotts have not been detailed but suggest growing tensions or disagreements related to the event.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has been living in hiding, had her daughter accept a Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Machado is reportedly traveling to Oslo, signaling a significant moment for Venezuela’s opposition amid ongoing political challenges.</p>
