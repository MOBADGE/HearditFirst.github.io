    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Diplomacy and Security</h2>
<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has been living in hiding, is reportedly traveling to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Her recognition highlights ongoing political tensions in Venezuela. Meanwhile, US military jets have been spotted near Maracaibo, Venezuela’s second-largest city, signaling increased vigilance in the Gulf of Venezuela amid rising regional tensions.</p>
<p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite a peace deal brokered during the Trump administration, rebel groups have attacked the key city of Uvira. The unrest has led to school and shop closures as rebels reportedly seized some administrative buildings, raising concerns about the stability and security situation there.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Elections and International Relations</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, has declared the country ready to hold elections, provided international partners can guarantee security during the process. This statement comes in response to former US President Donald Trump’s claim that Ukraine is using the ongoing war as a pretext to delay elections. The situation underscores continuing geopolitical complexities as Ukraine navigates conflict and diplomatic pressures.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy Update</h2>
<p>The US government is considering a new policy that would require foreign tourists from certain countries, including the UK, to submit five years’ worth of social media history before entering the country. This plan is aimed at enhancing security screening for travelers who currently qualify for visa exemptions and can fill out an electronic form instead.</p>
<h2>Health and Science</h2>
<p>A troubling genetic health issue has emerged involving a sperm donor carrying a cancer-causing gene. Nearly 200 children have been conceived using this donor’s sperm. Some of these children have already died, and a majority who inherit the mutation face a significant lifetime risk of developing cancer. This case raises critical questions about genetic screening and donor safety in reproductive medicine.</p>
<h2>Domestic News Highlights</h2>
<p>In Morocco’s city of Fez, two four-storey buildings collapsed, killing at least 22 people. The buildings housed eight families, making the disaster particularly tragic for the community. Rescue and recovery efforts are ongoing.</p>
<p>In South Africa, Brumelda Zuma, daughter of a former president, has been sworn in as a member of parliament. She is taking her seat on behalf of her father’s political party following her half-sister’s resignation, continuing her family’s involvement in politics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the Taliban have issued warnings to a group of friends who wore clothing inspired by the TV show Peaky Blinders. Officials said the outfits were considered “in conflict with Afghan and Islamic values,” reflecting ongoing cultural tensions under Taliban rule.</p>
<h2>European Security Perspectives</h2>
<p>A French far-right political leader expressed agreement with warnings issued in the recent US National Security Strategy. The US document suggests Europe is facing “civilisational erasure,” a view that the French figure says he shares for the most part. This adds to debates in Europe about security challenges and ideological shifts on the continent.</p>
