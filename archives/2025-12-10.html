    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in several regions around the world. In the Gulf of Venezuela, US F/A-18 Super Hornet jets have been tracked circling near Maracaibo, Venezuela’s second-largest city. This military activity comes amid broader geopolitical concerns in the region. Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, gunfire erupted as rebels targeted the city of Uvira. Despite a recent peace deal brokered with the involvement of former US President Donald Trump, fears persist as schools and shops remain closed and rebels may have seized administrative buildings.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban issued warnings to a group of young people for wearing clothing from the TV show Peaky Blinders, saying such outfits are “in conflict with Afghan and Islamic values.” This highlights ongoing cultural and ideological tensions under Taliban rule.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>In South Africa, Brumelda Zuma, daughter of a former president, has been sworn in as a member of parliament. She takes the seat after her half-sister resigned and will represent their father's political party. The move indicates continuity within the party’s parliamentary representation.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country is prepared to hold elections if international partners can guarantee security. This statement comes after former US President Donald Trump accused Ukraine of using the ongoing war as a reason to delay elections. Zelensky’s comments underline the ongoing challenge of balancing democratic processes with national security in a conflict zone.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Social Issues</h2>
<p>A troubling genetic health issue has come to light involving nearly 200 children conceived using sperm from a donor carrying a cancer-causing gene mutation. Some of these children have already died, and medical experts warn only a small number may avoid developing cancer during their lifetimes. This case raises important questions about donor screening and genetic counseling.</p>
<p>Tragically, at least 22 people have died following the collapse of two four-storey buildings in the Moroccan city of Fez. The buildings housed eight families, and investigations into the cause are ongoing.</p>
<h2>Travel and Security Screening</h2>
<p>The United States is considering a new security measure that would require some foreign tourists, including travelers from visa waiver countries like the UK, to provide five years of social media history before being allowed entry. This policy is intended to enhance national security but could impact how easily visitors can travel to the US.</p>
<h2>Honors and Recognition</h2>
<p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader who is reportedly living in hiding due to political pressures, is reportedly safe and en route to Oslo to receive an award on behalf of a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Her travel signifies the continuing international recognition of efforts related to democracy and human rights in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>European Security Concerns</h2>
<p>A French far-right political figure commented that he largely agrees with recent US warnings about European security, referring to a new US National Security Strategy document that describes Europe as facing a risk of “civilisational erasure.” This reflects ongoing debates about threats to European stability and identity in the context of global geopolitics.</p>
