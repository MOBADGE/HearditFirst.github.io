    <h2>Security and Travel</h2>
<p>The US is considering a new measure that would require foreign tourists from certain countries, including the UK, to provide a five-year history of their social media activity before entering the country. This rule would target visitors who currently qualify to travel under programs allowing entry with just a form instead of a visa. The change aims to enhance screening but could affect the travel experience and privacy expectations for tourists.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and European Diplomacy</h2>
<p>European leaders from Britain, France, and Germany emphasized that Ukraine remains at a critical juncture amid ongoing conflict. They released a statement following a joint phone call with Donald Trump, describing ongoing work as "intensive" to address the situation. This signals continued diplomatic efforts to support Ukraine and seek solutions despite complex challenges.</p>
<h2>International Culture and Politics</h2>
<p>Iceland has announced it will join Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands in boycotting the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. The reasons for the boycott have not been detailed but reflect growing political tensions affecting international cultural events. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, María Corina Machado, an opposition leader who has been hiding, is reportedly traveling to Oslo after her daughter accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf.  
 
### Legal and Justice Developments</p>
<p>A federal judge ruled that grand jury materials from the 2019 Jeffrey Epstein investigation can be publicly released. This decision is based on a new law that Congress passed last month allowing certain investigation records to be unsealed. The judge’s ruling could shed new light on the case and ongoing inquiries related to Epstein.</p>
<h2>Regional Conflicts and Security</h2>
<p>In Africa, several security developments have unfolded. A coup attempt in Benin was foiled after Nigerian forces used warplanes to dislodge mutineers occupying national television offices. However, unrest continues in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where rebels reportedly entered the strategic city of Uvira despite a peace deal brokered under Donald Trump. Local residents report heavy fighting and artillery in the area, highlighting ongoing instability.</p>
<h2>Public Safety</h2>
<p>In Morocco, a tragic building collapse in Fez resulted in at least 22 deaths. The two four-storey buildings that fell housed eight families, according to state media. Rescue operations are likely ongoing, and this event raises concerns over building safety standards in the region.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This roundup highlights several key global issues today, including travel security policies, diplomatic efforts in Ukraine, cultural boycotts, judicial transparency, and ongoing conflicts in Africa, alongside a major accident affecting civilian lives in Morocco.</p>
