    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Several significant developments have occurred around the world related to conflict and political stability. In Central Africa, rebels have reportedly entered the key city of Uvira in the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite a recent peace agreement brokered by Donald Trump. Residents report heavy artillery and gunfire, raising concerns about renewed violence in the region.</p>
<p>In West Africa, a coup attempt in Benin was thwarted after Nigerian warplanes intervened to remove mutineers from state television offices. The leader of this coup plot is now believed to be hiding in neighboring Togo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions are rising near Venezuela as U.S. jets, specifically F/A-18 Super Hornets, have been observed circling the Gulf of Venezuela near Maracaibo, the country's second-largest city. This increased military presence adds to concerns about potential regional instability.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and European Diplomacy</h2>
<p>European leaders from Britain, France, and Germany have emphasized that Ukraine is at a "critical moment" in its ongoing situation. This statement followed a joint phone call with Donald Trump, highlighting ongoing intensive diplomatic efforts. These remarks suggest continued coordination among key Western powers as they navigate the complex issues facing Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Cultural Recognitions by UNESCO</h2>
<p>UNESCO has added several cultural traditions to its list of intangible cultural heritage. Notably, Italian cooking has been officially recognized, underscoring the global value placed on Italy’s culinary traditions. Other new additions include an Egyptian snack, Icelandic pool culture, Cuban music, and Albanian lahuta music. These designations aim to preserve and promote diverse cultural expressions worldwide.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>A federal judge has ruled that grand jury records from a 2019 case involving Jeffrey Epstein can be released to the public. This decision follows a recent change in U.S. law passed by Congress last month, which allows for greater transparency in such cases. The release of these materials could have implications for ongoing investigations and public understanding of the case.</p>
<p>Additionally, the U.S. government is considering a proposal that would require some foreign tourists, including those from the United Kingdom who typically do not need visas, to submit up to five years of social media history before entering the country. If implemented, this would represent a significant expansion of entry screening procedures and could impact travel and tourism.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Issues in Afghanistan</h2>
<p>The Taliban have issued warnings to Afghan citizens who wore clothing inspired by the British television series "Peaky Blinders," describing the outfits as "un-Islamic" and at odds with Afghan and Islamic values. This incident reflects ongoing cultural enforcement by the Taliban regime and highlights restrictions on personal expression in Afghanistan.</p>
