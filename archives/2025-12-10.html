    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>Health and Genetics</h2>
<p>Nearly 200 children were conceived using sperm from a donor carrying a cancer-causing gene, raising serious health concerns. Some of these children have already died, and many who inherit the mutation face a high risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes. Only a small portion of those with the genetic mutation are expected to avoid cancer. This situation highlights important issues about screening and safety in sperm donation, and it may prompt a review of current practices to prevent similar cases in the future.</p>
<h2>International Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The United States has urged Thailand and Cambodia to stop ongoing clashes. Donald Trump, who previously helped broker a ceasefire between the two countries, announced plans to make a phone call to attempt to halt the fighting. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed readiness to hold elections if international partners can guarantee security. Zelensky made these remarks as Donald Trump repeated claims that Ukraine was using the conflict to avoid holding elections, underscoring ongoing tensions and the complex geopolitical challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in Brazil</h2>
<p>Chaos erupted in the Brazilian Congress during a contentious vote related to efforts to reduce the prison sentence of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Physical scuffles broke out among lawmakers, reflecting deep political divisions in the country. The incident underscores turbulent political dynamics in Brazil as different factions vie for influence in the wake of Bolsonaro's presidency and ongoing debates over justice and accountability.</p>
<h2>Social Media Restrictions in Australia</h2>
<p>Millions of Australian teenagers will soon be banned from using social media, a move that has sparked debate across the country. Critics argue that the ban is insulting to young people, suggesting they are incapable of managing social media responsibly. Supporters may believe the restrictions protect teens from harmful online content. This significant step will reshape social media use among young Australians and could have wider implications for digital platforms and youth culture.</p>
<h2>Notable Death in Conservation</h2>
<p>Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a pioneering conservationist known for his groundbreaking work with elephants, died at the age of 83. His research played a key role in efforts to ban the international ivory trade and protect elephants from poaching. Douglas-Hamilton's contributions have had a lasting impact on wildlife conservation, helping to shape global policies aimed at preserving endangered species.</p>
<h2>Economy and Public Sentiment in the US</h2>
<p>Donald Trump promoted an optimistic message about the US economy, emphasizing his focus on "making America affordable again." This comes amid growing public concern over the rising cost of living, which has become a significant issue for voters. The president's messaging aims to address economic anxieties and could influence how economic policies are debated moving forward.</p>
