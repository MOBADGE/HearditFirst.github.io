    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>Health and Science</h2>
<p>Nearly 200 children were conceived using sperm from a donor who carried a gene associated with a high risk of cancer. Some of these children have already died, while others who inherited the mutation face a significant chance of developing cancer in their lifetimes. This situation raises serious concerns about genetic screening and donor regulations to prevent similar occurrences in the future.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and International Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine's leader stated that the country is prepared to hold elections if international partners can guarantee security during the process. This statement comes amid repeated allegations from US President Donald Trump, who accused Kyiv of using the ongoing war as a reason to avoid elections. Security assurance from allies remains a critical factor for Ukraine’s political plans.</p>
<h2>International Travel and Security Measures</h2>
<p>The US government is considering a new policy that would require foreign tourists from certain countries, including the UK, to provide their social media histories from the past five years before being allowed entry. This measure aims to enhance national security but could affect travel ease for many visitors who currently benefit from visa-waiver programs.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Australia</h2>
<p>Australia has implemented a pioneering law that bans people under the age of 16 from having accounts on social media platforms. The new rule places responsibility on technology companies to enforce age restrictions, marking the first law of its kind worldwide. This move is designed to protect young people from potential online harms.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo</h2>
<p>Despite a peace deal facilitated by Donald Trump, armed rebels attacked the city of Uvira in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The violence has led to the closure of schools and shops amid fears that rebels have taken control of some administrative buildings. This ongoing conflict underscores the fragility of peace efforts in the region.</p>
<h2>Disaster in Morocco</h2>
<p>At least 22 people were killed when two four-storey buildings collapsed in the city of Fez, Morocco. The buildings housed eight families, according to state media. Rescue and recovery operations are likely underway, and the incident highlights concerns about building safety standards in the area.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Elon Musk reflected on his involvement with Dogecoin, describing it as "somewhat successful" but expressed that he would not repeat the experience. He also mentioned that instead of working in government efficiency, he could have focused more on his private companies.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump emphasized his intention to address the rising cost of living in America, stating a commitment to "making America affordable again" as economic concerns become a key topic in his campaign.</p>
<p>Finally, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has been living in hiding, is reportedly safe and en route to Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize celebrations, although she will not attend the awards ceremony itself.</p>
