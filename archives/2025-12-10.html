    <h2>US Social Media Checks for Foreign Tourists Proposed</h2>
<p>The US government is considering a new requirement for some foreign tourists, including those from the UK, to provide five years of social media history before entering the country. This would apply to travelers eligible to fill out a form instead of obtaining a visa. The policy aims to enhance security checks, although details on implementation and potential impacts are still evolving.</p>
<h2>European Leaders Focus on Ukraine Amid Ongoing Conflict</h2>
<p>Leaders from Britain, France, and Germany described the situation in Ukraine as "critical" following a joint phone call with former US President Donald Trump. The group emphasized ongoing intensive work to develop a plan for the region. The statement highlights continued international concern and coordination regarding the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Eurovision Boycott Expands to Iceland</h2>
<p>Iceland has joined Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands in deciding to boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. The reasons behind these boycotts were not detailed, but the growing number of countries opting out suggests challenges or disputes surrounding the event. The boycott could impact the contest’s diversity and popularity next year.</p>
<h2>Grand Jury Records from Epstein Case to Be Released</h2>
<p>A federal judge authorized the release of grand jury records related to the 2019 Jeffrey Epstein investigation. This decision was made possible by a new law passed by Congress last month, which allows certain investigation materials to be unsealed. The release may shed light on details from the high-profile case that have remained confidential.</p>
<h2>Taliban Criticize Afghans for Wearing 'Un-Islamic' Fashion</h2>
<p>The Taliban have warned several young Afghans for wearing clothing inspired by the TV show “Peaky Blinders,” calling the fashion choices "in conflict with Afghan and Islamic values." This reflects ongoing strict social controls enforced by the Taliban regime regarding dress and cultural expression in Afghanistan.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Headlines</h2>
<p>- Italian cooking has been recognized by UNESCO as part of the cultural heritage of humanity, alongside Egyptian snacks, Icelandic pool culture, Cuban music, and Albanian lahuta music.</p>
<p>- In West Africa, the leader of a foiled coup attempt in Benin is reportedly hiding in neighboring Togo. The coup was stopped after Nigerian forces intervened.</p>
<p>- In the Democratic Republic of Congo, rebels have reportedly entered the key city of Uvira, prompting fear among residents despite an existing peace agreement.</p>
