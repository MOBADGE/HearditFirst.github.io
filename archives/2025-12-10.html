    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Travel Security</h2>
<p>The United States is considering a new rule that would require some foreign tourists, including those from visa-exempt countries like the UK, to provide five years of social media history before being allowed entry. This would affect people currently able to fill out an online form instead of applying for a visa. The plan aims to enhance security checks but has raised questions about privacy and the impact on travel.</p>
<h2>European Leaders Discuss Ukraine</h2>
<p>Britain, France, and Germany have emphasized that Ukraine is at a "critical moment" following a joint phone call with Donald Trump. The European leaders said work on a plan to support Ukraine is continuing intensively. This statement comes amid ongoing efforts to address the challenges facing Ukraine, underscoring the importance of international collaboration in the region's crisis.</p>
<h2>Eurovision Boycott Expands</h2>
<p>Iceland has become the fifth country to announce a boycott of the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. It joins Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands in this decision. While specific reasons for the boycott were not detailed in the reports, the growing list of countries abstaining signals significant discontent with the event or its organization that could affect its future.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments on Epstein Case</h2>
<p>A federal judge has ruled that grand jury materials from a 2019 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein can be unsealed. This decision is based on a recent change in law passed by Congress last month. The release of these records may provide new insights into the case and is expected to attract public and legal interest.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>At least 22 people have died in Morocco after two four-story buildings collapsed in the city of Fez. The buildings housed eight families, and state media reported on the tragedy. In West Africa, the leader of a coup plot in Benin is reportedly hiding in Togo after Nigerian forces helped thwart the attempt. Meanwhile, the daughter of Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf; Machado is currently in hiding but is reportedly traveling to Oslo.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban have warned friends who wore "un-Islamic" clothing inspired by the TV show Peaky Blinders, stating their outfits conflict with Afghan and Islamic values. Additionally, Italian cooking, along with several other cultural traditions around the world such as an Egyptian snack and Cuban music, have been recognized by UNESCO as cultural heritage, highlighting global efforts to preserve diverse traditions.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security in Africa</h2>
<p>Reports indicate that rebels have entered the key eastern Congolese city of Uvira, despite a peace deal brokered with the involvement of Donald Trump. Residents describe heavy artillery and gunfire, raising concerns about stability in the region. This development points to ongoing challenges in securing lasting peace in parts of Central Africa.</p>
