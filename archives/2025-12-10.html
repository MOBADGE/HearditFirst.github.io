    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Travel Security</h2>
<p>The United States is considering a new security measure that would require some foreign tourists to provide a five-year history of their social media activity before being allowed entry. This plan would affect travellers from countries like the UK who currently qualify to enter the US by filling out a form instead of obtaining a visa. The measure is part of ongoing efforts to enhance border security and better assess potential risks posed by visitors.</p>
<h2>European Diplomatic Efforts on Ukraine</h2>
<p>Leaders from Britain, France, and Germany have stressed Ukraine is at a critical moment, following a recent joint call with Donald Trump. They described ongoing work in managing the situation there as "intensive." The discussions indicate that European leaders remain closely engaged with various international partners to navigate the complex challenges Ukraine faces, though specific next steps have not yet been detailed.</p>
<h2>Cultural Boycotts and Recognition</h2>
<p>Iceland has joined several European countries—Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands—in deciding to boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. The reasons for the boycott were not provided in the reports but reflect a broader pattern of protest among some nations.</p>
<p>In contrast, Italian cooking has received international recognition as a Unesco cultural heritage, highlighting the global appreciation for Italy’s culinary traditions. Alongside this, cultural practices such as an Egyptian snack, Icelandic pool culture, Cuban music, and Albanian lahuta music were also added to the list, showcasing diverse cultural contributions worldwide.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in High-Profile Case</h2>
<p>A federal judge has ruled that grand jury records from a 2019 investigation related to Jeffrey Epstein can be released. The decision follows the passage of a new law by Congress last month, which provides for greater transparency in such cases. The unsealing of these materials could shed new light on aspects of the investigation that have remained confidential.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security Updates</h2>
<p>In Africa, reports indicate that rebels have entered Uvira, a key city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite a peace agreement that involved Donald Trump. Residents have described heavy artillery fire and gunfire in the area, raising concerns about escalating violence.</p>
<p>Separately, a coup plot in Benin was foiled with the help of Nigerian military intervention, which included warplanes dislodging mutineers from state TV offices. The leader of the coup plot is reportedly hiding in neighboring Togo. These incidents underscore ongoing instability and security challenges in parts of West and Central Africa.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban have warned individuals who wore clothing inspired by the TV show Peaky Blinders, saying such outfits conflict with Afghan and Islamic values. This reflects the group’s continued enforcement of strict social codes.</p>
<p>Also, in the US, a judge blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, ordering command to be returned to California’s governor. These troops were initially deployed in June, and their control is now subject to legal review.</p>
<p>Finally, in Norway, the daughter of Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Machado, who is reportedly in hiding, is reportedly en route to Oslo to receive the award personally.</p>
