    <h2>Health and Ethics: Donor Sperm with Cancer Risk Used to Conceive Nearly 200 Children</h2>
<p>A troubling revelation has emerged that sperm from a donor carrying a cancer-causing gene was used to conceive almost 200 children. Some of these children have sadly already died due to the inherited mutation. Not everyone who inherits the gene will develop cancer, but only a minority are expected to escape the disease in their lifetimes. This situation raises serious ethical and medical concerns about genetic screening and donor oversight in fertility treatments.</p>
<h2>International Politics: Ukraine Ready for Elections with Security Assurances</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that Ukraine is prepared to hold elections if its international partners can guarantee the country’s security. His remarks come amid repeated claims from US President Donald Trump that Kyiv is using the ongoing war as a pretext to avoid elections. Zelensky’s statement signals a willingness to move forward politically, conditional on stable security guarantees.</p>
<h2>Technology Regulation: Australia Bans Under-16s from Social Media</h2>
<p>Australia has implemented the world’s first law requiring technology platforms to ensure that citizens under the age of 16 cannot hold accounts on social media apps. This move aims to protect younger users from potential harms associated with online platforms. As governments increasingly scrutinize social media’s impact on youth, Australia’s legislation may set a precedent for stricter age verification worldwide.</p>
<h2>Global Security: South Korea Protests Chinese and Russian Military Flights</h2>
<p>South Korea has protested the entry of Chinese and Russian warplanes into its airspace, vowing to “actively respond” to such incursions in its air defense identification zone. This development underscores rising tensions in the region, as neighboring powers increase their military activities. How Seoul manages these challenges could influence broader stability in East Asia.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest: Chaos in Brazil’s Congress over Bolsonaro’s Sentence Reduction</h2>
<p>The Brazilian Congress experienced scuffles during a contentious vote related to attempts to reduce the jail sentence of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The disorder highlights ongoing political divisions in Brazil linked to Bolsonaro’s legal troubles and the broader debate over justice and governance. The outcome of this vote could have significant implications for Brazil’s political landscape.</p>
<h2>Remembering a Conservation Pioneer: Iain Douglas-Hamilton Passes Away</h2>
<p>Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a pioneering elephant conservationist, has died at the age of 83. His groundbreaking field research played a crucial role in achieving the international ban on ivory trade and protecting elephants from poachers. His legacy continues to influence global wildlife preservation efforts and highlights the impact one individual can have on conservation policy.</p>
