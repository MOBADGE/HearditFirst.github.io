    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 10, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics and Conflicts</h2>
<p>European leaders from Britain, France, and Germany emphasized that Ukraine is at a "critical moment" following a joint call with Donald Trump. They indicated that work on a plan regarding Ukraine is ongoing, highlighting the importance of international coordination during this period of tension.</p>
<p>In Africa, a coup attempt in Benin was thwarted with assistance from Nigeria, which deployed warplanes to remove mutineers who had taken over state TV offices. An official reported that the leader behind the plot is now hiding in Togo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite a recent peace deal associated with Donald Trump, rebels have reportedly entered the city of Uvira near Burundi. Locals have described heavy artillery and gunfire in the city, marking escalating conflict.</p>
<h2>US Immigration and Security Measures</h2>
<p>The United States is considering a new security proposal that would require foreign tourists from certain countries, such as the UK, to provide five years of social media history when applying for entry. This measure would affect travelers who currently can apply without a visa through an electronic form, potentially adding new layers of scrutiny in the visa process.</p>
<h2>Cultural Recognition and International Events</h2>
<p>Italy’s cooking traditions have been officially recognized as part of UNESCO’s cultural heritage, joining other new inclusions such as an Egyptian snack, Icelandic swimming pool culture, Cuban music, and the Albanian lahuta musical tradition. This recognition highlights the global value of diverse cultural expressions.</p>
<p>In entertainment news, Iceland announced it will boycott the Eurovision Song Contest in 2026. Iceland joins Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands in this decision, signaling a growing movement among some countries to distance themselves from the event.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in the US</h2>
<p>A federal judge ruled that grand jury records from the 2019 investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein can be released to the public. This decision follows a new law passed by the US Congress last month, which allows for the unsealing of these materials and may provide greater transparency about the investigation.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban issued warnings to a group of friends for wearing clothing inspired by the TV show "Peaky Blinders," stating that their outfits conflict with Afghan and Islamic values. This incident reflects ongoing strict enforcement of cultural and religious norms by the Taliban.</p>
<p>In Morocco, two four-storey buildings collapsed in the city of Fez, killing at least 22 people. The buildings housed eight families, according to state media, prompting concerns over building safety and emergency response capabilities in the area.</p>
<h2>Nobel Peace Prize Update</h2>
<p>The daughter of Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Machado, who lives in hiding, is reportedly traveling to Oslo to mark the occasion, drawing international attention to her political situation in Venezuela.</p>
