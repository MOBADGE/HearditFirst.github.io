    <h2>International Travel and Security Measures</h2>
<p>The United States is considering a new policy that would require foreign tourists, including those from visa-exempt countries like the UK, to provide a five-year history of their social media activity before entry. This would affect visitors who currently fill out a travel authorization form instead of obtaining a visa. The proposal aims to enhance security screening for travelers but may raise privacy concerns and could impact tourism and travel processes.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>European leaders from Britain, France, and Germany have described the situation in Ukraine as a "critical moment" following a recent joint phone call with Donald Trump. They emphasize that intensive diplomatic and political efforts are continuing to address the crisis. The leaders’ collaboration highlights the ongoing international engagement with the conflict, although details of next steps have not been disclosed.</p>
<h2>Cultural Boycotts Impacting Eurovision</h2>
<p>Iceland has announced it will join Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands in boycotting the Eurovision Song Contest set for 2026. This marks the fifth country to withdraw from the event, signaling political or other disputes that are influencing participation in the popular European cultural competition. The broader implications for Eurovision remain to be seen as organizers may need to respond to these multiple withdrawals.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in Jeffrey Epstein Case</h2>
<p>A federal judge has ruled that grand jury records from the 2019 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein can be released. This decision follows a new law passed by the US Congress last month that allows certain previously confidential materials to be unsealed. The release could provide greater public insight into the case and its proceedings, potentially affecting ongoing discussions around justice and accountability.</p>
<h2>Violence and Unrest in Africa</h2>
<p>Several African countries are experiencing significant unrest. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, rebels reportedly entered the key city of Uvira despite a peace deal brokered by Donald Trump. Residents have reported heavy artillery and gunfire, raising concerns about regional security. Additionally, a coup attempt in Benin was thwarted after Nigerian air forces intervened to remove mutineers from state television offices. The coup leader is said to be hiding in neighbouring Togo.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Morocco, at least 22 people died when two four-storey buildings collapsed in the city of Fez. The buildings housed eight families, and the cause of the collapse has not been detailed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a US judge ordered the return of control over National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles back to California’s governor. These troops had been deployed in June, and the decision reflects legal and political debates over military presence in civilian areas.</p>
<p>Separately, the Taliban have issued warnings to Afghans who wore clothing inspired by the TV series Peaky Blinders, saying such outfits conflict with Afghan and Islamic values.</p>
<p>In Norway, the daughter of Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Machado, who is reportedly living in hiding, is on her way to Oslo for the ceremony.</p>
