    <h2>Ukraine Peace Proposal</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has outlined a new peace plan focusing on the conflict in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. A notable element of the proposal includes the establishment of a "free economic zone" as a potential solution. Zelensky's plan also involves creating demilitarised zones aimed at reducing violence. This approach seeks to address the long-standing tensions in the area, potentially paving the way for ceasefire and economic cooperation.</p>
<h2>New Developments in Epstein Case</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice announced the discovery of around one million additional documents that may be linked to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The agency indicated that reviewing this vast amount of new material could delay the scheduled release of documents by several weeks. Among the previously released files, notable communications and mentions, including some involving President Donald Trump, have already emerged, highlighting ongoing public and legal interest in the case.</p>
<h2>Security Incidents in Moscow and Nigeria</h2>
<p>Two police officers were killed in Moscow when a device exploded after they approached a suspicious individual. Officials described the event as a targeted attack, underscoring ongoing security challenges in the Russian capital. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, an explosion struck a mosque filled with worshippers gathered for evening prayers. Eyewitnesses reported the blast but further details surrounding the cause and casualties remain limited, indicating ongoing investigations.</p>
<h2>International Disputes and Legal Actions</h2>
<p>Algerian lawmakers unanimously passed a new law declaring France's colonisation of Algeria a crime. The legislation calls for official apologies and reparations from France, underscoring historical grievances that continue to affect relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, in the United States, Representative Joyce Beatty has filed a lawsuit challenging the renaming of the Kennedy Center. Beatty argues that removing former President Trump's name from the venue requires an act of Congress and that the current change is therefore unlawful.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Tensions remain between the US and Venezuela following the seizure of two Venezuelan oil tankers by US authorities. Venezuela described the action as "extortion," prompting an emergency UN Security Council meeting to discuss the matter. In another incident in the US, two people died following explosions and a fire at a nursing home in Pennsylvania. Investigators are exploring the possibility that a gas leak caused the blasts, which resulted in a partial collapse of the building.</p>
<h2>US Visa Restrictions</h2>
<p>Five individuals involved in UK social media campaigns calling for increased technology regulation were denied US visas under the Trump administration. The visa ban reflects ongoing tensions over technology policy and regulatory issues between the US and international activists focused on digital platforms.</p>
