    <h2>Ukraine Peace Plan and Border Tensions</h2>
<p>Ukraine's president has indicated a new peace plan includes the possibility of withdrawing from parts of the eastern Donbas region. One option being considered is establishing a "free economic zone" there. Meanwhile, in the Sumy region near the Russian border, Ukraine is attempting to evacuate civilians amid ongoing conflict, though many residents are reluctant to leave. Some border villagers have reportedly been abducted and taken to Russia, adding to concerns about the humanitarian situation.</p>
<h2>Venezuela and US Dispute at the UN</h2>
<p>Venezuela has accused the United States of "extortion" following the seizure of two Venezuelan oil tankers by US authorities. This incident prompted an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation. The dispute highlights continuing tensions over economic and political issues between the two countries.</p>
<h2>US Denies Visas Over Social Media Regulations</h2>
<p>The United States government has denied visas to Thierry Breton, the former European Union commissioner responsible for technology regulation, among others. Breton criticized the move as part of a "witch hunt." This development reflects ongoing friction over differing approaches to overseeing social media and digital technologies.</p>
<h2>Tragic Explosion in Pennsylvania Nursing Home</h2>
<p>At least two people have died following an explosion at a nursing home in Pennsylvania. Rescue crews have saved several people from the partially collapsed building, but five individuals remain unaccounted for. Officials are continuing search and rescue efforts amid concerns about additional casualties.</p>
<h2>Notable Developments in Libya and Brazil</h2>
<p>In Libya, the country's army chief, Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad, was killed in an air crash in Turkey after a jet lost contact shortly after takeoff from Ankara. This is a significant loss for the Libyan military.</p>
<p>In Brazil, the Supreme Court has allowed former president Jair Bolsonaro to leave prison temporarily to undergo hernia surgery on Christmas Day. Bolsonaro’s release for medical reasons marks an important legal and political moment for the country.</p>
<h2>Other Noteworthy News</h2>
<p>Australia is set to deport a British man charged with displaying Nazi symbols, with the immigration minister calling him an unwelcome "guest." In the United States, the Department of Justice released a large batch of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, which mention President Donald Trump and potential co-conspirators. Lastly, internal shifts and family rivalries are reshaping the leadership dynamics within the Murdoch media empire.</p>
