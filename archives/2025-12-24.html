    <h2>Ukraine Peace Plan Developments</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has proposed new steps toward peace in the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. His latest plan includes the idea of establishing demilitarised zones to reduce fighting. On the sensitive issue of Donbas, an area at the heart of the conflict, Zelensky suggested the possibility of creating a "free economic zone." This approach aims to promote economic activity while potentially easing tensions. The proposal is a significant move toward negotiations, though how it will be received by all parties involved remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in Epstein Case</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has discovered about a million additional documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This massive influx of new material means the scheduled release of documents will be delayed by a few weeks as officials review the content. Among the recently released documents were messages mentioning former US President Donald Trump, drawing considerable public attention. The ongoing examination of these files could uncover more information about the case and related figures as the investigation continues.</p>
<h2>Violent Incidents in Moscow and Nigeria</h2>
<p>Authorities in Moscow reported a deadly explosion that killed two police officers. The incident occurred after officers approached a suspicious individual, who then set off a device. The situation highlights security concerns in the area. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, an explosion hit a crowded mosque during evening prayers, according to eyewitnesses. The blast caused chaos, but further details about casualties or perpetrators have not been confirmed. Both incidents underscore continuing risks of violent attacks in different parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Algeria Passes Law Addressing Colonial History</h2>
<p>Algerian lawmakers have unanimously approved a new law declaring France's colonisation of Algeria a crime. The legislation calls for France to issue a formal apology and provide reparations for the harm caused during the colonial period. This move reflects longstanding grievances and a quest for historical justice in Algeria. It may also have implications for relations between Algeria and France moving forward.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Political and Immigration Issues</h2>
<p>In the United States, Representative Joyce Beatty has filed a lawsuit challenging the renaming of the Kennedy Center after Donald Trump. Beatty argues that changing the name requires approval from Congress, making the renaming effort potentially illegal. Additionally, the Trump administration has denied visas to five UK social media campaigners who advocate for technology regulation, barring their entry into the US. These actions highlight ongoing domestic political debates around governance, public institutions, and immigration policy.</p>
<h2>International Dispute Over Oil Tankers</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US and Venezuela escalated after the US seized two Venezuelan oil tankers. Venezuela condemned the move as "extortion," prompting an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the situation. This dispute adds to the strained relations between the two countries and could affect global oil markets and diplomatic efforts in the region.</p>
