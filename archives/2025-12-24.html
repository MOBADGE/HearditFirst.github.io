    <h2>Ukraine Peace Plan Advances</h2>
<p>Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has proposed new measures aimed at resolving conflict in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. A key idea includes creating a "free economic zone" to help ease tensions and encourage cooperation. This proposal suggests demilitarised zones could be part of a broader peace plan. The move comes amid ongoing conflict and aims to lay groundwork for lasting peace, although details remain to be negotiated.</p>
<h2>Epstein Case Documents and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has discovered around a million additional documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This unexpected find has delayed the planned release of materials by several weeks. The documents, part of the largest batch released so far, also include numerous references to Donald Trump and messages fueling public interest and speculation. Meanwhile, new legal activity continues, as cases surrounding the Epstein investigation develop.</p>
<h2>Security Incidents and Arrests Worldwide</h2>
<p>Several violent incidents have occurred around the world. In Nigeria, a bomb exploded inside a mosque in Maiduguri during evening prayers, killing five people and injuring 35 others. In Moscow, two police officers were killed when a device detonated as they approached a suspicious individual. In South Africa, police arrested eleven people following a mass shooting at a tavern. Early investigations suggest the shooting may be linked to conflicts over illegal mining territories.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Actions in the US and Algeria</h2>
<p>In the United States, a legal challenge has been filed against renaming Washington’s Kennedy Center after Donald Trump. US Representative Joyce Beatty argues that such a change requires approval from Congress, and she is seeking to halt the renaming process. Meanwhile, Algeria's parliament unanimously passed a law declaring France's colonisation a crime, demanding an official apology and reparations from the former colonial power. This marks a significant step in Algeria’s efforts to address historical grievances.</p>
<h2>International Tensions and Travel Restrictions</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US and Venezuela escalated after the US seized two Venezuelan oil tankers, which Venezuela condemned as "extortion." The dispute prompted an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the issue. Additionally, five social media campaigners from the UK who have advocated for tech regulation were denied US visas under the current Trump administration, highlighting ongoing political disputes over technology policy and cross-border activism.</p>
