    <h2>Ukraine Peace Plan Moves Forward</h2>
<p>Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has proposed a new peace plan focusing on the eastern Donbas region. A key part of the plan includes establishing "demilitarised zones" to reduce conflict. Zelensky also suggested creating a "free economic zone" in this area as a possible way to promote stability and economic recovery. This approach aims to address one of the most contested parts of Ukraine and could reshape how peace efforts progress in the coming months.</p>
<h2>New Epstein Documents Discovered</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice announced the discovery of around one million additional documents potentially related to the Epstein case. This significant find has delayed the full release of these documents by several weeks, as officials continue to review the new material. The case has long drawn public interest, and the ongoing document review may reveal further details about Epstein's activities and any associated investigations.</p>
<h2>Legal Moves in High-Profile Cases</h2>
<p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has filed an appeal requesting immediate release from prison. Combs argues that his sentence was incorrectly decided and is also seeking to have his conviction overturned. Meanwhile, in a separate legal dispute, U.S. Representative Joyce Beatty, who is also a board member of the Kennedy Center, has sued in an effort to reverse the renaming of the Kennedy Center to include Donald Trump’s name. Beatty claims the name change is illegal because it was done without Congressional approval.</p>
<h2>International Tensions and Security Incidents</h2>
<p>Several international security issues have emerged. In Moscow, two police officers were killed after responding to a suspicious individual who detonated an explosive device. In South Africa, police have arrested eleven people in connection with a deadly tavern shooting believed to be linked to illegal mining turf wars. Additionally, Libya’s army chief, General Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad, died in a plane crash in Turkey along with four others after losing contact with the jet shortly after takeoff from Ankara.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Strains and Controversies</h2>
<p>Algeria's parliament unanimously passed a law declaring France’s colonisation of Algeria as a crime. The law calls for an official apology and reparations from France over its colonial past. In a related international dispute, Venezuela accused the United States of "extortion" after the U.S. seized two Venezuelan oil tankers, prompting an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the issue. Further, the Trump administration barred five social media campaigners, who advocate for more tech regulation, from entering the United States.</p>
<p>These developments highlight ongoing tensions related to colonial histories, diplomatic relations, and international law enforcement.</p>
