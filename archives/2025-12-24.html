    <h2>Epstein Files Release</h2>

This release sheds further light on the intricate network around Epstein, although the full implications are still emerging.</p>
<h2>Australia to Deport British Man</h2>
<p>Australia plans to deport a British man who has been charged with displaying Nazi symbols. The Australian immigration minister described the man as an unwelcome "guest" in the country. This decision reflects strict measures against hate-related symbols and activities in Australia.</p>
<h2>US Denies Visas over Social Media Policies</h2>
<p>The US government has denied visas to Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner and top tech regulator at the European Commission, along with others. This move is connected to disagreements over social media rules. Breton described the situation as a "witch hunt," highlighting tensions between the US and EU on digital regulation and access.</p>
<h2>Pennsylvania Nursing Home Explosion</h2>

Several people have been rescued from the partially collapsed building, but five remain unaccounted for. Emergency crews are continuing search and rescue operations amid ongoing concern for potential survivors.</p>
<h2>Brazil’s Supreme Court Allows Surgery Leave for Bolsonaro</h2>
