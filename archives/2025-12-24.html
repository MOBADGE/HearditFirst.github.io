    <h2>Justice Department Releases Epstein Documents</h2>
<p>The largest release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein was made public by the US Justice Department. These files include notable messages and several mentions of Donald Trump.

This release provides new insight into the Epstein case, which has long attracted significant public and legal attention. It may lead to further investigations or legal actions as more details emerge.</p>
<h2>International Legal and Immigration Issues</h2>
<p>Australia is set to deport a British man charged with displaying Nazi symbols. The country’s immigration minister described the man as an unwelcome "guest," underscoring Australia's strict stance on hate symbols and related offenses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States denied visas to Thierry Breton, a former European Commission tech regulator, among others. Breton has criticized this move, calling it a "witch hunt." The visa denials are part of ongoing tensions over social media regulations between the US and European officials.</p>

<h2>South Africa Investigates Police Corruption</h2>
