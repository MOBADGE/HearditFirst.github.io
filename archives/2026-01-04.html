    <h2>US Military Action in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The United States launched a major strike on Venezuela on January 4, resulting in the capture of Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife. Following these events, Donald Trump stated that the US will "run" Venezuela temporarily and aims to "fix oil infrastructure" to stabilize the country. Trump also mentioned overseeing the nation until a "safe" political transition can be achieved. This intervention marks a significant shift in US policy and carries substantial implications for Venezuela's sovereignty and political future.</p>
<h2>International and Local Reactions to the Venezuela Intervention</h2>
<p>The US action triggered a wide range of responses worldwide. Some global leaders expressed shock and concern over the strike and Maduro’s capture, reflecting unease about the implications for international norms and regional stability. Meanwhile, Venezuelans in Caracas voiced mixed emotions, including hope for change but also apprehension about the consequences of foreign intervention. Residents worry about the political uncertainty ahead and what the future holds for their country after this dramatic upheaval.</p>
<h2>Continued Conflict Against Islamic State</h2>
<p>Alongside developments in Venezuela, the UK and France conducted a joint airstrike targeting an Islamic State weapons bunker in Syria. RAF Typhoon jets participated in the operation, which aimed to disrupt the group’s arms stores. This continued military pressure indicates ongoing international efforts to combat IS influence in the region.</p>
<h2>Police Investigation into Swiss Bar Fire</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, authorities have identified 16 more victims of a recent bar fire, bringing the total of confirmed dead higher. A criminal investigation is underway to determine the cause of the fire. Families continue to face a difficult period as they await the identification of missing loved ones, highlighting the tragedy’s human toll.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Political Disputes in the US</h2>
<p>The Kennedy Center in the US has drawn criticism and seen cancellations from prominent artists following a decision to rename the venue after Donald Trump. Stephen Schwartz, the composer of "Wicked," announced he would no longer perform there, describing the renaming as making the venue an "ideological statement." The controversy reflects ongoing cultural and political divisions linked to Trump’s legacy.</p>
<h2>Warnings About Scams Linked to Brigitte Bardot Foundation</h2>
<p>The Brigitte Bardot Foundation has issued a warning about fraudulent online advertisements selling memorabilia allegedly benefiting the actress’s charity. The foundation cautions the public that these adverts are scams and do not support its causes, urging people to be vigilant when encountering such offers online.</p>
