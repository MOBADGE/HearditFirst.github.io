    <h2>Venezuela Crisis and US Intervention</h2>
<p>The United States launched military strikes on Venezuela over the weekend, leading to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife by US forces. Following their arrest, Donald Trump stated that the US will "run" Venezuela and plans to "fix oil infrastructure" in the country. He also mentioned overseeing a transition to restore stability before handing control back to Venezuelans. This marks a significant escalation in US involvement in Venezuela's political affairs.</p>
<h2>Reactions to the Venezuela Strikes</h2>
<p>The US intervention has drawn a mixed global response. Many world leaders expressed deep shock and concern over the US military action against Venezuela. Meanwhile, residents in Caracas expressed a combination of hope and anxiety about the future. Some hope that Maduro's arrest could lead to positive change, but there is uncertainty about what will follow after the US assumes control, especially considering Venezuela's already tense political situation.</p>
<h2>Middle East Military Action and Tensions</h2>
<p>In Syria, UK and French air forces conducted a joint strike on an underground arms bunker used by the Islamic State group. The operation involved RAF Typhoon jets and French aircraft targeting the weapons store, aiming to disrupt militant activities in the region. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and Iran continue to simmer. The US president warned that Washington would "come to the rescue" of peaceful protesters in Iran if they are harmed, a statement the Iranian foreign minister labeled "reckless."</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Updates</h2>
<p>In the United States, composer Stephen Schwartz announced he would cancel an upcoming performance at the Kennedy Center in protest of the venue's recent name change to include "Trump" in its title. Schwartz described the venue as having become "an ideological statement," indicating dissent within the arts community.</p>
<p>Separately, the foundation linked to actress Brigitte Bardot warned the public about online scams selling fake memorabilia. These adverts falsely claim that proceeds will benefit Bardot’s charity, prompting caution among potential buyers.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Authorities in Switzerland continue their investigation into a deadly fire at a bar, identifying 16 more victims. The criminal investigation aims to uncover the fire’s cause as families face the painful wait to identify missing loved ones. This tragic event has deeply impacted the local community, emphasizing the ongoing need for safety and accountability.</p>
