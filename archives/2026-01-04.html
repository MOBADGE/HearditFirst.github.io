    <h2>US Military Action in Venezuela</h2>
<p>On January 4, the United States launched strikes in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Former US President Donald Trump stated that the US will "run" Venezuela and "fix oil infrastructure" until a "safe" political transition is arranged. These actions mark a significant intervention by the US in Venezuelan affairs. The future political situation in Venezuela remains uncertain, with discussions ongoing about who will govern the country next.</p>
<h2>International Reactions to Venezuela Operation</h2>
<p>The US strikes on Venezuela and the capture of Maduro prompted mixed reactions among world leaders. Many expressed shock and concern over the US military intervention. The move has sparked debate about international norms and the sovereignty of nations. The global response will likely influence diplomatic relations and the broader geopolitical landscape in the region.</p>
<h2>Venezuelan Public Response</h2>
<p>Residents of Caracas have expressed a mix of hope and worry following Maduro's arrest. Some see the removal of Maduro as a potential step towards change, while others remain anxious about the consequences of US involvement. The political climate in Venezuela is tense, and many people acknowledge that significant challenges lie ahead as the country navigates this new phase.</p>
<h2>UK and France Strike in Syria</h2>
<p>In related international security news, the UK and France conducted a joint airstrike targeting an Islamic State arms bunker in Syria. RAF Typhoon jets flew alongside French aircraft in the operation. This action reflects ongoing efforts by Western nations to counter armed extremist groups in the region. It underscores the continuing military focus on stabilizing parts of the Middle East.</p>
<h2>US Statements on Iran Protests</h2>
<p>Separately, the US president issued a warning about Iran’s protests, saying that Washington "will come to their rescue" if peaceful demonstrators are killed. Iran’s foreign minister criticized this statement as "reckless," highlighting tensions between the two countries. This exchange reflects the sensitive nature of international responses to internal unrest in Iran and raises concerns about potential escalations.</p>
