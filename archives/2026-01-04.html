    <h2>Venezuela Crisis and Maduro's Capture</h2>
<p>The United States carried out a large-scale military operation in Venezuela, resulting in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Former US President Donald Trump stated that the US would “run” Venezuela until a “safe” transition could be established. This intervention has sparked mixed reactions worldwide and has left Venezuelans uncertain about their future. Residents in Caracas expressed both hope for change and concern about the political instability that may follow the US involvement.</p>
<h2>International Reactions to US Actions in Venezuela</h2>
<p>World leaders have responded with a range of emotions following the US strike against Venezuela. Many officials expressed shock and caution regarding the US’s unilateral approach. The operation has raised questions about the legality and potential consequences of foreign military interventions in sovereign nations. The global community is closely watching how this situation develops and what it means for regional stability in Latin America.</p>
<h2>UK and French Military Strike in Syria</h2>
<p>In a separate military operation, the United Kingdom and France conducted a joint air strike in Syria. British RAF Typhoon jets and French aircraft targeted an underground weapons cache belonging to the Islamic State group. Officials reported that the strike aimed to weaken the militant group's capabilities in the region. This operation highlights ongoing international efforts to combat terrorism and stabilize conflict areas in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Tensions Over Protest Responses</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated following comments from former US President Trump regarding Iran’s protests. Trump warned that if peaceful protesters are killed, the US “will come to their rescue.” Iran’s foreign minister called these remarks “reckless,” criticizing the threat as interference in Iran’s internal affairs. This exchange adds to existing strains between the two countries and may complicate diplomatic efforts in the region.</p>
