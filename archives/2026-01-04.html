    <h2>US Operation in Venezuela Sparks Global Reactions</h2>
<p>The United States carried out a large-scale strike in Venezuela resulting in the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, often described as a powerful figure with past allegations of corruption and nepotism. Maduro's close ally, Delcy Rodríguez, has been named interim president following the operation. The event has drawn mixed reactions from world leaders, with some expressing deep shock. Satellite images and maps have documented the operation, highlighting its complexity. Experts warn that the US action might set a precedent for authoritarian practices globally, as former US President Donald Trump appeared to suggest that he could define privileges that others cannot access.</p>
<h2>Violence in Niger State, Nigeria</h2>
<p>Security challenges continue in Nigeria's Niger state, where at least 30 people were killed in a recent attack on a village. This incident marks the latest violence in the area, which previously experienced a mass abduction that disrupted school reopening plans. Despite official announcements that schools could resume, the ongoing violence raises concerns about stability and safety for residents.</p>
<h2>Disrupted Air Travel in Europe Due to Greek Airspace Issue</h2>
<p>Thousands of travelers across Europe faced delays as Greek airspace temporarily suspended arrivals and departures. The disruption was caused by a fault in radio communication systems used by air traffic controllers. The interruption affected flights throughout the day, highlighting vulnerabilities in air traffic infrastructure and the broad impact of technical faults on travel.</p>
<h2>Berlin Power Outage Linked to Activist Group</h2>
<p>The left-wing activist collective known as the Vulkan Gruppe has claimed responsibility for a fire that caused power outages affecting thousands in Berlin. The group stated that its objective was to target the fossil fuel economy rather than intending to cut power service broadly. The incident underscores ongoing tensions around energy policies and protests against fossil fuel dependency.</p>
<h2>Memorial for Swiss Bar Fire Victims</h2>
<p>A special Mass was held in Switzerland to honor the victims of a deadly fire at a bar on New Year's Eve. Emotional scenes of mourners expressing grief through tears and embraces marked the event, as communities continue to process the tragedy and support those affected by the loss.</p>
