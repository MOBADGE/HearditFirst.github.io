    <h2>US Military Action in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The US launched a military strike on Venezuela on Saturday, capturing the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, according to reports. Former US president Donald Trump indicated that the US will temporarily "run" Venezuela, with plans to "fix oil infrastructure" and oversee a transition period. This significant intervention marks a major shift in US involvement in Venezuela, though the specifics of the transition and international response remain unsettled.</p>
<h2>International and Local Reactions to Venezuela Strike</h2>
<p>There has been a mixed reaction from world leaders following the US strike and Maduro’s capture. Some expressed shock and concern over the US action, highlighting its potential consequences for regional stability. Meanwhile, residents of Caracas voiced a combination of hope for change and worry about the uncertain future under foreign intervention. The situation on the ground remains tense as Venezuelans and the international community await further developments.</p>
<h2>Security and Education Developments in Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, schools located in areas deemed "safe and secure" are beginning to reopen after a mass abduction in November in which 250 children were taken. This partial reopening signals progress in security efforts but also reflects ongoing challenges in restoring normalcy and safety in affected regions.</p>
<h2>UK and France Conduct Air Strike in Syria</h2>
<p>UK and French military forces conducted an air strike targeting an Islamic State arms bunker underground in Syria. RAF Typhoon jets joined French aircraft in the precision attack aimed at disrupting militant operations. Officials emphasized the strike as part of continued efforts to contain extremist groups in the region.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Consumer Notes</h2>
<p>Stephen Schwartz, the composer of the musical "Wicked," has cancelled an upcoming performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington, citing concerns that the venue’s recent renaming after Donald Trump has turned it into "an ideological statement." In a separate consumer alert, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation warned about online scams selling memorabilia falsely claiming proceeds would benefit the actress’s charity. Buyers are advised to be cautious about such fraudulent offers.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have identified 16 more victims of a deadly fire at Le Constellation bar, including 16-year-old Arthur Brodard. The incident has deeply affected the local community, and investigations continue to determine the cause of the blaze.</p>
