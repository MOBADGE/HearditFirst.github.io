    <h2>Venezuela Crisis and US Intervention</h2>
<p>The United States launched a large-scale military strike in Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Following the operation, Donald Trump stated that the US will "run" Venezuela and work to "fix oil infrastructure" until a "safe" political transition can be established. This intervention marks a significant shift in US-Venezuela relations and has raised questions about the country's future governance and stability.</p>
<h2>International and Local Reactions</h2>
<p>The US attack on Venezuela has elicited mixed responses globally. World leaders have expressed a range of views, with some condemning the action and others cautiously observing the developments. In Venezuela, residents of Caracas have shared feelings of both hope and concern. While some see Maduro's arrest as a potential turning point, many remain worried about the uncertainty and risks associated with foreign intervention amid an already tense political climate.</p>
<h2>Security and Education Updates in Nigeria</h2>
<p>After a mass abduction incident in Nigeria in November, involving the kidnapping of 250 children, some schools in "safe and secure areas" are now permitted to reopen. This step represents a cautious effort to restore normalcy and education access while addressing ongoing security challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>UK and France Strike on IS Arms Bunker</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom and France conducted a joint airstrike on an Islamic State (IS) arms depot in Syria. RAF Typhoon jets, alongside French aircraft, targeted the underground weapons store. This operation is part of continued efforts to counter IS activity and disrupt its supply and operational capabilities in the region.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Consumer Warnings</h2>
<p>Stephen Schwartz, the composer associated with the musical Wicked, announced he will no longer perform at the Kennedy Center, criticizing the venue for becoming "an ideological statement" following its recent renaming that reflects political associations. Meanwhile, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation issued a warning about fraudulent online advertisements selling merchandise purportedly linked to the actress, with claims that proceeds would benefit her charity. The foundation clarified that these claims are scams and cautioned the public.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Regional Tensions and Protests</h2>
<p>In the context of protests in Iran, Donald Trump warned that the US would intervene if peaceful demonstrators are harmed. This statement drew criticism from Iran’s foreign minister, who described it as "reckless," highlighting ongoing tensions between the two countries.</p>
