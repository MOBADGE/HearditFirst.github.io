    <h2>US Military Action in Venezuela and International Reactions</h2>
<p>The United States launched a large-scale strike on Venezuela, leading to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Following Maduro’s detainment, Delcy Rodríguez, a close ally, was named interim president. Maduro's first lady, Cilia Flores, known for her influential role and facing past allegations of corruption, was also captured. The operation was detailed through photos and satellite images, showing the scale and precision of the mission.</p>
<p>World leaders responded with mixed reactions to the US intervention, with some expressing shock and concern over the strike and Maduro’s capture. The event is significant as it could reshape power dynamics in Venezuela and influence international relations with the US.</p>
<h2>Political Tensions Between the US and Denmark</h2>
<p>Denmark’s Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, publicly addressed US President Trump regarding his comments on Greenland. Frederiksen stated that the United States has no right to annex any part of the Danish kingdom, which includes Greenland and two other nations. This clear message underscores ongoing tensions between the US and Denmark concerning territorial sovereignty and diplomatic respect.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns in Nigeria</h2>
<p>At least 30 people were killed in an attack on a village in Nigeria’s Niger state. This violent incident adds to a series of recent attacks in the area. The attack occurred just one day after officials announced plans to reopen schools that had been closed following a mass abduction last year, highlighting ongoing security challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Disruption to Air Travel Across Europe</h2>
<p>Thousands of travelers across Europe were stranded due to disruptions in the Greek airspace. The problem originated from a fault in radio communications, forcing air traffic controllers to temporarily stop arrivals and departures. This suspension affected numerous flights and caused travel delays, illustrating the vulnerability of air traffic operations to technical failures.</p>
<h2>Activism and Violence in Berlin</h2>
<p>The far-left activist group Vulkan Gruppe claimed responsibility for a fire that caused a power outage affecting thousands in Berlin. The group stated their primary goal was to target the fossil fuel economy rather than to cut power for people. This action reflects heightened tensions and direct activism against fossil fuels amid broader environmental and political debates.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Relations and Protests</h2>
<p>US President Trump issued a warning concerning protests in Iran, stating that Washington would intervene if peaceful protesters were killed. Iran’s foreign minister criticized this statement as "reckless," indicating strained diplomatic relations between the two countries. The comment highlights escalated rhetoric amid ongoing unrest in Iran.</p>
