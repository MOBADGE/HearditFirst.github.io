    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 04, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The United States conducted a large-scale military strike on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. This operation was documented with photos, satellite images, and maps, showing the transition from Maduro’s Caracas stronghold to a New York court. The move has sparked a range of reactions internationally, with some world leaders expressing shock. Meanwhile, the first lady of Venezuela, Cilia Flores, also detained by the US, is recognized as a powerful figure within Venezuelan politics, though she has faced allegations of corruption and nepotism.</p>
<p>In a related development, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen condemned US President Donald Trump’s statements regarding Greenland, insisting that the US has no right to annex any part of the Danish kingdom, which includes Greenland and two other nations. This statement follows tensions sparked by Trump's remarks about Greenland.</p>
<h2>US Political Climate</h2>
<p>Donald Trump’s recent actions and statements continue to draw criticism. One commentary highlighted concerns that Trump seems to act with a sense of exclusive entitlement, as if rules apply only to him and not to others. This approach risks setting a precedent that could encourage authoritarian tendencies around the world. Additionally, Trump issued a warning regarding protests in Iran, stating that if peaceful demonstrators are harmed, the US will intervene to support them. Iran’s foreign minister described this warning as reckless.</p>
<h2>Security and Violence</h2>
<p>Violence in various regions remains a pressing concern. In Nigeria’s Niger state, attackers killed at least 30 people in a village, adding to a series of violent incidents in the area. This attack occurred shortly after officials announced that schools could reopen following a previous mass abduction. In Switzerland, authorities identified all 40 victims of a recent deadly fire at the Le Constellation bar, including a 16-year-old Swiss national whose mother confirmed his death.</p>
<h2>Travel Disruptions in Europe</h2>
<p>Thousands of travelers across Europe faced delays after Greece’s airspace was temporarily closed due to a fault in radio communications. Air traffic controllers had to suspend arrivals and departures, causing widespread disruption. The problem affected flights throughout the region as Greece handles significant international air traffic.</p>
<h2>Consumer Alert</h2>
<p>The Brigitte Bardot Foundation issued a warning about scam memorabilia being sold online. Some advertisements claim that purchases will support Bardot’s charity, but the foundation cautions the public to be aware of fraudulent campaigns using the actress’s name for dishonest purposes. Buyers are advised to verify authenticity before making donations or purchases.</p>
