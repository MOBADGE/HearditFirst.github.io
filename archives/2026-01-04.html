    <h2>US Military Action in Venezuela</h2>
<p>On Saturday, the United States launched a military strike on Venezuela resulting in the capture of Nicolás Maduro and his wife by US forces. Following these events, Donald Trump stated that the US will take charge of Venezuela and work on fixing its oil infrastructure. This intervention has significant implications for Venezuela’s political future and the region’s stability.</p>
<h2>Reactions to US Intervention in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The US strike and Maduro’s capture elicited mixed responses from global leaders and Venezuelans alike. Some leaders expressed deep shock at the scale of the attack, highlighting concerns about international norms and sovereignty. Meanwhile, residents in Caracas voiced a mixture of hope and apprehension, uncertain about the country’s path forward amid political tension and foreign involvement.</p>
<h2>European Travel Disruptions</h2>
<p>Thousands of people were stranded across Europe on Saturday due to a disruption in Greek airspace. The issue stemmed from a fault with radio communications, which led air traffic controllers to temporarily suspend arrivals and departures. The situation caused widespread travel delays and cancellations throughout the region.</p>

<h2>UK and French Military Strike in Syria</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom and France conducted a joint airstrike on an Islamic State group arms bunker in Syria. RAF Typhoon jets participated alongside French aircraft in the bombing of an underground weapons store. This operation underscores ongoing efforts by international forces to combat IS presence in the region.</p>
