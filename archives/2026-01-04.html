    <h2>International Relations and US Actions in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The United States carried out a large-scale strike in Venezuela resulting in the capture of Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader. Delcy Rodríguez, known as a close ally of Maduro, has been named interim president following the operation. Maduro’s capture has drawn a range of reactions globally, with some world leaders expressing they are deeply shocked by the US attack. The operation has been documented through photos, satellite images, and maps, highlighting the scale and complexity of the mission.</p>
<h2>Political Implications and Views on US Leadership</h2>
<p>In the US, President Donald Trump’s role in the Venezuela operation has sparked commentary. Some voices argue that Trump’s actions could set a precedent for authoritarian powers worldwide, suggesting an approach where certain individuals act as though they alone make the rules and others should not have similar privileges. Additionally, Trump’s warning regarding protests in Iran—where he stated that the US "will come to their rescue" if peaceful protesters are harmed—was called “reckless” by Iran’s foreign minister.</p>
<h2>Violence and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Security issues remain pressing in parts of the world. In Nigeria, at least 30 people were killed during an attack on a village in Niger state. This incident is part of a recent pattern of violent attacks in the region, coinciding with officials’ announcements about schools reopening after a prior mass abduction. The ongoing violence underscores continued instability and challenges in protecting vulnerable communities.</p>
<h2>Disruptions in European Transportation</h2>
<p>Thousands of travelers were affected across Europe due to disruptions in Greek airspace. A fault in radio communications forced air traffic controllers to halt arrivals and departures temporarily. This interruption caused widespread delays and left many passengers stranded, highlighting vulnerabilities in air travel infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Activism and Energy Sector Attacks</h2>
<p>The far-left activist group Vulkan Gruppe has taken responsibility for a fire in Berlin that cut power to thousands. The group stated their objective was to target the fossil fuel economy rather than cause power outages directly. This action reflects ongoing tensions around environmental activism and energy policies in Europe.</p>
<h2>Community Mourning in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Communities continue to cope with the aftermath of a deadly New Year’s Eve bar fire in Switzerland. A special Mass held for the victims was marked by visible emotions, with mourners expressing grief through tears and embraces. This gathering reflects the communal efforts to heal after the tragic event.</p>
