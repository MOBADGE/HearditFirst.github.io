    <h2>US Military Action in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The United States carried out strikes in Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Nicolás Maduro and his wife by US forces. Donald Trump said the US will "run" Venezuela until a "safe" transition can be established. He also mentioned plans to "fix oil infrastructure" in the country. This intervention marks a significant shift in US involvement in Venezuela and raises questions about the future political landscape and stability of the region.</p>
<h2>Global Reactions to US Strike on Venezuela</h2>
<p>World leaders expressed mixed reactions to the US operation in Venezuela. Some are stunned, while others are assessing the implications of the US's direct military involvement. The attack and Maduro’s capture have heightened international tensions, with global authorities watching closely to see how the situation will evolve and how it may impact regional and global politics.</p>
<h2>Venezuelan Public Responds with Mixed Feelings</h2>
<p>In Caracas, people expressed a combination of hope and concern following the arrest of Maduro. Some residents are hopeful the intervention may lead to positive changes, while many remain worried about the uncertainty and what US governance might mean for their future. The political climate remains tense, emphasizing the challenges ahead as the country deals with the aftermath of the intervention.</p>
<h2>UK and France Conduct Strike in Syria</h2>
<p>Separately, the UK and France jointly carried out airstrikes targeting an Islamic State arms bunker located underground in Syria. RAF Typhoon jets took part alongside French aircraft in this operation. The attack is part of ongoing efforts to combat terrorism and weaken IS forces in the region.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Tensions Over Protests</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump issued a warning regarding protests in Iran, stating that if peaceful protesters are harmed, the US "will come to their rescue." Iran's foreign minister labeled this threat as "reckless," highlighting the increasing tensions between the two countries. This exchange underscores the difficulties in diplomatic relations amid ongoing unrest in Iran.</p>
