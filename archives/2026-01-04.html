    <h2>Venezuela Crisis and US Intervention</h2>
<p>The United States launched a large-scale strike in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Former US President Donald Trump said American forces would "run" Venezuela until a "safe" transition is achieved. This dramatic development has sparked mixed reactions worldwide, with some leaders expressing shock while others remain cautious about the implications.</p>
<p>In Caracas, the mood is complex as residents balance a sense of hope for change with concerns about the aftermath of foreign intervention. Many Venezuelans worry about political instability and what the future holds for their country as US involvement deepens.</p>
<h2>International Responses to Maduro's Capture</h2>
<p>World leaders and the international community have responded to the US action in Venezuela with a range of views. Some have expressed deep shock at the strike and the capture of Maduro. The event marks a significant escalation in US foreign policy in the region and raises questions about the legality and consequences of such unilateral military interventions.</p>
<p>This situation could affect diplomatic relations and political dynamics in Latin America and beyond, depending on how the US manages its role in Venezuela moving forward.</p>
<h2>UK and France Conduct Air Strike in Syria</h2>
<p>In Syria, joint military efforts continued as RAF Typhoon jets from the UK teamed up with French aircraft to target an underground Islamic State arms cache. The strike aims to disrupt the capabilities of IS militants in the region and support ongoing international efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
<p>This coordinated action reflects continued Western commitment to counterterrorism operations in Syria amid ongoing regional instability.</p>
<h2>Tensions Rise Over Iran Protests</h2>
<p>In the United States, the current president warned that Washington "will come to the rescue" if peaceful protesters in Iran are killed amid ongoing demonstrations. Iran’s foreign minister called this statement "reckless," highlighting the sensitivity and potential for heightened tensions in US-Iran relations.</p>
<p>The situation underscores the ongoing volatility in Iran and the broader Middle East, where protests and government responses continue to draw international attention and concern.</p>
