    <h2>US-Venezuela Conflict and International Reactions</h2>
<p>The United States conducted a large-scale strike on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The operation, documented through photos, satellite imagery, and maps, has triggered mixed reactions among world leaders. Some express shock and concern over the US intervention in Caracas, highlighting worries about the political future of Venezuela.</p>
<p>Residents in Caracas show a range of emotions, mixing hope for change with anxiety about what will come next after the US action. The tense political environment means many are unsure how the situation will unfold in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h2>US Politics and Global Concerns</h2>
<p>Donald Trump faces criticism for actions viewed as setting a precedent for authoritarian behavior. Some commentators argue that Trump acts as if he alone creates the rules and excludes others from similar privileges. This perception raises concerns about the potential influence of such conduct on global governance and the spread of authoritarian powers worldwide.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, controversies linked to Trump continue in other spheres. Composer Stephen Schwartz has canceled a planned performance at the Kennedy Center, citing dissatisfaction with recent changes that have turned the venue into what he calls an "ideological statement."</p>
<h2>Europe and Travel Disruptions</h2>
<p>Thousands of travelers were affected by a disruption in Greek airspace after a technical fault with radio communications caused air traffic controllers to temporarily halt arrivals and departures. The incident led to widespread delays and stranded passengers across Europe, showing the vulnerabilities in aviation infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Tragedy in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have identified 16 more victims of a deadly bar fire at Le Constellation. Among the deceased is 16-year-old Arthur Brodard, confirmed by his mother. This tragic event has deeply impacted the local community as investigations continue.</p>
<h2>Education Developments in Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, schools in areas deemed "safe and secure" are set to begin reopening following the mass abduction of 250 children in November. This step marks cautious progress toward restoring normalcy and education access despite ongoing security challenges.</p>
<h2>Public Warnings and Social Issues</h2>
<p>The Brigitte Bardot Foundation has issued a warning about online scams involving memorabilia. Fraudsters are advertising merchandise supposedly linked to the actress, claiming proceeds will support her charity. The foundation urges the public to be aware and cautious of such deceptive offers.</p>
<p>In international protest news, US President Trump’s warning to Iran that Washington "will come to the rescue" if peaceful protesters are killed has been labeled "reckless" by Iran's foreign minister, underscoring ongoing tensions around protest movements and foreign involvement.</p>
