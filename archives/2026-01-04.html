    <h2>International Affairs: US-Venezuela Conflict and Global Reactions</h2>
<p>The United States recently conducted a large-scale strike in Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The operation was extensively documented through photos, satellite images, and maps, highlighting the scale and coordination involved. Maduro's first lady, Cilia Flores, was also taken into custody. Flores is known as a powerful figure in Venezuelan politics and has faced accusations of corruption and nepotism. The US action has sparked a range of responses worldwide, with some leaders expressing deep shock and concern about the strike and its implications.</p>
<h2>Political Tensions: Trump and International Disputes</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump’s recent remarks and actions continue to stir controversy. Observers have pointed out that Trump's attitude suggests he believes he can set rules exclusively for himself while denying others the same privileges, potentially setting a concerning precedent for authoritarian behavior globally. Additionally, Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, publicly urged Trump to cease what she described as "threats" against Greenland, emphasizing that the United States has no right to annex parts of the Danish kingdom.</p>
<h2>Security and Violence: Attacks in Nigeria and Switzerland</h2>
<p>Tragic violence was reported in Nigeria, where at least 30 people were killed in an attack on a village in Niger state. This incident adds to a series of violent assaults in the area. The attack occurred just one day after officials announced that schools might reopen following a previous mass abduction, underscoring ongoing security challenges in the region.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, authorities have identified all 40 victims of a deadly fire at a bar called Le Constellation. Among those who died was 16-year-old Swiss national Arthur Brodard, confirmed by his mother. The cause of the blaze has not been detailed, but the loss has deeply affected the local community.</p>
<h2>Transport Disruption: Greece Airspace Closure</h2>
<p>Thousands of travelers across Europe faced significant delays as Greek airspace was temporarily closed due to a malfunction in radio communications systems. Air traffic controllers had to suspend both arrivals and departures, causing widespread disruption in flights. The temporary nature of the shutdown allowed for the issue to be resolved, but the incident highlighted vulnerabilities in critical aviation infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Warnings: Iran Protests and Charity Scams</h2>
<p>Tensions are rising in Iran where protests are ongoing. The US president issued a warning saying that if peaceful protesters are killed, Washington "will come to their rescue." Iran’s foreign minister criticized this statement as "reckless," suggesting it could exacerbate tensions rather than help resolve the crisis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation issued a public warning about scams involving fake memorabilia of the actress. Some online advertisements claim that proceeds from merchandise sales will benefit her charity, but these assertions are false, and the foundation is cautioning people against falling victim to these fraudulent schemes.</p>
