    <h2>US Military Action in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The United States carried out military strikes in Venezuela over the weekend, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Following their detention, Maduro was brought to New York and placed into US custody. Former US President Donald Trump stated that the US would "run" Venezuela temporarily to "fix oil infrastructure" and oversee a "safe" transition. This marks a significant intervention in Venezuela's political landscape, with the US taking a direct role in the country's governance for the time being.</p>
<h2>Reactions to the Venezuela Operation</h2>
<p>The US military action and Maduro's capture have sparked mixed reactions globally. Some world leaders expressed shock and concern, highlighting the unprecedented nature of the US operation on Venezuelan soil. In Venezuela, reactions among citizens are equally varied. While some Caracas residents see Maduro's arrest as a hopeful step toward change, many remain uneasy and apprehensive about the future. There is widespread uncertainty regarding what US control will mean for everyday life amidst the country's ongoing political tensions.</p>
<h2>UK and France Conduct Airstrike in Syria</h2>
<p>In a separate development, UK and French military forces launched an airstrike targeting an Islamic State arms bunker underground in Syria. RAF Typhoon jets participated alongside French aircraft in the operation, which officials say aimed to disrupt IS weapon supplies. This joint mission represents continued efforts by Western countries to combat extremist groups in the region.</p>
<h2>Cultural Sector Responds to Kennedy Center Name Change</h2>
<p>In the United States, the Kennedy Center has recently undergone a controversial name change involving the name Trump. Stephen Schwartz, the composer behind the musical Wicked, announced he will no longer perform at the venue. He described the venue's new identity as having become "an ideological statement," indicating that the name change has unsettled some artists and may affect future cultural programming.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, authorities identified 16 more victims of a recent fire at the Le Constellation bar, including a 16-year-old Swiss national, Arthur Brodard. Meanwhile, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation has issued a warning about online scams selling memorabilia purportedly benefiting the actress’s charity, cautioning the public against such fraudulent advertisements.</p>
<p>Also, in response to ongoing protests in Iran, the US president issued a warning that Washington "will come to their rescue" if peaceful protesters are harmed. Iran’s foreign minister called this statement "reckless," underscoring heightened tensions surrounding the issue.</p>
