    <h2>International Conflict and Reactions</h2>
<p>The United States launched a large-scale strike on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. This operation has drawn mixed reactions from world leaders, with some expressing deep shock. Visual coverage of the event includes photos, satellite images, and maps showing the sequence from Maduro's Caracas stronghold to a New York court. The capture has significant geopolitical implications, reflecting tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>US Political Developments and Global Impact</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump faces criticism for actions perceived as attempting to place himself above the law, raising concerns about setting a dangerous precedent for authoritarian behavior globally. Additionally, Trump's recent statements about potentially intervening if peaceful protests in Iran are suppressed have been called "reckless" by the Iranian foreign minister. These developments highlight ongoing tensions in US foreign relations.</p>
<h2>Violence and Security in Africa</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, a violent attack on a village in Niger state killed at least 30 people. This incident follows a series of violent events in the region, including a mass abduction last year. Local officials had recently announced the reopening of schools, underscoring the ongoing security challenges faced by communities in the area.</p>
<h2>Human Tragedies in Europe</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have identified all 40 victims of a fatal fire at the Le Constellation bar. Among those who died is 16-year-old Arthur Brodard, confirmed by his mother. This tragic event has deeply affected the community and raised concerns about fire safety measures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of travelers across Europe experienced disruption as air traffic controllers in Greece suspended flights temporarily due to a radio communications fault. The disruption affected arrivals and departures, causing widespread travel delays.</p>
<h2>Denmark and Greenland Dispute</h2>
<p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has publicly urged Donald Trump to cease threats regarding Greenland. Frederiksen emphasized that the United States has no right to annex any part of Denmark’s kingdom, which includes Greenland. This statement underscores ongoing diplomatic tensions between Denmark and the US over territorial issues.</p>
<h2>Cultural News and Consumer Warning</h2>
<p>The Brigitte Bardot Foundation has issued a warning about a scam involving merchandise allegedly linked to the actress. Online advertisements claim proceeds from the sales support her charity, but the foundation has clarified these are false claims. Consumers are advised to be cautious of such offers.</p>
