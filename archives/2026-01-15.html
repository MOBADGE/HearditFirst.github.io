    <h2>Middle East and Iran</h2>
<p>In Iran, multiple sources report that security forces are demanding large sums of money from families before releasing the bodies of protesters who have died. This practice is causing distress among relatives seeking to bury their loved ones. Meanwhile, the Iranian judiciary has denied plans to execute Erfan Soltani, a detained protester, stating he is not facing charges warranting the death penalty. A rights group had earlier reported that his execution was postponed, highlighting ongoing tensions linked to protests and the government's response.</p>
<h2>Africa Elections and Politics</h2>
<p>Uganda is currently counting votes after a significant election that is a rematch between Bobi Wine and Yoweri Museveni, who has served as president for 40 years. The opposition has alleged rigging in the process, raising concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of the election outcome. This development is closely watched as it could impact Uganda's political stability and future governance.</p>
<h2>International Military Presence</h2>
<p>In Greenland, a small contingent of European military personnel has arrived, with more expected in the coming days. This move comes amid statements from former US President Donald Trump, who emphasized that the United States needs to secure the island, indicating growing strategic interest in the Arctic region. The increased military presence could reflect broader geopolitical competition in this area.</p>
<h2>Space and Science</h2>
<p>Four astronauts from Crew-11 safely returned to Earth following a medical evacuation from the International Space Station. They expressed relief and happiness upon safely landing back on Earth, marking the end of their unexpected mission extension and showcasing the ongoing capabilities of space agencies to handle emergencies in orbit.</p>
<h2>Aviation Safety</h2>
<p>A recent report from US investigators revealed that Boeing was aware of a structural flaw in a part linked to a plane crash in November involving a UPS aircraft. The flaw had been identified by Boeing 15 years ago. This finding raises questions about corporate responsibility and aviation safety, potentially impacting regulatory decisions and Boeing’s operational oversight.</p>
<h2>US Operations in the Caribbean</h2>
<p>The US military’s Southern Command announced the seizure of a Venezuela-linked oil tanker named Veronica in the Caribbean Sea during a pre-dawn operation that took place without incident. This is the sixth such tanker seized, underscoring ongoing US efforts to enforce sanctions or disrupt certain Venezuelan maritime activities. The operation reflects continued tensions related to Venezuela’s economic and political situation.</p>
