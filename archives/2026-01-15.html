    <h2>Iran: Controversy Over Protester Bodies and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Authorities in Iran are reportedly demanding large sums of money from families seeking the return of bodies of protesters, according to multiple sources speaking to BBC Persian. Security forces have withheld these bodies until relatives pay the requested amounts. Meanwhile, the Iranian judiciary has denied reports that detained protester Erfan Soltani faces execution. Officials said Soltani is not charged with any crimes warranting the death penalty, and a rights group stated that his execution has been postponed. These developments highlight ongoing tensions in Iran regarding the treatment of protesters and legal proceedings.</p>
<h2>NATO Allies Deploy Troops and Vessels to Greenland</h2>
<p>European NATO member countries including Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have deployed troops and vessels to Greenland. The deployment is limited in scale and aims to enhance military presence in the region. France confirmed that a small military contingent has already arrived, with more forces expected in the coming days. This move reflects increasing strategic interest in Greenland amid broader geopolitical considerations, including remarks from former US President Donald Trump emphasizing the island's importance to the United States.</p>
<h2>Taliban Leadership Divided on Key Issues</h2>
<p>A BBC investigation reveals a split within the top leadership of the Taliban, centered on differing views about women’s roles, internet access, and religious practices. The current leader of the group had previously warned about such divisions. This internal clash underscores ongoing power struggles and policy debates within the Taliban, which could affect governance and social policies in areas under their control.</p>
<h2>Space Crew Returns After Medical Evacuation</h2>
<p>Four astronauts from the Crew-11 mission safely returned to Earth following a medical evacuation from the International Space Station. Reports describe their positive mood as they stepped out of their spacecraft after splashdown. This successful return marks an important moment in maintaining crew health during extended space missions and demonstrates effective emergency procedures in orbit.</p>
<h2>US Military Seizes Sixth Venezuela-Linked Oil Tanker</h2>
<p>In the Caribbean Sea, US forces conducted a predawn operation to seize the oil tanker Veronica, marking the sixth Venezuela-linked tanker interception. The operation was carried out without incident, according to the US Southern Command. These seizures are part of ongoing efforts by the United States to enforce sanctions and control shipments linked to Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Boeing Knew of Plane Part Flaw Before Crash</h2>
<p>An investigation by US safety officials found that Boeing was aware of a structural flaw in a component linked to a cargo plane crash in November 15 years ago. The report highlights longstanding issues related to aircraft safety and part maintenance, raising questions about oversight and corporate responsibility in aviation safety.</p>
