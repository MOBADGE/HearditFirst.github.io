    <h2>Middle East Tensions and Iran Airspace Closure</h2>
<p>The US president reported that "killing has stopped" in Iran following a violent crackdown on protests, though he has not ruled out the possibility of military action. Meanwhile, Iran temporarily closed its airspace to nearly all flights amid the unrest. This development highlights ongoing tensions in the region, with the potential for further escalation depending on how the situation evolves.</p>
<h2>Political Divisions Within the Taliban</h2>
<p>A BBC investigation has revealed significant divisions within the Taliban's leadership over issues such as women's rights, internet access, and the role of religion. These differences reflect challenges to unity at the highest levels of the group, potentially affecting their governance and policies going forward.</p>
<h2>Developments in Greenland Discussions</h2>
<p>Discussions between the White House and Danish officials on Greenland ended without major breakthroughs. The US president reiterated his interest in acquiring the island shortly after the talks. Denmark warned of a "fundamental disagreement," indicating that negotiations may continue but with significant obstacles remaining.</p>
<h2>Energy Emergency Declared in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukraine has declared a state of energy emergency amid persistent cold weather that is putting pressure on the country's power systems. This announcement comes as the US president commented that Ukraine appears "less ready" than Russia to reach a peace deal. The energy crisis may complicate the broader political and security challenges facing Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Tragic Train Crash in Thailand</h2>

In the United States, a federal agent shot a man in Minneapolis in self-defense after being attacked with a shovel. Additionally, Uganda's election faced widespread delays amid an internet shutdown; the vote is a high-profile contest between long-time president Yoweri Museveni and challenger Bobi Wine. Finally, Somalia has accused the UAE of undermining its sovereignty, adding another layer of tension in the Horn of Africa region.</p>
