    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 15, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado announced that she has presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump. Machado did not specify whether Trump accepted the medal. Meanwhile, the US military's Southern Command reported the seizure of a Venezuela-linked oil tanker named Veronica in the Caribbean Sea during a predawn operation described as “without incident.” These developments come amid heightened attention on Venezuela’s political and economic situation.</p>
<p>In Greenland, European military personnel have arrived as France confirmed a small contingent is now present, with more expected soon. This development follows remarks by Donald Trump emphasizing the strategic importance of Greenland for the US.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Conflict Mediation</h2>
<p>The United States has announced the next phase of its Gaza peace plan aimed at ending the ongoing conflict there. However, experts warn that significant challenges stand in the way of successful implementation, highlighting the complexity of the situation on the ground and the need for sustained diplomatic effort.</p>
<h2>Iran Protests and Judiciary</h2>
<p>In Iran, reports from multiple sources indicate that authorities are demanding large sums of money from families in exchange for the return of protesters’ bodies. At the same time, the Iranian judiciary has denied claims that detained protester Erfan Soltani faces execution. While a rights group mentioned that Soltani’s execution has been “postponed,” official statements clarify that he is not charged with a crime that carries the death penalty.</p>
<h2>Afghanistan and Taliban Leadership</h2>
<p>A BBC investigation has brought to light divisions within the top levels of the Taliban. The report reveals conflicts over issues including women’s rights, internet access, and religious interpretation. These internal disagreements trace back to earlier warnings about potential splits within the group’s leadership.</p>
<h2>Uganda Election and Political Tensions</h2>
<p>Vote counting is underway following Uganda’s presidential election, which is a rematch between longtime President Yoweri Museveni and opposition figure Bobi Wine. The opposition alleges voting irregularities, while Museveni has been in power for 40 years. The outcome and its acceptance will be closely watched given Uganda’s political climate.</p>
<h2>Space and Aviation News</h2>
<p>Four astronauts from Crew-11 safely returned to Earth after a medical evacuation from the International Space Station. They appeared in good spirits after their spacecraft touched down.</p>
<p>In aviation safety news, a US safety board report revealed that Boeing was aware of a structural flaw in a part linked to a UPS plane crash in November. The flaw had been identified by Boeing 15 years prior to the accident, raising concerns about aircraft maintenance and oversight.</p>
