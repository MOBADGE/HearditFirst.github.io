    <h2>Tensions and Crackdowns in Iran</h2>
<p>After violent protests in Iran, the killing reportedly "has stopped," according to US President Donald Trump. However, he did not rule out potential military action against Iran amid the unrest. Tehran responded to the situation by temporarily shutting its airspace to nearly all flights. This development signals ongoing tension in the region, with uncertain implications for future diplomatic or military moves.</p>
<h2>Political and Social Divisions in the Taliban</h2>
<p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a significant rift within the Taliban leadership. The divide centers on differing views about women, the internet, and religious policies. These internal disagreements highlight challenges within the group that could affect its governance and stability in Afghanistan moving forward.</p>
<h2>Energy Crisis and Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has declared an energy emergency as the country continues to endure severe cold weather. This move comes amid ongoing conflict with Russia. Meanwhile, President Trump commented that Ukraine is "less ready" than Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a peace deal, underscoring a complex and ongoing geopolitical situation in the region.</p>
<h2>Election Disruptions and Internet Shutdown in Uganda</h2>
<p>Uganda is experiencing widespread delays in its election process, partly due to an internet shutdown. The election is notable as a rematch between Bobi Wine and long-time President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for 40 years. These disruptions have raised concerns about the election's transparency and the impact on democratic processes.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Developments</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot a man in the leg following a car chase. This incident adds to heightened tensions in the city after an agent previously killed Renee Good last week.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the opposition leader Singh was stripped of his title after being convicted for lying to members of parliament, although he maintains his innocence.</p>
<p>Denmark expressed concern about a "fundamental disagreement" after talks with the White House regarding Greenland. President Trump reiterated his interest in acquiring the island, but no major progress was made in the discussions.</p>
<h2>Technology Update: AI and Privacy</h2>
<p>The social media platform X announced it will stop the Grok AI feature that removes clothing from images of real people in places where such actions are illegal. This policy change comes after widespread backlash over privacy and ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated content.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories reflect ongoing international conflicts, political shifts, and emerging debates around technology and governance that shape global affairs today.</p>
