    <h2>International Tensions and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high between the United States and Iran following violent protests in Tehran. US President Donald Trump said the "killing has stopped" after a crackdown but did not rule out possible military action. Meanwhile, Iran temporarily closed its airspace to nearly all flights, signaling ongoing instability. Additionally, a clash within the Taliban leadership over issues such as internet access, women's rights, and religion was revealed by a BBC investigation, highlighting deep divisions at the group's top levels.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Energy Emergency Amid Cold</h2>
<p>Ukraine declared an energy emergency as it deals with continued bitter cold weather affecting the country. This declaration comes at a time when US President Donald Trump commented that Ukraine is "less ready" than Russia’s leader to reach a peace agreement. The energy emergency indicates increasing pressures on Ukraine due to both the weather and the ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest and Internet Blackouts in Africa</h2>
<p>Uganda is experiencing widespread delays in its presidential election caused partly by an internet shutdown. The election is a high-profile contest between the incumbent Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled for 40 years, and challenger Bobi Wine. In another development, Somalia has accused the United Arab Emirates of actions that undermine its sovereignty, further complicating regional relations in East Africa.</p>
<h2>Local Incident in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>An ICE agent shot a man in Minneapolis after an alleged attack. The man was taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. The city authorities confirmed this incident but provided limited details about the circumstances leading up to the shooting.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Greenland, talks between Danish and US officials showed no major breakthrough. Discussions highlighted a "fundamental disagreement," with President Trump reiterating US interest in acquiring the island shortly after the meeting.</p>
<p>On the technology front, X (formerly Twitter) announced that its AI tool, Grok, will no longer allow users to remove clothing from images of real people in places where this is illegal. This change follows public backlash over privacy and ethical concerns.</p>
<p>Finally, an investigation into a factory producing Pop Mart toys accused the company, Labubu, of exploiting workers. The labor group’s findings pointed to serious neglect of staff safety and welfare in the factory’s operations.</p>
<h2>Tragic Train Crash in Thailand</h2>
<p>A severe train crash in Thailand resulted in at least 32 deaths. Rescue teams continued removing victims from the wreckage as the BBC reported from the scene. Witnesses described the aftermath as terrifying, underscoring the devastating impact of the accident on the local community.</p>
