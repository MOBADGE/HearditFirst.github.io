    <h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, said she presented her Nobel medal to Donald Trump. However, she did not clarify whether Trump accepted the medal or what the gesture signifies in the broader political context.</p>
<p>In Uganda, votes are still being counted in a high-profile election that pits Bobi Wine against Yoweri Museveni, who has been president for 40 years. The opposition has alleged rigging in the vote, signaling potential political tensions ahead as the results are finalized.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Protests</h2>
<p>In Iran, multiple sources have reported that security forces are demanding large sums of money from families in exchange for the bodies of protesters killed during demonstrations. Meanwhile, the Iranian judiciary dismissed reports that detained protester Erfan Soltani would face the death penalty, stating he is not charged with any offenses warranting execution. A rights group mentioned the execution has been "postponed," highlighting continuing concerns about treatment of detainees.</p>
<h2>Military Developments</h2>
<p>European military personnel, including a French contingent, have arrived in Greenland as part of ongoing deployments. This comes amid remarks from Donald Trump emphasizing the strategic importance of Greenland to the United States, implying a desire to maintain or increase influence in the region.</p>
<p>The Taliban leadership is reportedly experiencing internal divisions over issues such as attitudes toward women, religious interpretations, and internet access. A BBC investigation revealed tensions among top figures following a period of internet shutdowns in Afghanistan, pointing to an underlying rift that could affect the group's cohesion and governance.</p>
<h2>Space and Safety</h2>
<p>Four astronauts from the Crew-11 mission safely returned to Earth after a medical evacuation from the International Space Station. They were reported to be in good condition and exited their spacecraft with smiles, marking the successful conclusion of an urgent space operation.</p>
<p>Separately, a US safety board reported that Boeing had known for 15 years about a structural flaw in a part linked to a UPS cargo plane crash in November. This revelation may influence ongoing discussions about aviation safety and corporate accountability.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>The US has announced the next phase of its Gaza peace plan aimed at ending ongoing conflict. However, analysts caution that serious challenges lie ahead in implementing the plan, suggesting that progress toward peace may be difficult despite this diplomatic effort.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In Greece, aid workers who had been charged with human trafficking were cleared of all charges. These former volunteers worked for a non-governmental organization that rescues asylum seekers, and their acquittal removes the threat of lengthy jail terms. This decision may affect how humanitarian work is perceived and conducted in migration contexts.</p>
