    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 15, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Tensions</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump commented on the situation in Iran, stating that Iran has "no plan" to execute protesters amid ongoing unrest. However, he did not rule out the possibility of military action. Meanwhile, Iran has temporarily shut its airspace to nearly all flights, indicating heightened tensions and caution.</p>
<p>In talks between the White House and Danish officials, there was no major breakthrough regarding Greenland. Denmark warned of a "fundamental disagreement" after discussions, and President Trump reiterated his interest in acquiring the island shortly afterward. This adds to ongoing diplomatic tensions around Greenland's strategic importance.</p>
<h2>Ukraine's Energy Crisis</h2>
<p>Ukraine has declared a state of emergency in its energy sector as the country endures persistent cold weather. This announcement comes amid comments from President Trump, who said Ukraine is "less ready" than Russia to pursue a peace deal. The energy emergency highlights challenges Ukraine faces during winter amid ongoing conflict and diplomatic strains.</p>
<h2>Tragic Train Accident in Thailand</h2>
<p>A serious train crash in Thailand has resulted in 32 deaths. Rescue crews worked through the evening at the crash site, pulling bodies from the wreckage. Residents described the scene as terrifying, underscoring the tragedy's impact on the local community and the urgent need for investigation and safety improvements.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement Incident in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>An ICE agent shot a man in Minneapolis, hitting him in the leg. The city confirmed the man was taken to the hospital with injuries that are not life-threatening. Details on the circumstances of the shooting remain limited, but the incident has drawn local attention to law enforcement actions and community safety.</p>
<h2>Technology and AI Ethics</h2>
<p>The AI tool Grok, operated by the company X, will no longer allow users to digitally undress images of real people in regions where such actions are illegal. This decision follows public backlash and raises important questions about the ethical use of AI technologies and protecting individual privacy rights.</p>
<h2>Labor Rights Concerns in Manufacturing</h2>
<p>A labor group has accused Labubu, a toy manufacturer producing Pop Mart products, of exploiting workers. Investigators claim the factory neglected staff safety and welfare, raising concerns about labor practices in the industry. This development may prompt calls for better regulatory oversight and protections for factory workers.</p>
<h2>Trade Disputes in Canada</h2>
<p>Two Canadian provinces are in a dispute over the branding and approach to Crown Royal whisky, a product made in Canada but owned by a UK company. This disagreement comes as the whisky faces US tariffs, leading to efforts to form a united "Team Canada" response to protect the industry. The trade dispute highlights challenges Canadian producers face in international markets.</p>
