    <h2>International Tensions and Security</h2>
<p>The situation in Iran remains tense after a violent crackdown on protests, which prompted Tehran to temporarily close its airspace to nearly all flights. The US president said the killing has stopped but did not rule out the possibility of military action. The developments raise concerns about further instability in the region and potential international responses.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Energy Emergency</h2>
<p>Amid ongoing conflict, Ukraine has declared an energy emergency as a harsh cold spell continues to impact the country. This declaration signals serious challenges in maintaining essential services and infrastructure during winter. Meanwhile, the US president commented that Ukraine is "less ready" than the Russian leader to negotiate a peace agreement, adding complexity to diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Greenland Talks Highlight Disagreement</h2>
<p>Denmark expressed a "fundamental disagreement" with the US after recent discussions regarding Greenland's future. The meeting did not result in a major breakthrough, and the US president reiterated interest in acquiring the island. This disagreement underscores underlying tensions between the two countries over strategic and economic interests in the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>Tragic Train Crash in Thailand</h2>
<p>A severe train crash in Thailand has resulted in the deaths of 32 people. Rescue teams were still recovering bodies from the wreckage into the evening. Residents described the scene as terrifying, highlighting the scale of the tragedy and the urgent need for safety reviews in the country’s rail system.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Technology</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, a man was shot in the leg by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent and hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The incident is under public scrutiny as questions about law enforcement conduct continue.</p>
<p>In technology news, the AI platform Grok will no longer allow users to digitally undress images of real people in places where such actions are illegal. This change comes after widespread backlash and reflects growing concerns about ethical use of artificial intelligence and personal privacy.</p>
<h2>Labour and Trade Disputes</h2>
<p>A labour group has accused Labubu, a manufacturer of Pop Mart toys, of exploiting workers by neglecting safety and welfare standards at its factory. The allegations may prompt investigations and increased pressure on companies to improve working conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a trade dispute has emerged between two Canadian provinces over Crown Royal whisky, a UK-owned brand made in Canada. The provinces are testing a united "Team Canada" approach in response to US tariffs, highlighting the challenges faced by Canadian producers in international markets.</p>
