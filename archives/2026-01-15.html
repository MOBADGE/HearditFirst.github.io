    <h2>International Tensions and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high between the United States and Iran as the US president said that the "killing has stopped" following a violent crackdown on protests in Iran. However, he did not rule out the possibility of military action. Meanwhile, Tehran temporarily closed its airspace to nearly all flights, adding to the uncertainty. In Ukraine, the energy situation has worsened due to persistent cold weather, prompting the country's leader to declare an energy emergency. Amid this, the US president commented that Ukraine is "less ready" than Russia to reach a peace agreement.</p>
<h2>Political Developments and Divisions</h2>
<p>A BBC investigation has uncovered internal divisions within the Taliban leadership over key ideological and policy issues, including attitudes toward women, internet access, and religious interpretation. These differences highlight a potential power struggle at the group's top levels. In Greenland, talks between Denmark and the White House concluded without a major breakthrough. The US president reaffirmed his interest in acquiring the island, but Denmark warned of a "fundamental disagreement" over the prospect.</p>
<h2>Elections and Political Controversies</h2>
<p>Uganda is experiencing widespread delays in its election process amid an internet shutdown. The election pits Bobi Wine against long-time president Yoweri Museveni, who has held power for 40 years. In Singapore, the opposition leader Singh was stripped of his title following a conviction for lying to members of parliament, despite maintaining his innocence.</p>
<h2>Incidents and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Authorities in Minneapolis reported an incident where a federal agent shot a man in the leg after the man attacked the agent with a shovel. The Department of Homeland Security said the agent was acting in self-defense. In Thailand, a catastrophic train crash killed 32 people. Rescue operations continued into the evening at the crash site, with authorities pulling victims from the wreckage.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Environmental Impact</h2>
<p>Australia’s state of Victoria faced flash floods causing significant disruption. The Great Ocean Road was closed after aerial footage showed cars being swept away by fast-rising waters. The situation highlights ongoing challenges with extreme weather events affecting infrastructure and communities in the region.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Visits</h2>
<p>Venezuela’s opposition leader is set to meet with the US president at the White House. Ahead of the visit, she offered to share her Nobel prize with him, although details of what she might request in return remain unclear. This meeting marks a notable moment in US-Venezuelan relations.</p>
