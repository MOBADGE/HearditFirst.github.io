    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 15, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Venezuelan opposition figure María Corina Machado said she presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump, though it remains unclear if he accepted it. Meanwhile, French military personnel have deployed to Greenland, with France sending a small contingent and planning to increase forces in the coming days. This move comes as Donald Trump has articulated a strategic interest in the island.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Conflict Resolution</h2>
<p>The US has announced the next phase of its plan to resolve the conflict in Gaza. While this marks progress in diplomatic efforts, experts note that serious challenges could hinder implementation of the peace plan. In Afghanistan, internal divisions within the Taliban leadership are becoming apparent. A BBC investigation highlights clashes over issues such as women's rights, internet access, and religious policies at the highest levels of the group.</p>
<h2>Elections and Political Tensions in Africa</h2>
<p>Vote counting continues in Uganda's presidential election, which pits opposition candidate Bobi Wine against long-standing president Yoweri Museveni, who has held power for 40 years. Opposition supporters have alleged electoral irregularities, raising concerns about the transparency and fairness of the process.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In Iran, reports indicate that security forces are demanding large sums of money from families before releasing the bodies of protesters who died in demonstrations. The Iranian judiciary has denied claims that protester Erfan Soltani is facing execution, stating he is not charged with a capital offense, although a rights group reports his execution was previously postponed. In Greece, aid workers formerly accused of human trafficking have been cleared of all charges. These volunteers had worked with a humanitarian NGO assisting asylum-seekers.</p>
<h2>Science and Safety</h2>
<p>Four astronauts from Crew-11 returned safely to Earth after being medically evacuated from the International Space Station. They appeared in good spirits upon landing. In aviation safety news, a US safety board report revealed that Boeing knew about a structural flaw in a critical aircraft part linked to a recent UPS plane crash. The flaw had been identified by the company 15 years before the November accident. This finding raises ongoing questions about aircraft maintenance and manufacturer accountability.</p>
