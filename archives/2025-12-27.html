    <h2>Southeast Asia Ceasefire After Weeks of Clashes</h2>
<p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to a ceasefire following several weeks of deadly fighting along their border. The conflict, which resumed earlier this month, forced nearly one million people to flee their homes. The ceasefire marks a hopeful step toward stabilizing the region after significant displacement and violence. It remains to be seen how both countries will proceed with peace efforts and ensure the safe return of those affected.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and US Leaders to Discuss War Efforts</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet with US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday to discuss ways to end the ongoing war with Russia. This comes amid renewed Russian air strikes on Kyiv, as reported by the city’s mayor. The meeting is anticipated to focus on diplomatic and strategic options to address the conflict, highlighting continued international involvement in Ukraine’s situation.</p>
<h2>Winter Storm Disrupts US Holiday Travel</h2>
