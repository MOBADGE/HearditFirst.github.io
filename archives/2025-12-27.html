    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s capital Kyiv was hit by a 10-hour missile and drone attack, resulting in two deaths and 32 injuries, according to local authorities. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said this assault demonstrated that Russia does not want peace. Earlier in Southeast Asia, a ceasefire took effect between Thailand and Cambodia after weeks of deadly clashes that displaced nearly one million people. The truce follows an earlier ceasefire that had recently broken down.</p>
<p>In Africa, political contests continue as leaders in Guinea and the Central African Republic seek to consolidate power after elections held Sunday. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, the U.S. military launched strikes against Islamic State targets. Former U.S. official Donald Trump described the attacks as a "Christmas present," which contrasts with statements from Nigerian authorities.</p>
<h2>Crime and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Italian police arrested nine individuals suspected of raising approximately 7 million euros over more than two years for Hamas, a militant group. The arrests highlight ongoing efforts to disrupt financing for armed organizations in Europe.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Natural Events</h2>
<p>Central Greece mourned the loss of four hikers who were found dead following an avalanche that occurred on Christmas Day. Search teams had been trying to locate three men and one woman reported missing during the severe winter weather. In Japan, a major highway crash involving around 50 vehicles left two people dead and 26 others injured. The pile-up happened in central Japan under conditions that have not been detailed.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Trends</h2>
<p>There is a growing presence of artificial intelligence in social media influencing. One recent story contrasted two successful social media influencers—one of whom is a human and the other an AI creation. This development has sparked debate about whether AI is undermining traditional celebrity or providing new opportunities for a broader range of people to gain online popularity.</p>
<h2>Science and Environment</h2>
<p>A spectacular meteor was visible in the night sky over Mount Fuji in Japan, drawing attention for its bright blaze. Videos captured by observers show the meteor as it streaked across the sky, offering a rare and striking natural event for viewers in the region.</p>
