    <h2>Southeast Asia Ceasefire Reached</h2>
<p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to a ceasefire following weeks of deadly clashes that began earlier this month. The violence has forced nearly one million people to flee their homes, causing a significant humanitarian crisis. The ceasefire presents a crucial step toward stabilizing the region, though the long-term resolution of tensions will require further diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and U.S. Leaders to Discuss War</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet with former U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday to discuss ways to end the ongoing conflict with Russia. This comes as Kyiv’s mayor reported new Russian air strikes on the Ukrainian capital, highlighting the continued instability and urgency for diplomatic dialogue in the region.</p>
<h2>Winter Storm Disrupts U.S. Air Travel</h2>
<p>Thousands of flights across the United States have been disrupted due to a severe winter storm expected to bring heavy snow to the New York area and southern Connecticut. The timing is particularly challenging as it coincides with one of the country's busiest travel weekends, potentially causing widespread delays and cancellations affecting holiday travelers. Airlines and passengers are preparing for ongoing disruptions as the storm progresses.</p>
