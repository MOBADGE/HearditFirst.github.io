    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, endured a lengthy 10-hour missile and drone attack that killed two people and injured 32, according to local authorities. Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, said this attack demonstrates that Russia “doesn’t want peace,” highlighting ongoing tensions in the region. Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia, Thailand and Cambodia have initiated a ceasefire following weeks of deadly clashes that displaced nearly one million people. The resumption of hostilities earlier this month had shattered the first truce, and the new ceasefire offers hope for reducing violence and addressing the humanitarian crisis.</p>
<h2>International Security Actions</h2>
<p>In Africa, the United States conducted airstrikes targeting the Islamic State in Nigeria. Former US President Donald Trump stated that he ordered the strikes as “a Christmas present,” which contradicts official statements from Nigerian authorities about the timing and intent. In Italy, authorities arrested nine people accused of raising about €7 million (£6 million) over more than two years to support the militant group Hamas. These events reflect ongoing global efforts to counter militant organizations across different regions.</p>
<h2>Transportation and Accidents</h2>
<p>Severe winter weather in New York has disrupted travel considerably, with hundreds of flights cancelled and over 3,000 delayed due to heavy snowfall. The storm caused widespread chaos, affecting holiday travel plans. In Greece, four hikers—three men and one woman—were found dead after an avalanche in central parts of the country. Rescue teams had launched a search operation after the hikers went missing on Christmas Day. In Japan, a 50-vehicle pile-up on a highway in the central region resulted in two deaths and 26 injuries, underscoring the dangers on winter roads.</p>
<h2>Politics in Africa</h2>
<p>Elections held recently in Guinea and the Central African Republic feature two main contenders: a general and a mathematician. Both leaders seek to strengthen their hold on power following Sunday’s polls. The outcomes could influence political stability and governance in these African countries as they navigate post-election challenges.</p>
<h2>Technology and Culture</h2>
<p>Social media now features influencers whose popularity includes both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) avatars. This development raises debates about AI’s role: some worry it might undermine social media’s authenticity, while others believe it could democratize fame and make online influence more accessible. Separately, a meteor was seen lighting up the night sky over Japan’s iconic Mount Fuji, a natural spectacle witnessed and shared widely.</p>
