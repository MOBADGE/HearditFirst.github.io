    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 27, 2025</div>
    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, a recent large-scale Russian attack has left about a third of residents in Kyiv without heating amid freezing weather. This disruption affects thousands of people in the capital, raising concerns over their safety and well-being during harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, a ceasefire has started between Thailand and Cambodia after weeks of deadly clashes. The fighting had forced nearly one million people to flee their homes when hostilities resumed earlier this month following a prior truce. This new ceasefire aims to ease tensions and provide relief to those displaced.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the US has launched military strikes targeting Islamic State militants. While Nigerian officials made a particular statement about the timing, former US President Trump told Politico he authorized the strikes as "a Christmas present," indicating political significance in the timing of the action.</p>
<h2>Crime and Legal Actions</h2>
<p>Italian authorities arrested nine people accused of raising approximately €7 million (£6 million) for Hamas over more than two years. The investigation highlights ongoing concerns over financing for militant groups in Europe.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>Central Greece mourns four hikers found dead after an avalanche that occurred on Christmas Day. Search and rescue operations were conducted following the disappearance of three men and one woman.</p>
<p>In central Japan, a major traffic crash involving 50 vehicles left two people dead and 26 injured. The pileup on a highway has raised safety and emergency response concerns amid winter driving conditions.</p>
<h2>Weather and Travel Disruptions</h2>
<p>A severe winter storm has brought heavy snowfall to New York, causing widespread travel chaos. Hundreds of flights have been canceled, and more than 3,000 planes were delayed as the city copes with the impact on transportation.</p>
<h2>Science and Society</h2>
<p>In Japan, a meteor was visible streaking across the night sky above Mount Fuji, providing a rare and striking natural spectacle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, debates continue over the role of artificial intelligence in social media. Some criticize AI for disrupting traditional pathways to online fame, while others believe it offers new opportunities for a broader range of people to gain recognition as influencers.</p>
