    <h2>International Security Developments</h2>
<p>The United States and the United Kingdom are withdrawing some personnel from their military base in Qatar as a precautionary measure. This move occurs amid ongoing tensions related to Iran, with President Donald Trump reportedly considering possible actions against the country. These developments reflect growing concerns over regional stability in the Middle East and could influence future diplomatic and military engagements.</p>
<h2>Middle East Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>The US government announced the launch of the second phase of its Gaza peace plan. According to US envoy Steve Witkoff, this phase focuses on establishing a technocratic Palestinian government, as well as the reconstruction and demilitarisation of Gaza. This plan aims to reduce conflict in the region and promote long-term stability, though details on implementation and international support remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>Iran Internet Shutdown and Starlink</h2>
<p>Following a government internet shutdown in Iran last week, the satellite internet service Starlink has reportedly been made available for free in the country. This technology has become a vital communication lifeline for protesters who face significant personal risks while using it. The situation highlights ongoing unrest in Iran and the increasing reliance on alternative communication methods during times of censorship.</p>
<h2>Immigration Policy Changes</h2>
<p>The Trump administration has announced a pause on immigrant visa processing for nationals from 75 countries, effective from 21 January. The policy targets individuals who are deemed likely to rely on welfare and public benefits. This pause signifies a continued tightening of US immigration policies and could have significant effects on immigration flows and international relations with the affected countries.</p>
<h2>Major Accident in Thailand</h2>
<p>A crane collapse in Thailand has resulted in at least 32 deaths and left 64 others injured, including very young and elderly individuals. The incident caused significant casualties, raising concerns about safety standards and emergency response measures at construction and transportation sites. Authorities will likely investigate the cause to prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Italy, influencer Chiara Ferragni was cleared of accusations related to misleading consumers in her promotions of holiday cakes and Easter eggs. Elsewhere, the White House defended former President Trump after he made a middle-finger gesture at a heckler during a visit to a Ford factory in Michigan. The heckler stated he has "no regrets" about the incident.</p>
<p>Additionally, Swiss regions have banned pyrotechnics following a ski bar fire believed to have been caused by sparklers attached to champagne bottles igniting ceiling foam. In the US, the FBI searched the home of a Washington Post journalist in connection with a classified documents investigation involving a federal contractor who has been arrested.</p>
<p>Finally, in sports, amateur tennis player Jordan Smith stunned the field by winning the A$1 million Million Dollar One Point Slam at the Australian Open, including a victory over reigning men's champion Jannik Sinner. This unexpected win has drawn significant attention in the tennis world.</p>
