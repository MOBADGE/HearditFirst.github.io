    <h2>Iran Protests and Reported Death Toll</h2>
<p>Protests have continued in Iran over the past 17 days, with a US-based organization, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), reporting that 1,850 protesters have been killed. These events highlight ongoing unrest and widespread dissent within the country, though exact details and the government's response remain limited in the report.</p>
<h2>International Reactions</h2>
<p>In response to the unrest, former US President Donald Trump commented that "help is on its way" for those involved in the Iran protests. This statement signals continued international attention and potential future involvement or support, although specific actions or plans have not been detailed.</p>
<h2>Context and Outlook</h2>
<p>The high number of reported casualties marks a significant humanitarian concern and may influence diplomatic relations with Iran. The protest movement's persistence indicates a volatile situation that could affect regional stability and prompt further international engagement.</p>
