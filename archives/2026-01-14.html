    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The United States and the United Kingdom are withdrawing some military personnel from their base in Qatar as a precautionary measure. This move comes amid heightened tensions related to Iran, with former US President Donald Trump considering possible actions. Meanwhile, the US has launched the second phase of its peace plan for Gaza, proposing a new technocratic Palestinian government alongside rebuilding efforts and plans to demilitarize the region. US envoy Steve Witkoff emphasized these steps are part of ongoing efforts to stabilize the area.</p>
<h2>Middle East Communications and Protests</h2>
<p>In Iran, after the government imposed an internet shutdown last week, the satellite internet service Starlink has reportedly been made free to help maintain communication. Many protesters are now using the service to stay connected, though this carries significant risks due to government restrictions and surveillance. Starlink has become a crucial tool in supporting civil communication under these challenging conditions.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy Update</h2>
<p>The US government announced a pause in immigrant visa processing for nationals from 75 countries starting January 21. The pause targets individuals who are assessed as likely to rely on welfare or public benefits, signaling a change in immigration policy focused on economic self-sufficiency. This move could affect many seeking to immigrate to the US and may impact the flow of applications in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Major Accident in Thailand</h2>
<p>A tragic accident occurred in Thailand when a crane collapsed onto a train, resulting in at least 32 deaths and 64 injuries. Victims range widely in age, including a one-year-old child and an 85-year-old adult. The incident has drawn attention to safety concerns and will likely prompt investigations into construction and transport safety standards in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Developments</h2>
<p>Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni was cleared of allegations that she misled consumers in promotional campaigns for seasonal cakes and Easter eggs. In the US, a controversy unfolded when former President Trump made a middle-finger gesture at a heckler, who was subsequently suspended from his job at Ford. The heckler has received nearly $700,000 in donations from supporters. Additionally, the FBI searched the home of a Washington Post reporter amid a classified documents investigation, with authorities accusing the journalist of handling leaked information.</p>
<h2>Sports Highlight</h2>
<p>At the Australian Open tennis tournament, amateur Jordan Smith made headlines by winning the Million Dollar One Point Slam event. Smith's victory was notable for defeating the reigning men's champion, Jannik Sinner, marking a significant upset in the competition and earning a prize of A$1 million.</p>
