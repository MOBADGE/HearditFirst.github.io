    <h2>International Concerns Over Iran Protests</h2>
<p>The death toll from protests in Iran has reportedly surpassed 2,400, with relatives of an arrested protester expecting his execution imminently. Former US President Donald Trump has warned of taking "very strong action" if Iranian authorities proceed with executions of protesters. This situation highlights ongoing tensions and raises questions about international responses to human rights concerns in Iran.</p>
<h2>Arctic Summit Talks in Greenland</h2>
<p>US Vice President JD Vance will host Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers for a summit focused on the future of the Arctic region. The talks, scheduled for Wednesday, will address strategic and environmental issues affecting Greenland and the broader Arctic. The summit’s outcomes could influence regional cooperation and the international approach to Arctic governance amid climate change.</p>
<h2>Energy Crisis and Cold in Kyiv</h2>
<p>Kyiv faces severe hardships as Russian attacks intensify an ongoing energy crisis in the Ukrainian capital. Residents are contending with power and water outages amidst temperatures plunging to -19°C, making it difficult to stay warm. This situation spotlights the growing humanitarian challenges linked to the conflict and infrastructure damage in Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Advances and Challenges in Global AI and Climate</h2>
<p>The United States has approved the sale of Nvidia's advanced artificial intelligence chips to China, reflecting ongoing competition between the two countries for AI technology leadership. Meanwhile, scientists reported that global temperatures dipped slightly in 2025. However, they caution that the last three years were the hottest on record, and more heat records are expected due to continued carbon emissions. These developments underscore tensions in technology policy and the ongoing challenges posed by climate change.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic and Cultural Engagements in Asia and Beyond</h2>
<p>In East Asia, leaders of Japan and South Korea concluded their summit with a cultural moment, performing a K-pop drum duet to songs by BTS and the group KPop Demon Hunters. This symbolic act followed talks aiming to strengthen ties between the two nations. Separately, South Korea is experiencing a surge in popularity for a Dubai-inspired chocolate dessert, driving rapid sales and increasing ingredient prices. Additionally, Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney is visiting China to deepen trade relations and repair diplomatic ties while carefully navigating security concerns and US-China tensions.</p>
