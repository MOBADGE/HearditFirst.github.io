    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Tensions around the world remain high, with several developments drawing international attention. Former US President Donald Trump has warned of "very strong action" if Iran proceeds with the execution of protesters, amid reports that the death toll from recent demonstrations in Iran has surpassed 2,400. Meanwhile, Poland’s Karol Nawrocki called on Europe to support Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine, asserting that only Trump can stop Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>In the Arctic region, US Vice President JD Vance is preparing to host Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers for talks that could significantly shape the future of the Arctic, an area gaining strategic importance due to climate change and natural resources.</p>
<h2>Economy and Trade</h2>
<p>China announced a record trade surplus of $1.19 trillion for 2025, marking the largest ever reported. This milestone comes despite ongoing tariffs imposed under former President Trump’s administration. Beijing attributes the surplus to diversifying its trade partnerships, underlining China’s significant position in the global economy.</p>
<p>In a related technological and economic development, the US has approved the sale of Nvidia’s advanced artificial intelligence chips to China. This decision occurs amid growing competition between the two nations for dominance in AI technology, reflecting the complex dynamics of global tech markets.</p>
<h2>Environment and Climate</h2>
<p>Scientists have reported that global temperatures slightly dipped in 2025, after three consecutive years of record-breaking heat. Despite the temporary decline, experts warn that more temperature records are likely as human carbon emissions continue to contribute to global warming. This ongoing trend highlights the persistent challenges countries face in addressing climate change.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Crisis Updates</h2>
<p>Kyiv is experiencing worsening conditions as Russian strikes deepen an energy crisis; the city suffers from power outages, lack of water, and harsh cold weather dropping to -19°C. Residents are struggling to keep warm and maintain basic services amidst the ongoing conflict.</p>
<p>In a positive note amidst international tensions, Venezuela has released some American citizens from prison. While a US State Department official did not specify the details or numbers involved, the move was described as "an important step in the right direction" for improving relations.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>In an unusual diplomatic moment blending culture with politics, the leaders of Japan and South Korea performed a K-pop drum duet featuring hits from BTS and KPop Demon Hunters, concluding summit talks. This performance symbolizes a cultural bridge amid complex regional relations.</p>
<p>Separately, actor Kiefer Sutherland, known for his roles in "24" and "Designated Survivor," was arrested early Monday morning in Hollywood for an alleged assault involving a ride-share driver. Investigations are ongoing.</p>
