    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>The United States and the United Kingdom are withdrawing some personnel from their military base in Qatar as a precaution, amid concerns over possible actions against Iran. This move occurs while former US president Donald Trump contemplates potential responses related to Iran. Meanwhile, in Gaza, the US has launched the second phase of its peace plan. According to US envoy Steve Witkoff, this stage involves forming a technocratic Palestinian government, alongside initiatives to reconstruct Gaza and pursue its demilitarisation. These steps indicate ongoing international efforts to stabilize the region.</p>
<h2>Iran Internet Shutdown and Communications</h2>
<p>In response to the Iranian government's decision to shut down the internet last week, Starlink satellite internet service reportedly became available for free in Iran. This technology is now a vital communications lifeline for protesters, although using it carries significant risks. The availability of Starlink highlights the increasing role of satellite internet in maintaining connectivity during government-imposed blackouts.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy Update</h2>
<p>The US administration announced a pause on immigrant visa processing for 75 countries starting January 21. The policy aims to bar foreign nationals who might become reliant on welfare and public benefits in the United States. This measure represents a continued tightening of immigration controls and may affect many prospective immigrants from a broad range of countries.</p>
<h2>Accident in Thailand</h2>
<p>A crane collapse in Thailand resulted in at least 32 deaths and injured 64 people, including very young and elderly victims—a one-year-old and an 85-year-old among them. The incident underscores concerns about construction safety and infrastructure management in the region. Authorities are likely to investigate the cause and implement measures to prevent similar tragedies.</p>
<h2>Domestic and Legal News in the US and Europe</h2>
<p>In the United States, the FBI searched the home of a Washington Post reporter as part of an ongoing investigation into classified documents. Attorney General Bondi accused the journalist of publishing classified information allegedly leaked by a federal contractor, who has reportedly been arrested. In a separate incident, the White House defended former US president Donald Trump following his middle-finger gesture at a heckler during a Michigan factory visit. The individual who heckled Trump says he has no regrets about the confrontation.</p>
<p>In Italy, influencer Chiara Ferragni was cleared of accusations of misleading consumers concerning her promotion of Christmas cakes and Easter eggs. This decision resolves a case involving advertising ethics within the influencer industry.</p>
<h2>Sports Highlight</h2>
<p>At the Australian Open, amateur tennis player Jordan Smith secured a surprising victory in the Million Dollar One Point Slam tournament. Smith defeated some of the world’s top players, including reigning men's champion Jannik Sinner, and won a prize of A$1 million. This unexpected result has caught the attention of the tennis world and fans alike.</p>
<h2>Safety Measures in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Following a fire at a ski bar believed to have been caused by sparklers attached to champagne bottles igniting foam ceiling padding, Swiss regions have imposed bans on pyrotechnics. This preventative action aims to reduce the risk of similar fires in public venues during festive occasions and reflects growing caution about pyrotechnic use.</p>
