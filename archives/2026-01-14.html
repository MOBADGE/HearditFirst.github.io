    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>The United States and the United Kingdom have moved some of their personnel out of a military base in Qatar. U.S. officials described this as a "precautionary measure," amid growing tensions as former U.S. leader Donald Trump considers potential actions against Iran. Meanwhile, the U.S. has launched the second phase of its peace plan for Gaza. This phase involves establishing a technocratic Palestinian government and efforts toward rebuilding and demilitarizing Gaza. The U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff outlined these steps as part of a broader strategy to stabilize the region.</p>
<h2>Iran Protests and Internet Access</h2>
<p>In response to recent protests in Iran and the government’s shutdown of the internet, satellite internet service Starlink has reportedly been made free in the country. This technology has become a crucial communications lifeline for protesters, though it carries significant risks for users due to government restrictions. The availability of Starlink aims to help Iranians maintain communication despite the official internet blackout.</p>
<h2>U.S. Immigration Policy Update</h2>
<p>The Trump administration has announced a pause on immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries, effective from 21 January. The policy is intended to prevent foreign nationals who might rely on welfare and public benefits from entering the U.S. This move represents a significant change in immigration enforcement and will likely affect many applicants from diverse countries worldwide.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accident in Thailand</h2>
<p>At least 32 people were killed when a crane collapsed onto a train in Thailand. The accident also injured 64 individuals, including a one-year-old child and an 85-year-old adult. Officials are investigating the cause of the collapse. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about infrastructure safety and public transport security in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Updates</h2>
<p>Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni has been cleared of allegations related to misleading consumers about Christmas cakes and Easter eggs. In the United States, the White House defended Donald Trump after he made a middle-finger gesture at a heckler. The person targeted by the gesture was suspended from his job, receiving nearly $700,000 in donations from supporters. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, several regions have banned pyrotechnics following a fire at a ski bar believed to be caused by sparklers attached to champagne bottles igniting foam ceiling padding.</p>
<h2>Sports Highlight</h2>
<p>In sports, amateur tennis player Jordan Smith stunned the field to win the Million Dollar One Point Slam event at the Australian Open. Smith’s victory included a notable win over the reigning men's champion, Jannik Sinner. Smith earned a prize of A$1 million, marking a remarkable achievement for an amateur in a major tennis competition.</p>
