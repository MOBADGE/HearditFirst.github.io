    <h2>Middle East Protests and International Response</h2>
<p>The situation in Iran remains tense as the death toll from ongoing protests reportedly exceeds 2,400. Relatives of one arrested protester have said he is scheduled to be executed on Wednesday. In response, Donald Trump has pledged “very strong action” if Iran goes ahead with such executions. This development underscores international concern over human rights and the potential for further unrest in Iran. The coming days may see heightened diplomatic pressure and possible consequences depending on Iran’s actions.</p>
<h2>Tragic Crane Collapse in Thailand</h2>
<p>A crane collapsed onto a train in Thailand, killing at least 32 people and injuring 64 others, including very young and elderly victims. The incident has raised questions about safety standards and infrastructure oversight in the country. Authorities are likely to investigate the cause in the coming days, while support and medical care for the injured continue. This tragedy is a severe blow to local communities and highlights risks associated with construction near transportation routes.</p>
<h2>Arctic Summit and Geopolitical Talks</h2>
<p>In the Arctic region, U.S. Vice President JD Vance is set to host discussions with Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers. The summit aims to shape the future of the Arctic, a region of growing strategic and environmental importance. Greenlanders are watching closely, as decisions made could significantly impact their environment, economy, and autonomy. This meeting reflects the increasing global focus on Arctic policies amid climate change and international interest.</p>
<h2>China’s Record Trade Surplus</h2>
<p>China has announced a record trade surplus of $1.19 trillion despite facing U.S. tariffs introduced during Donald Trump’s administration. The country has diversified its trade partnerships, allowing it to achieve this milestone. This development indicates China’s continuing strength in global trade and could influence future economic policies and negotiations between China, the U.S., and other countries.</p>
<h2>Political Tensions in Uganda</h2>
<p>Tensions have risen in Uganda over the upcoming election results. The election chief has reported receiving threats related to the declaration of results. This follows a statement by a presidential assistant suggesting that opposition candidate Bobi Wine would not be declared president, regardless of the vote outcome. These developments raise concerns about electoral fairness and political stability in the country.</p>
<h2>Russia Faces Baby Deaths Investigation</h2>
<p>In Siberia, Russia, doctors have been arrested after the deaths of nine newborn babies in a maternity hospital during the extended New Year holiday period. This shocking event has prompted investigations into hospital conditions and medical practices. The case may lead to broader scrutiny of healthcare facilities in the region.</p>
