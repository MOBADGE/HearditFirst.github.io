    <h2>Iran Internet Access Amid Protests</h2>
<p>Starlink, the satellite internet service, has reportedly been made free in Iran following the government's shutdown of the internet last week. This service has become a crucial communication tool for protesters amid ongoing unrest. However, using Starlink in Iran carries significant risks for individuals, as the government continues to crack down on dissent. The technology offers a rare way to bypass government restrictions, but those relying on it face potential dangers due to the tense political environment.</p>
<h2>Tragic Crane Accident in Thailand</h2>
<p>A crane collapse on a train in Thailand has resulted in the deaths of at least 32 people, with 64 others injured, including a one-year-old child and an 85-year-old adult. The incident has raised concerns about safety regulations and infrastructure maintenance. Emergency services are managing the response, but the high number of casualties highlights the severity of the accident and the urgent need for investigation to prevent future occurrences.</p>
<h2>US Advances Gaza Peace Plan</h2>
<p>The United States has launched the second phase of its Gaza peace plan, introducing a technocratic Palestinian government as part of the effort. US envoy Steve Witkoff described plans for reconstruction and demilitarisation of Gaza under this new framework. The move signals a continued American commitment to resolving tensions in the region through structured political and infrastructural reforms, though the response from regional stakeholders remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>FBI Searches Washington Post Reporter’s Home</h2>
<p>The FBI has searched the home of a Washington Post journalist in connection with a probe into reported classified information leaks. Attorney General Bondi accused the reporter of publishing material obtained from a federal contractor who has been arrested. This development highlights ongoing tensions between the government and the press regarding the handling of sensitive information and national security concerns.</p>
<h2>Sports Highlight: Amateur Wins Million Dollar Tennis Slam</h2>
<p>In a surprising upset, amateur tennis player Jordan Smith won the Million Dollar One Point Slam at the Australian Open, defeating top players including the reigning men's champion, Jannik Sinner. Smith's unexpected victory not only earned him a substantial prize of A$1 million but also brought fresh excitement to the tennis world as he demonstrated remarkable skill against the sport’s elite competitors.</p>
<h2>Other News in Brief</h2>
<p>Several Swiss regions have banned pyrotechnics after a ski bar fire, believed to have been started by sparklers on champagne bottles igniting foam ceiling padding. In Uganda, the election chief reported receiving threats linked to controversy over presidential election results, following statements that the opposition candidate Bobi Wine might not be declared president even if victorious. Meanwhile, Los Angeles has opened a ticket lottery for the 2028 Olympic Games, with prices starting at $28 and notifications of successful entries scheduled for April.</p>
<p>Lastly, Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni was cleared of accusations that she misled consumers in marketing Christmas cakes and Easter eggs, resolving a consumer protection case. Also, the White House defended former President Trump over a recent middle-finger gesture towards a heckler, amid significant public attention and raised donations supporting the suspended individual.</p>
