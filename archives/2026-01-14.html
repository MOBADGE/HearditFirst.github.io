    <h2>Communications in Iran Amid Internet Shutdown</h2>
<p>Starlink satellite internet service has reportedly been made available for free in Iran following a government internet shutdown last week. The technology is serving as a crucial means for protesters and citizens to communicate despite official restrictions. However, using Starlink carries significant risks for users, who face possible detection and consequences from authorities while trying to maintain access to information and coordination tools.</p>
<h2>Deadly Crane Collapse in Thailand</h2>
<p>A crane collapse on a train in Thailand has killed at least 32 people and injured 64 others, including very young and elderly passengers. The crash has raised concerns over construction safety and transport regulations in the country. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, while emergency services continue treating those affected.</p>
<h2>US Advances Gaza Peace Plan</h2>
<p>The United States has launched the second phase of its Gaza peace initiative. This plan involves setting up a technocratic Palestinian government designed to oversee Gaza’s reconstruction and demilitarisation. US envoy Steve Witkoff emphasized the plan's goal to create a stable governance structure in Gaza, which could impact the region's long-running conflicts and future diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>FBI Searches Washington Post Reporter’s Home</h2>
<p>The FBI conducted a search of a Washington Post reporter’s home as part of an investigation into classified information leaks. Attorney General Bondi accused the journalist of publishing classified information allegedly leaked by a federal contractor, who has since been arrested. This development highlights ongoing tensions around press freedom and government transparency in handling sensitive information.</p>
<h2>Major Sports Upset at Australian Open</h2>
<p>Amateur tennis player Jordan Smith pulled off a surprising victory at the Australian Open’s Million Dollar One Point Slam tournament. Smith defeated some of the world’s top players, including reigning men's champion Jannik Sinner, to claim the $1 million prize. This upset has generated significant attention in the tennis community and showcases emerging talent on the global stage.</p>
<h2>Ticket Sales Open for 2028 Los Angeles Olympics</h2>
<p>Los Angeles has opened a ticket lottery for the 2028 Summer Olympics, offering seats starting at $28. Fans who enter the drawing will be notified by email if selected and given a set time in April to complete their purchase. This marks an early step in preparations for the upcoming Games and aims to provide broad access to attendees.</p>
