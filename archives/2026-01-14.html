    <h2>International Protests and Political Tensions</h2>
<p>The death toll in Iran's ongoing protests has reportedly surpassed 2,400, with relatives of detained protesters warning that executions are imminent. One arrested protester is reportedly scheduled for execution this Wednesday. In response, former US President Donald Trump has pledged to take "very strong action" if Iran proceeds with executing demonstrators. Meanwhile, the Polish president Karol Nawrocki emphasized to the BBC that only Trump can influence Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, urging European support for Trump’s efforts in this regard. In Uganda, tensions rise as the election chief revealed he has received threats linked to the declaration of the presidential election results. This follows statements from a presidential assistant suggesting that opposition candidate Bobi Wine may be blocked from being declared president even if he wins.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Public Safety</h2>
<p>A deadly accident in Thailand occurred when a crane collapsed onto a passing train, killing at least 32 people and injuring 64, including both very young and elderly victims. In Russia, an alarming incident at a Siberian maternity hospital resulted in the deaths of nine newborn babies over the New Year holiday period. Following the tragedy, several doctors from the hospital have been arrested as authorities investigate the circumstances behind the newborn deaths.</p>
<h2>Arctic Talks and Global Trade</h2>
<p>The Arctic region’s future is the focus of upcoming discussions hosted by US Vice President JD Vance. On Wednesday, Vance will meet with Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers to hold talks that are expected to address issues related to the Arctic’s environment and geopolitical importance. Meanwhile, China reported its largest-ever trade surplus of $1.19 trillion, despite earlier tariffs imposed by Trump’s administration. Beijing attributed this record surplus to diversified trade partnerships.</p>
<h2>Sports Highlights</h2>
<p>In a surprising upset at the Australian Open, amateur tennis player Jordan Smith won the Million Dollar One Point Slam, taking home A$1 million. Smith’s victory was remarkable as he defeated the reigning men's champion, Jannik Sinner, among others. This achievement has caught considerable attention in the sporting world.</p>
<h2>Culture and Events</h2>
<p>Author Colleen Hoover, known for her bestseller *It Ends With Us*, shared positive news about her health, revealing that she has undergone successful cancer surgery and continues to improve following radiotherapy treatments. On a different note, preparations for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are underway, with officials announcing that a ticket lottery system will open soon. Fans can enter for a chance to purchase seats starting at $28, with winners being notified by email in the spring and given a time window to complete their purchases.</p>
