    <h2>International Communications</h2>
<p>Satellite internet service Starlink has reportedly been made available for free in Iran amid widespread government internet shutdowns. This technology has emerged as an important communication tool for protesters facing restrictions online. However, using Starlink carries significant risks due to government crackdowns on unauthorized internet access. The service is providing a critical lifeline but also exposing users to potential penalties.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accident in Thailand</h2>
<p>A crane collapsed onto a train in Thailand, resulting in at least 32 fatalities and injuring 64 people, including a one-year-old child and an 85-year-old adult. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about infrastructure safety and accident prevention in the region. Authorities are investigating the circumstances of the collapse as emergency responders continue to assist those affected.</p>
<h2>Middle East Peace Initiative</h2>
<p>The US has launched the second phase of its peace plan for Gaza, introducing a technocratic Palestinian government. Key components of the proposal include the reconstruction of Gaza and its demilitarisation, according to US envoy Steve Witkoff. This development represents a renewed diplomatic effort aimed at stabilizing the region, although the plan’s success will depend on cooperation from local stakeholders.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Updates</h2>
<p>In Italy, influencer Chiara Ferragni has been cleared of allegations of misleading consumers regarding her promotion of festive baked goods, including Christmas cakes and Easter eggs. Meanwhile, in the United States, the White House defended a former president’s use of a middle-finger gesture toward a heckler. The heckler, who was suspended from his job at Ford, has received nearly $700,000 in donations from supporters.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, several regions have banned pyrotechnics following a fire at a ski bar caused by sparklers attached to champagne bottles igniting foam padding. In the United States, the FBI searched the home of a Washington Post reporter as part of a probe into classified document leaks. Lastly, preparations for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics continue with the opening of a ticket lottery, offering seats starting at $28 and notifications planned for April.</p>
