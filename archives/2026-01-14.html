    <h2>Communications and Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>In Iran, satellite internet service Starlink has reportedly been made available for free following the government's shutdown of the national internet last week. This technology has become a crucial communication tool for protesters. However, using Starlink carries significant risks, as the Iranian authorities are likely to crack down on those accessing the outside world through these satellite connections. The availability of Starlink highlights the ongoing tension and the lengths people will go to maintain communication amid government restrictions.</p>
<h2>US and Denmark Disagree Over Greenland</h2>
<p>Diplomatic talks between the US and Denmark concerning Greenland have signaled a "fundamental disagreement," according to Danish officials. The meeting failed to reach a major breakthrough, with the US reiterating its interest in acquiring the island shortly after discussions ended. This issue remains a sensitive point between the two countries, with implications for regional security and sovereignty debates.</p>
<h2>Tragic Crane Collapse in Thailand</h2>
<p>A crane collapse onto a train in Thailand has resulted in at least 32 deaths and left 64 people injured, including both the very young and elderly. The incident is one of the deadliest recent accidents in the country and raises questions about construction safety standards and emergency response measures. Authorities are investigating the cause of the collapse as they work to assist survivors and families of the victims.</p>
<h2>Changes in US Immigration Policy</h2>
<p>The US government announced it will pause immigrant visa processing for nationals from 75 countries starting January 21. The policy targets foreign nationals perceived as likely to rely on welfare or public benefits. This move is part of the administration’s broader efforts to tighten immigration controls and could impact many applicants waiting for visas from affected countries, shaping future migration and community demographics in the US.</p>
<h2>New Phase of Gaza Peace Plan</h2>
<p>The United States has launched the second phase of its Gaza peace plan, which includes forming a technocratic Palestinian government and efforts toward the reconstruction and demilitarization of Gaza. US envoy Steve Witkoff described the plan as aiming for stability and improved governance in the region. Whether this approach will lead to lasting peace depends on cooperation from regional parties and the Palestinian leadership.</p>
<h2>FBI Investigation Involving Washington Post Reporter</h2>
<p>The FBI has searched the home of a Washington Post reporter as part of a probe into classified documents. Attorney General Bondi accused the journalist of reporting on secret information allegedly leaked by a federal contractor, who has reportedly been arrested. This development intensifies scrutiny on media outlets and their role in handling sensitive government information and raises concerns about press freedoms.</p>
<h2>Sports Highlight: Unexpected Tennis Victory</h2>
<p>Amateur tennis player Jordan Smith has surprised the sports world by winning the Million Dollar One Point Slam at the Australian Open. Smith defeated reigning men's champion Jannik Sinner on the way to taking home the A$1 million prize. His victory is seen as a remarkable achievement in professional tennis, spotlighting fresh talent on a major stage.</p>
