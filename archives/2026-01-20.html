    <h2>US-EU Tensions Over Greenland Tariffs</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his commitment to imposing tariffs on Greenland, saying he will follow through "100%." This move escalates tensions with the European Union, whose foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, responded by saying the EU does not seek conflict but will defend its interests. The dispute highlights ongoing challenges in transatlantic relations since President Trump took office. Experts suggest that for Europe to effectively address the situation with the US, unity among EU members will be essential.</p>
<h2>Spain Mourns After Deadly Train Collision</h2>
<p>Spain is observing three days of national mourning following a tragic high-speed train crash in the country’s south. At least 40 people lost their lives in the collision, marking the worst train accident in Spain in over ten years. Investigations into the causes of the crash are ongoing. The mourning period allows the nation to come together in grief and pay respects to the victims and their families.</p>
<h2>Series of Shark Attacks Raises Warnings in Australia</h2>
<p>Authorities in an Australian state have issued safety warnings after a fourth shark attack in 48 hours injured a surfer. Officials advised the public to avoid entering waterways, especially following recent rainfall which may have increased shark activity near shorelines. The situation is being monitored closely to prevent further incidents, and local communities are urged to exercise caution.</p>
<h2>Heavy Snow Causes Major Multi-Vehicle Crash in US</h2>
<p>In Ottawa County, Michigan, severe winter weather led to a large pile-up involving over 100 vehicles on a motorway. Jack-knifed trucks blocked multiple lanes, creating hazardous conditions and significant traffic disruption. Emergency services responded to clear the wreckage and assist those affected. Motorists in the region are advised to remain cautious and prepared for challenging driving conditions during ongoing snowfalls.</p>
<h2>Cultural Remembrances in Nigeria and San Francisco</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, the community has laid to rest Kasali Akangbe Ogun, a master wood carver dedicated to preserving local artistic traditions. Ogun’s passing marks the loss of an important cultural figure who continued a family legacy in wood carving.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in San Francisco, residents mourn the loss of Claude, a beloved albino alligator who had become a city icon. In tribute, a street in California has been named after Claude, reflecting the creature’s unique place in the hearts of many locals.</p>
