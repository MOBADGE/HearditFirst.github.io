    <h2>US-EU Tensions Over Greenland Tariffs</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his intention to fully impose tariffs on Greenland, escalating a dispute with the European Union. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, responded by stating that while the bloc does not want to provoke conflict, it will firmly defend its interests. The situation reflects increased friction in transatlantic relations under the Trump administration, with European leaders now adopting a more united and assertive stance in dealing with the US. Meanwhile, a former Trump economic adviser described the president’s moves on Greenland as primarily a negotiation strategy.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Uganda</h2>
<p>Ugandan opposition figure Bobi Wine, who recently lost the presidential election, has announced from hiding that he will not challenge the election results in court. He cited concerns about the lack of independence in Uganda’s judiciary and instead called for peaceful change. His decision signals ongoing political tension and uncertainty about the country’s electoral and judicial processes.</p>
<h2>Investigation Continues After Spain Train Crash</h2>
<p>Emergency teams in Spain are continuing recovery operations following a severe train crash. The twisted wreckage has complicated efforts to rescue people trapped inside the train. Authorities are investigating why the crash occurred, focusing on a possible ‘gap’ in the rail infrastructure, although further details have yet to be released.</p>
<h2>Violence and Security Threats in Kabul</h2>
<p>In Kabul, a deadly blast has prompted China to demand security assurances from the Taliban for its citizens living in Afghanistan. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the explosion, but local police are still investigating the exact cause. This attack highlights the fragile security situation in the city and ongoing risks to foreign nationals.</p>
<h2>Shark Attacks Prompt Warnings in Australia</h2>
<p>Australian authorities are warning people to avoid waterways in one state following the fourth shark attack in just 48 hours. The incidents have increased concerns about public safety, especially after recent rainfall, which can affect shark behavior and water conditions.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings Following Crash Involving Anthony Joshua’s Team</h2>
<p>The driver involved in a fatal crash that killed two members of heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua’s team has appeared in court. Joshua himself was a passenger in the incident. This case is ongoing, and the court appearance marks an early stage in the investigation of the circumstances that led to the crash.</p>
