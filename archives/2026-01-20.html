    <h2>International Tensions Over Greenland Tariffs</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed that he will "100%" carry out his threat to impose tariffs on imports from Greenland. This comes amid growing tensions between the US and the European Union. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, responded by emphasizing that while the bloc desires no conflict, it will firmly defend its interests. The dispute reflects ongoing trade and diplomatic frictions that could affect transatlantic relations if tariffs are implemented.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Increasing Attacks in Harsh Winter</h2>
<p>Russian forces have launched further strikes on Kyiv, leaving half the city without heating during a severe cold snap. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that Russia has escalated its use of ballistic missiles in the conflict, intensifying the hardship for civilians. The loss of heating amid winter conditions raises humanitarian concerns and adds pressure on Ukraine's government and international aid efforts.</p>
<h2>Spain Continues Train Crash Recovery and Probe</h2>
<p>In Spain, recovery operations continue following a devastating train crash. Authorities report that the wreckage is severely twisted, complicating rescue efforts for people who may still be trapped inside. Investigators are examining a possible "gap" in the rail infrastructure that might have contributed to the accident. The inquiry aims to determine the causes and prevent future incidents.</p>
<h2>Syria Clashes Affect Kurdish-Led Forces and IS Families</h2>
<p>Kurdish-led forces in Syria have withdrawn from a camp housing families linked to the Islamic State amid ongoing clashes with Syrian government troops. This move follows a ceasefire agreement that has not fully halted hostilities in the area. The situation reflects the fragile security environment and the challenges in managing displaced populations connected to extremist groups.</p>
<h2>Australia Enacts Gun Reform and Anti-Hate Legislation</h2>
<p>Australia’s parliament has passed new gun control and anti-hate crime laws in response to a mass shooting at a Jewish festival in December, the country’s worst in decades. The legislation aims to reduce gun violence and address hate-based offenses, signaling the government’s commitment to improving public safety after the tragedy.</p>
<h2>France Steps Up Efforts to Intercept Small Boats Crossing to UK</h2>
<p>France has carried out its first interception targeting small boats attempting to cross the Channel to the UK. This operation comes after France and the UK agreed on a change in tactics amid pressure from the UK government to increase interventions. The move aims to curb irregular migration and improve control over cross-border crossings.</p>
