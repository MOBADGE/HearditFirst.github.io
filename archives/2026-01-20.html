    <h2>Tensions Rise Over Greenland Tariffs</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his intention to impose tariffs on Greenland, stating he will "100%" carry out the threat. This move has heightened tensions with the European Union, which has vowed to protect its interests. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, emphasized that while the bloc does not want conflict, it will firmly defend its position. Publicly shared text messages between Trump and European leaders reveal ongoing exchanges on the issue. A former Trump economic adviser described the president's actions as a negotiation tactic, suggesting Greenland will remain under its current governance despite the tariff threats.</p>
<h2>European Response to US Policy</h2>
<p>The dispute over Greenland signals a shift in Europe’s approach to President Trump. Europe's soft diplomacy appears to be giving way to more assertive measures in response to US policies seen as challenging longstanding transatlantic relations. Europe Editor Katya Adler noted that while relations between the US and Europe are damaged, they are not broken. Europeans will need unity to effectively engage with Trump’s administration and navigate the complexities of this new diplomatic landscape.</p>
<h2>Spain Mourns Victims of Deadly Train Crash</h2>
<p>Spain is holding three days of mourning following a high-speed train collision in the country’s south that occurred over the weekend. The crash resulted in at least 40 deaths, marking it as Spain's deadliest rail accident in more than a decade. The tragedy has prompted national grieving and raised questions about rail safety and emergency responses. The government’s official mourning period reflects the scale of the disaster and its impact on communities.</p>
<h2>Palestinian Children’s Football Pitch Threatened</h2>
<p>A football pitch used by Palestinian children faces demolition after Israeli authorities asserted it was constructed illegally. The local football club has been ordered to remove the pitch voluntarily or risk having it torn down by Israeli forces. This development highlights ongoing tensions in the region and how infrastructure used by communities can become entangled in wider political disputes.</p>
<h2>Surge in Shark Attacks in Australia</h2>
<p>Authorities in an Australian state have issued warnings for people to avoid waterways following four shark attacks within 48 hours, the latest involving a surfer who was injured. The recent rainfall is believed to have influenced shark movements, increasing the risk in local waters. Officials are closely monitoring the situation and advising the public on safety precautions to prevent further incidents.</p>
<h2>Uganda Election Aftermath</h2>
<p>Bobi Wine, a presidential candidate who lost Uganda’s recent election, has stated he will not challenge the results in court, citing a lack of judicial independence in the country. Speaking from hiding, he appealed for peaceful change, underscoring concerns about the electoral process and post-election stability in Uganda. This announcement may shape the political climate and efforts toward dialogue or reform moving forward.</p>
