    <h2>Transatlantic Tensions Over Greenland</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to impose tariffs related to Greenland, saying he will "100%" carry out the plan. The European Union has responded firmly, with the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, stating that while the EU does not want to provoke a conflict, it will strongly defend its interests. This disagreement reflects ongoing strains in transatlantic relations, which, although damaged, are not entirely broken. European leaders appear to be adopting a more united and assertive stance in negotiations with the US under Trump’s administration.</p>
<h2>Insights into Trump's First Year Back in Office</h2>
<p>A detailed analysis of Donald Trump’s initial year after returning to office highlights his activity through various metrics, including executive orders, pardons, international trips, and social media posts on Truth Social. This numerical overview offers insight into the administration’s priorities and communication style, helping to contextualize current US policies and diplomatic approaches.</p>
<h2>Mourning and Recovery After Spain Train Collision</h2>
<p>Spain is observing three days of national mourning following a tragic high-speed train collision in the southern part of the country. The accident, which occurred on Sunday, resulted in at least 40 deaths, making it the most severe train disaster in Spain in over a decade. Officials and communities are focused on supporting victims’ families and investigating the causes to prevent future incidents.</p>
<h2>Israeli Demolition Order Targets Palestinian Children's Football Pitch</h2>
<p>A football pitch used by Palestinian children has been ordered by Israeli authorities to be removed. Israel claims the pitch was built illegally and threatens its demolition if it is not taken down voluntarily. This ultimatum has drawn attention to the ongoing tensions and disputes over land and infrastructure in the region, impacting local communities.</p>
<h2>Shark Attacks Prompt Warnings in Australian State</h2>
<p>In Australia, authorities have issued warnings to the public to avoid entering the waterways after a series of shark attacks over 48 hours. A surfer was recently injured, marking the fourth attack within this timeframe.

<h2>Nigeria Police Deny Reports of Mass Church Abductions</h2>
