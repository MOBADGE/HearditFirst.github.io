    <h2>US-EU Tensions Over Greenland Tariffs</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has affirmed he will "100%" implement tariffs on goods from Greenland, escalating trade tensions with Europe. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, responded by saying the bloc does not want to provoke a conflict but will defend its interests firmly. This stance marks a shift in Europe’s approach toward the Trump administration, highlighting the need for a united European front to engage Washington. Trump’s former chief economic adviser suggested the tariffs may be part of a broader negotiating strategy rather than a final measure. The dispute over Greenland underlines ongoing strains in transatlantic relations that, while damaged, are not broken.</p>
<h2>Spanish Train Crash Recovery and Investigation</h2>
<p>Recovery efforts continue at the scene of a devastating train crash in Spain. Authorities report that the twisted wreckage has made it challenging to recover all people trapped inside the train. Investigators are focusing on understanding a potential "gap" in the rail infrastructure that may have contributed to the accident. The probe aims to clarify the cause and prevent future tragedies, though details remain limited at this stage.</p>
<h2>Palestinian Children’s Football Pitch Faces Demolition</h2>
<p>A football pitch used by Palestinian children has been ordered to be removed by Israeli authorities, who claim it was built without proper permits. The club faces the choice of dismantling the pitch voluntarily or having it demolished by officials. This decision impacts the community’s recreational space and adds to the ongoing tensions around construction and land use in the region.</p>
<h2>Series of Shark Attacks in Australian State</h2>
<p>Authorities in an Australian state are warning the public to avoid waterways after a surge in shark attacks following recent rainfall. One surfer has been injured, marking the fourth attack in 48 hours. The incidents have raised safety concerns and prompted calls for heightened vigilance among residents and visitors near coastal areas.</p>
<h2>Court Appearance in Boxing Team Car Crash Case</h2>
<p>The driver involved in a fatal car crash that killed two team members of former heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua has made a court appearance. Joshua was a passenger in the vehicle when the accident occurred. The case is ongoing, with further legal developments expected as investigations proceed.</p>
<h2>Uganda Election Aftermath and Peace Call</h2>
<p>Ugandan opposition figure Bobi Wine, speaking from hiding, has announced he will not challenge the recent presidential election results in court, citing a lack of judiciary independence. Instead, he urged for peaceful change through other means. The statement reflects persistent political tensions in Uganda following contested election outcomes.</p>
<h2>Kabul Blast Prompts Chinese Demand for Protection</h2>
<p>Following a deadly blast in Kabul that killed several people, China has called on the Taliban to ensure the safety of its citizens in Afghanistan. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but local police are continuing their investigation into the cause. The incident underscores ongoing security challenges in the region.</p>
