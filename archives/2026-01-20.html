    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 20, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The United States and United Kingdom remain at odds over recent territorial and trade issues. US President Donald Trump criticized a UK agreement related to the Chagos Islands, calling it an "act of great stupidity," and reiterated his interest in acquiring Greenland for national security reasons. In response to tensions surrounding this and other matters, the European Union announced it will suspend approval of a US tariffs deal, signaling growing friction between the US and Europe.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>The situation in Ukraine deteriorated after renewed Russian missile strikes left half of Kyiv without heating and damaged the Ukrainian parliament building. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted Russia’s increased use of ballistic missiles in the attacks. Meanwhile, in Syria, Kurdish-led forces withdrew from the al-Hol camp, which houses families of Islamic State members, as Syrian government forces advanced into the northeast region. This movement followed a ceasefire agreement reached just two days prior.</p>
<h2>Justice and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Colombia’s judiciary sentenced former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso to 40 years in prison. The tribunal found that Mancuso’s group was responsible for over 100 crimes, many targeting an indigenous community. In another significant legal development, Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, an ex-president, was extradited to Burkina Faso in connection with accusations of involvement in a murder plot. Damiba has not publicly commented on these allegations.</p>
<h2>Domestic Policy and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Australia’s parliament passed new gun reform and anti-hate legislation following a deadly mass shooting at a Jewish festival in Bondi in December. The reforms aim to strengthen public safety and address the causes of hate-related violence in the country. In Europe, France initiated its first interception operation to prevent small boat crossings to the UK. This move comes after an agreement on new tactics as the UK government increased pressure for stronger measures to manage migrant crossings.</p>
<h2>Science and Environment</h2>
<p>A surprising discovery from animal behavior research revealed that cows are capable of using tools, a trait previously not associated with them. This finding suggests cows possess far greater cognitive abilities than scientific consensus had assumed, opening new avenues for studying animal intelligence and welfare.</p>
<h2>Transportation Safety</h2>
<p>Spain is grappling with uncertainty following a deadly train crash in the south of the country on Sunday. Investigators have yet to determine the cause of the accident, leaving officials and the public searching for answers as the investigation continues.</p>
