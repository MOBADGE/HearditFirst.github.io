    <h2>International Tensions Over Greenland and Trade</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump criticized a recent UK agreement concerning the Chagos Islands, calling it "an act of great stupidity." He also reiterated his intention to impose tariffs on Greenland, stating he will carry out this threat "100%." The European Union responded firmly to the tariff threat, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasizing the bloc's commitment to protecting its interests while avoiding unnecessary conflict. These developments highlight ongoing tensions between the US, UK, and EU over territorial and trade issues that could affect diplomatic relations and economic policies moving forward.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Increased Missile Attacks</h2>
<p>Ukraine is experiencing significant challenges as Russian forces ramp up attacks using "far more" ballistic missiles, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. This escalation has caused widespread infrastructure damage, leaving Ukraine's parliament and half of the capital city Kyiv without heating. The increased missile strikes are likely to impact civilian life and government operations, contributing to ongoing instability in the region.</p>
<h2>Security and Violence in Syria and Colombia</h2>
<p>Kurdish-led forces have withdrawn from the al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria during ongoing clashes, coinciding with an advance by Syrian government troops. This withdrawal comes just two days after a ceasefire agreement, raising concerns about the future security of families associated with the Islamic State group housed at the camp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Colombia has sentenced former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso to 40 years in prison. Mancuso's group was found responsible for more than 100 crimes, including attacks against an indigenous community. This ruling marks a continuing effort by Colombian authorities to address past violence perpetrated by paramilitary organizations.</p>
<h2>Australia Implements Gun Reform</h2>
<p>In response to a deadly mass shooting at a Jewish festival in Bondi last December, the Australian parliament has passed new gun reform and anti-hate legislation. These measures aim to prevent similar tragedies in the future by tightening regulations and addressing issues related to hate crimes. The reforms reflect a broader push within Australia to enhance public safety and counteract extremist violence.</p>
<h2>France Targets Small Boat Crossings to UK</h2>
<p>French authorities carried out their first interception aimed at preventing small boat crossings to the UK. This operation follows a recent shift in tactics agreed upon amid mounting pressure from the UK government for increased intervention. The new approach seeks to curb dangerous migration attempts across the English Channel and improve cooperation between the two countries on border security.</p>
<h2>Unusual Animal Behavior Discovered</h2>
<p>Scientists have observed a cow using tools, a rare behavior not previously associated with this species. This finding suggests that cows may possess much higher cognitive abilities than once thought, offering new insights into animal intelligence and behavior. Further research may deepen understanding of how animals interact with their environments and adapt to challenges.</p>
