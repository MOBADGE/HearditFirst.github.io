    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions are rising between the United States and Europe as the US president has highlighted national security concerns related to Greenland. He described the UK’s recent deal over the Chagos Islands as an "act of great stupidity" and emphasized the strategic importance of Greenland, renewing calls for its acquisition. This standoff has contributed to Europe’s decision to suspend approval of a US tariffs agreement, reflecting increased strain in transatlantic relations.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Ceasefire in Syria</h2>
<p>A new four-day ceasefire has been agreed upon in Syria between the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF, a Kurdish-led group, withdrew its fighters from the al-Hol camp, which houses families of Islamic State members, citing compulsion to do so. The ceasefire aims to reduce hostilities in the area and could provide a temporary pause in the ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Under Attack</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing intensified attacks as Russian forces have increased the use of ballistic missiles. The strikes have caused significant disruption, leaving Ukraine’s parliament and half of Kyiv without heating amid ongoing military conflict. Ukrainian President Zelensky has highlighted the escalation in missile attacks, signaling a more aggressive phase in the conflict.</p>
<h2>Tragedy and Uncertainty in Spain</h2>
<p>Spain is grappling with shock and confusion following a deadly train crash in the south of the country on Sunday. Investigators continue to search for answers as the cause of the accident remains unclear. The incident has raised concerns about rail safety and emergency response measures.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in Colombia and Burkina Faso</h2>
<p>In Colombia, Salvatore Mancuso, a former paramilitary leader, has been sentenced to 40 years in prison. His group was responsible for over 100 crimes, including violence against indigenous communities. Meanwhile, in Burkina Faso, Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, an ex-president, has been extradited amid accusations of plotting murder. He has not responded publicly to the charges.</p>
<h2>Domestic Policy Responses in Australia</h2>
<p>Following a deadly mass shooting at a Jewish festival in Bondi in December, the Australian parliament has passed new gun reform and anti-hate legislation. These measures aim to address public safety concerns and prevent similar attacks in the future.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery</h2>
<p>In a surprising development, scientists have observed a cow using tools, an ability that was previously thought to be rare in such animals. This finding suggests that cows may possess higher cognitive functions than previously assumed, opening new avenues for research into animal intelligence.</p>
