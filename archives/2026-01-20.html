    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Tensions are rising internationally due to actions by Donald Trump, who has stated strong demands to acquire Greenland. This has been described as shaking the world order more than any president since World War II. Trump has also criticized the UK's Chagos deal, calling it an "act of great stupidity," tying it into his broader national security arguments for acquiring Greenland. The situation has strained relations between the US and Europe, leading the EU to suspend the approval of a US trade deal amid falling global markets and renewed tensions.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing intensified attacks by Russia, with President Zelensky reporting that Russia has started using significantly more ballistic missiles. These strikes have caused heating outages in Kyiv, including affecting the parliament building. The escalation points to worsening conditions in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Middle East Ceasefire</h2>
<p>In Syria, a new four-day ceasefire has been declared between the government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF has withdrawn its fighters from the al-Hol camp, which houses families of Islamic State members. The ceasefire may create a temporary halt in fighting after the recent withdrawal, although the situation remains complex.</p>
<h2>Spain Train Crash</h2>
<p>Spain is dealing with the aftermath of a deadly commuter train crash near Barcelona that killed the driver and injured at least 14 people. The crash occurred between Gelida and Sant Sadurní. Investigators have so far been unable to determine the cause of the accident, leaving officials and the public searching for answers amid shock and confusion.</p>
<h2>Colombia Judicial Action</h2>
<p>In Colombia, a former paramilitary leader, Salvatore Mancuso, has been sentenced to 40 years in jail. His group was responsible for over 100 crimes, many targeting indigenous communities, according to the tribunal’s ruling. This verdict represents a significant moment in Colombia's efforts to address violence and human rights abuses committed during past conflicts.</p>
<h2>West Africa Political Developments</h2>
<p>Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, an ex-president, has been extradited to Burkina Faso on accusations related to a murder plot. He has not publicly commented on the allegations. This development adds to ongoing political challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Personal News</h2>
<p>Usha Vance, the second lady, has announced she is pregnant with her fourth child. She shared on social media that she is expecting a boy, due in late July. This personal update adds a lighter note amidst the many global and regional issues currently unfolding.</p>
