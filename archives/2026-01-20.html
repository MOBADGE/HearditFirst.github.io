    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 20, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US, UK, and Europe have risen following US president Donald Trump's remark calling a UK deal over the Chagos Islands an "act of great stupidity." Trump also reiterated his interest in acquiring Greenland, citing national security concerns. In response to these developments, Europe has announced it will suspend approval of a US tariffs deal. The suspension signals growing friction between the US and the European Union linked to Trump’s pursuit of Greenland and broader disagreements.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Violence</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, Russian missile strikes have left the parliament and half of Kyiv without heating. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that Russia has begun using far more ballistic missiles in its attacks, escalating the conflict's impact on civilians and infrastructure. Meanwhile, in Syria, a new four-day ceasefire has been declared between the government and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after the SDF withdrew fighters from the al-Hol camp for families associated with the Islamic State. The SDF said they were compelled to pull back from the camp, but the ceasefire aims to reduce violence temporarily.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>Spain is still searching for answers after a deadly train crash in the south of the country on Sunday. Investigators are shocked and confused, as the cause of the accident remains unclear. In Colombia, Salvatore Mancuso, a former paramilitary leader, has been sentenced to 40 years in prison. The tribunal found that Mancuso’s group committed over 100 crimes, many targeting indigenous communities.</p>
<h2>Domestic Policy Changes and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Australia has passed important gun reform and anti-hate legislation following a mass shooting at a Jewish festival in Bondi last December, which was the country’s worst in decades. The new laws aim to improve public safety and combat hate crimes. In France, authorities carried out their first interception operation to stop small boat crossings to the UK after agreeing on a change of tactics. This move comes amid increasing pressure from the UK government to intensify efforts to reduce illegal migration via the Channel.</p>
<h2>Science and Unusual Discoveries</h2>
<p>Scientists have observed a cow using tools, a rare behavior that challenges previous assumptions about the cognitive abilities of cows. This discovery suggests that cows may possess far greater intelligence and problem-solving skills than previously understood.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Africa</h2>
<p>Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, an ex-president, has been extradited to Burkina Faso where he faces accusations related to a murder plot. Damiba has not publicly responded to the allegations. The extradition marks a significant step in legal proceedings concerning political violence in the region.</p>
