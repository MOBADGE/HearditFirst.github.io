The warnings aim to prevent further incidents while monitoring of coastal and freshwater areas continues.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the community paid tribute to Claude, a beloved albino alligator who had become a local icon. The city commemorated Claude’s impact and popularity by naming a street after the reptile, celebrating the unique connection between the animal and residents who cherished his albinism.</p>
