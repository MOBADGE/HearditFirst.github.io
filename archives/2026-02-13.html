    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Rubio is set to give a major speech in Munich addressing a "new era" in geopolitics, marking the first significant transatlantic meeting since heightened tensions arose when former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to annex Greenland. This event signals ongoing shifts and discussions in the global political landscape, particularly between the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan has seized a Chinese fishing vessel that attempted to flee an inspection inside Japan's territorial waters, reflecting rising tensions between Tokyo and Beijing. This incident underscores ongoing disputes related to maritime boundaries and resource rights in the region.</p>
<p>In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the military will be deployed alongside the police to combat organized crime and illegal mining. This move aims to strengthen law enforcement efforts against criminal gangs that threaten public safety and economic stability.</p>
<h2>Environment and Energy</h2>
<p>The U.S. administration has revoked a landmark ruling that classified greenhouse gases as endangering public health. The White House described this move as the largest deregulation in U.S. history, but environmentalists warn it could have costly consequences for the American public by weakening environmental protections designed to combat climate change.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>The FBI has released a description of a suspect in the kidnapping case of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie, who disappeared from her Arizona home two weeks ago. The investigation continues as authorities seek to locate her and bring the responsible party to justice.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Liberal Party has ousted Sussan Ley as leader after just nine months, replacing her with Angus Taylor. Ley's removal came amid poor polling results, indicating political instability within the party as it seeks to regain public support.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Public Response</h2>
<p>In Sydney, police conduct at a protest against the Israeli president is under investigation after videos emerged appearing to show officers punching demonstrators. The incident has raised concerns about the handling of public protests and police accountability.</p>
<p>In a human interest story from India, Deepak Kumar has been hailed as a hero for standing up to Hindu vigilantes in defense of a Muslim individual, an act that has also led to death threats against him. His actions highlight ongoing social tensions and the risks faced by those who challenge sectarian violence.</p>
<h2>Health and Family</h2>
<p>A BBC report has revealed the devastating effects of side effects from a common Parkinson’s medication on families. One case detailed involves a husband whose behavior, influenced by the drug, led to theft and marital breakdown. This story sheds light on the complex challenges faced by patients and families dealing with chronic illnesses and their treatments.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Charity</h2>
<p>The family of the late actor James Van Der Beek, known for his role in Dawson’s Creek, has expressed gratitude for donations to a $2 million GoFundMe campaign supporting them. Steven Spielberg personally contributed $25,000 to the fund, drawing attention to the ongoing support within the entertainment community for those facing personal tragedy.</p>
