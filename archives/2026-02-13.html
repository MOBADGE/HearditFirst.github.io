    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Security Concerns</h2>
<p>At the Munich Security Summit, the German chancellor warned that the world’s rules-based order no longer exists. He highlighted that freedom is not guaranteed in today’s era of competing big powers, signaling increasing global uncertainty and challenges to established international norms. This reflection comes amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and may influence future diplomatic and security efforts worldwide.</p>
<h2>Political Changes in Bangladesh and Hungary</h2>
<p>Bangladesh held its first election since a Gen Z uprising resulted in a shift of power. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party won decisively, raising hopes among voters for a return to democratic governance after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Sheikh Hasina. Meanwhile in Hungary, Peter Magyar, a political figure challenging Viktor Orban, accused his opponents of plotting to blackmail him by threatening to release a private sex tape. These developments illustrate ongoing political volatility and contestations in both countries.</p>
<h2>Environmental Policy Shift in the US</h2>
<p>The US government announced a major change in climate policy by removing the legal foundation for much of the country’s environmental legislation. This move, revealed on Thursday, could have significant effects on climate action and regulation. Experts have outlined six possible impacts, suggesting broad implications for environmental protection efforts in the US and potential global repercussions.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Sports News</h2>
<p>The Louvre museum faced setbacks after a leak damaged a 19th-century painting. This incident adds to a growing list of problems at the world’s most visited museum, prompting increased scrutiny of its management and preservation practices.</p>
<p>In sports, Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from competing at the Winter Olympics. The Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed his appeal to wear a helmet featuring images of athletes killed during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ending his participation in the games.</p>
<h2>Leadership Changes and Security Measures</h2>
<p>The head of the Dubai-based ports company stepped down following revelations about extensive email exchanges with Jeffrey Epstein. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem’s resignation follows scrutiny due to these disclosed connections.</p>
<p>In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a new deployment of troops to support police in combating organized crime and illegal mining. This move aims to strengthen national security and tackle rising criminal activities.</p>
<p>Lastly, Japanese authorities seized a Chinese fishing vessel after it attempted to flee an inspection within Japan’s territorial waters. The incident occurred amid ongoing tensions between Japan and Beijing, highlighting continued disputes over maritime activities.</p>
