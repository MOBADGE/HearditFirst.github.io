    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to speak at a major transatlantic meeting in Munich, marking the first such gathering since President Donald Trump’s controversial proposal to annex Greenland. Rubio’s remarks are expected to address what he calls a “new era in geopolitics” and highlight shifts in international relations between the US and Europe. This event signals ongoing efforts to redefine alliances and strategic priorities amid evolving global challenges.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a decisive victory in the country’s first election since a youth-led uprising known as the Gen Z movement began. The election outcome has raised hopes among citizens for a return to democratic governance after 15 years of rule under Sheikh Hasina’s authoritarian government. This political shift could have significant implications for Bangladesh’s domestic policies and international relations.</p>
<h2>Environment and Regulation</h2>
<p>In the United States, the White House has revoked a landmark environmental ruling that classified greenhouse gases as a threat to public health. This move, described by the administration as the largest deregulation effort in US history, rolls back key climate protections. Environmental groups warn this decision will have costly consequences, potentially accelerating climate change impacts. The change reflects ongoing debates over balancing economic interests with environmental stewardship.</p>
<h2>Security and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Japan announced the seizure of a Chinese fishing vessel after it attempted to evade inspection within Japanese territorial waters. The incident highlights simmering tensions between Tokyo and Beijing over maritime boundaries and fishing rights. Authorities’ swift action underscores efforts to assert control in contested areas and maintain security.</p>
<p>In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced plans to deploy the military alongside police forces to combat organized crime and illegal mining operations. This coordinated approach aims to curb rising criminal activity and reinforce law enforcement capabilities amid concerns over security and economic stability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FBI issued a description of a suspect connected to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of television journalist Savannah Guthrie. Nancy went missing from her Arizona home two weeks ago, and authorities continue to investigate the case.</p>
<h2>Domestic Politics in Australia</h2>
<p>Australia’s Liberal Party has removed Sussan Ley from her leadership role after just nine months in office, replacing her with Angus Taylor. Ley’s tenure was marked by poor polling results, prompting party members to seek new leadership ahead of upcoming political challenges. The change reflects ongoing volatility within Australian party politics.</p>
<h2>Space and Technology</h2>
<p>SpaceX successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket to the International Space Station. The mission was broadcast live, drawing attention to ongoing commercial and governmental collaboration in space exploration. Continued launches like this demonstrate the expanding role of private companies in advancing scientific research and technology development in orbit.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Human Interest</h2>
<p>Actor and filmmaker Steven Spielberg donated $25,000 to a $2 million GoFundMe campaign for the family of James Van Der Beek, known for his role in Dawson’s Creek. The campaign supports Van Der Beek’s family during a difficult time, with public gratitude expressed for contributors’ generosity. This act highlights the supportive role of the entertainment community in personal crises.</p>
