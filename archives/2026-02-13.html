    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Environment and Climate Policy</h2>
<p>The White House announced the revocation of a landmark ruling that classified greenhouse gases as a danger to public health. This decision is being described by officials as the largest deregulation in US history. However, environmental groups caution that this move could have costly consequences for Americans, likely affecting efforts to address climate change and reduce pollution.</p>
<h2>International Maritime Incident</h2>
<p>Japanese authorities reported seizing a Chinese fishing vessel after it attempted to flee during an inspection inside Japan’s territorial waters. The situation has heightened tensions between Japan and China, underscoring ongoing disputes over maritime boundaries and fishing rights in the region.</p>
<h2>Australian Political Leadership Change</h2>
<p>Australia’s Liberal Party has removed Sussan Ley as its leader after only nine months in the role. Ley, who was the party’s first woman leader, faced poor polling results that contributed to her ousting. She was replaced by Angus Taylor. The brief leadership tenure has sparked discussions about the challenges women continue to face in Australian politics, especially when taking leadership roles during times of crisis.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Legal Dispute in the US</h2>
<p>In the United States, singer Taylor Swift’s team has requested that the government block a trademark application by a bedding firm named “Swift Home.” The objection is based on claims that the firm’s design closely resembles Swift’s trademarked signature. This legal action highlights ongoing issues related to brand identity and intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry.</p>
<h2>Community Impact of Canadian Tragedy</h2>
<p>A small town in British Columbia, Canada, is grappling with grief following a recent mass shooting. Residents have expressed widespread shock and sadness, noting that almost everyone in the community has been affected in some way. The event has united the town in mourning and highlighted the broader issue of gun violence impacting communities nationwide.</p>
<h2>Social Heroism Amid Religious Tensions</h2>
<p>Deepak Kumar, a Hindu man, has been recognized for standing up against vigilantes targeting Muslims. His actions have been described as a rare act of heroism in a tense social climate. However, his courage has also led to him receiving death threats, reflecting the dangers individuals face when confronting religious extremism and communal violence.</p>
