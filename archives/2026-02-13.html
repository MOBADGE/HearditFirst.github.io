    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The US Secretary of State is set to address a key transatlantic meeting in Munich amid changing geopolitical dynamics. This comes after tensions sparked by former US President Donald Trump's suggestion about annexing Greenland. The upcoming speech aims to signal a new era in geopolitics for Europe and the United States, highlighting evolving challenges and partnerships across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, the Nationalist Party won a decisive victory in the country’s first election since a Gen Z-led uprising. This marks a significant shift after 15 years under the authoritarian leadership of Sheikh Hasina, with voters expressing hope for a return to democratic governance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan reported the seizure of a Chinese fishing vessel that attempted to evade inspection in its territorial waters. This incident adds to rising tensions between Japan and China, reflecting ongoing disputes in the region.</p>
<h2>Environment and Energy Policy</h2>
<p>The US government has revoked a landmark ruling that once classified greenhouse gases as a threat to public health. The White House described this move as the largest deregulation effort in US history. Environmental groups, however, warn that this rollback could have serious long-term health and environmental consequences for Americans, raising concerns over regulatory priorities in tackling climate change.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced deployment of the military to support police forces in combating organised crime and illegal mining activities. This step aims to address growing concerns about crime gangs operating within the country and strengthen internal security measures.</p>
<p>In the US, the FBI released a description of a suspect connected to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie. Nancy went missing from her home in Arizona two weeks ago, and authorities continue to investigate the case.</p>
<h2>Leadership Changes</h2>
<p>Australia’s Liberal Party replaced its first woman leader, Sussan Ley, who was removed after nine months due to poor polling results. Angus Taylor was confirmed as her successor, signaling potential shifts in the party's strategy ahead of upcoming political challenges.</p>
<h2>Culture and Space</h2>
<p>In entertainment news, filmmaker Steven Spielberg donated $25,000 to a $2 million GoFundMe campaign for the family of the late actor James Van Der Beek, known for his role in Dawson’s Creek. The family expressed gratitude to all contributors supporting the collection.</p>
<p>In space exploration, SpaceX successfully launched its Falcon 9 rocket to the International Space Station. The event was widely followed, showcasing ongoing advances in commercial space travel and international cooperation in orbit.</p>
