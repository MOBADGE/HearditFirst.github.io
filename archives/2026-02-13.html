    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Security and Geopolitics</h2>
<p>At the Munich Security Summit, Germany's chancellor raised serious concerns about the stability of the international order, warning that a rules-based global system "no longer exists." He emphasized that freedom is not guaranteed in an era dominated by powerful nations asserting their own interests. This underscores growing tensions and uncertainties in global security, which could affect international cooperation and conflict resolution going forward.</p>
<h2>Environmental Policy in the United States</h2>
<p>The U.S. government announced a major policy change that removes the legal foundation for much of the country's environmental legislation. This shift could significantly affect climate policy, as the legal bedrock supporting environmental protection measures is dismantled. The impacts of this change are still unfolding but may influence greenhouse gas emissions, regulatory approaches, and the country’s role in addressing climate change.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Hungary</h2>
<p>In Hungary, political tensions are rising ahead of elections. Peter Magyar, a rival to the current leadership, has accused opposition figures of planning to release a sex tape involving him from August 2024 as a form of blackmail. This accusation highlights increasing political strife and personal attacks in the lead-up to national elections.</p>
<h2>Human Impact of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukrainian athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych has drawn attention for displaying the faces of fellow athletes killed since Russia's full-scale invasion on his helmet. His choice highlights the personal and human costs of the ongoing conflict, reminding the world of the sacrifices and losses endured beyond the battlefield.</p>
<h2>Corporate Resignations Linked to Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
<p>Two senior figures connected to major corporations have resigned following revelations about their communications with Jeffrey Epstein. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, head of a Dubai-based ports company, stepped down after emails showed extensive exchanges with Epstein. Similarly, a top Goldman Sachs lawyer resigned after emails surfaced in which he referred to Epstein affectionately, likening him to "an older brother" and accepting luxury gifts. These resignations come amid broader scrutiny of Epstein's network and its connections to influential people.</p>
<h2>Regional Tensions in the West Bank</h2>
<p>In the West Bank, the mayor of Hebron expressed concern over expanding Israeli control, stating, "We are not protected." Palestinians report that Israeli authorities are increasingly shutting them out of decision-making related to planning and development. This expansion of control has heightened fears of reduced autonomy and could exacerbate tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Developments</h2>
<p>- French prosecutors have launched an investigation into five baby formula producers amid contamination recalls due to possible toxic substances. The probe aims to determine whether the companies bear responsibility for distributing unsafe products.</p>
<p>- Former CNN host Don Lemon has pleaded not guilty in a case involving charges for protesting immigration raids during a church service in Minnesota. He and eight others are accused of interrupting the religious event to voice their opposition.</p>
<p>- In Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party has won a decisive electoral victory in the country's first vote since a recent uprising led by Generation Z. After 15 years of authoritarian rule, many voters hope this marks a return to democratic governance.</p>
