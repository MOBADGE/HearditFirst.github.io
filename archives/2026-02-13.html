    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, is preparing to speak at a major transatlantic meeting in Munich, the first such event since President Donald Trump threatened to annex Greenland. Rubio’s speech is expected to address a new era in geopolitics, highlighting shifting alliances and potential challenges facing Europe and the United States. This meeting reflects ongoing efforts to strengthen transatlantic ties amid emerging global tensions.</p>
<p>In Japan, authorities seized a Chinese fishing vessel after it attempted to escape inspection within Japan’s territorial waters. This incident adds to existing strains between Japan and China, underscoring ongoing disputes over maritime boundaries and sovereignty in the region.</p>
<h2>United States Policy and Politics</h2>
<p>The Biden administration has revoked a landmark Environmental Protection Agency ruling that classified greenhouse gases as a danger to public health. The White House describes this move as the largest deregulation in US history, aiming to ease regulatory burdens on industries. However, environmental groups warn that this rollback could have harmful consequences for public health and climate change efforts in the long term.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FBI has released a description of a suspect in the kidnapping case of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie, who disappeared from her home in Arizona two weeks ago. The investigation remains active as authorities seek public assistance.</p>
<h2>Elections and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Bangladesh has held its first election since a significant uprising involving Gen Z citizens. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party won by a large margin, signaling hopes among voters for a return to democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Sheikh Hasina. This political shift could lead to changes in governance and policy direction in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>In Hungary, Peter Magyar, a rival in the upcoming election against the current leadership, accused his opponents of planning to release a sex tape recorded in August 2024 as a form of blackmail. This allegation highlights heightened tensions and intense campaigning ahead of the election.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a deployment of troops to collaborate with police forces to combat organized crime and illegal mining activities. This decision comes as part of broader efforts to restore law and order in areas affected by criminal gangs, underlining the government’s commitment to addressing security challenges.</p>
<h2>Culture and Environment</h2>
<p>The Louvre museum in Paris is facing scrutiny after a leak damaged a 19th-century painting. This is the latest in a series of incidents at one of the world’s most visited museums, raising concerns about the preservation and security of valuable artworks. Museum officials are under pressure to improve safeguards and prevent future damage.</p>
<h2>Space and Technology</h2>
<p>SpaceX successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket bound for the International Space Station, marking another milestone in commercial spaceflight. The mission supports ongoing scientific research and international cooperation in space exploration. This event showcases continued progress in advancing space technology and capabilities.</p>
