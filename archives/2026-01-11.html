    <h2>International Tensions and Conflicts</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high between Iran and the United States, with Iran warning of retaliation if attacked by the US. Meanwhile, US forces recently seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, prompting former US President Donald Trump to urge Cuba to "make a deal before it is too late." In Syria, the US military conducted large-scale strikes on Islamic State targets, ordered by President Trump. Clashes in northern Syria have also led to a ceasefire deal, resulting in the last Kurdish forces leaving the city of Aleppo after a week of violence.</p>
<h2>Protests and Civil Unrest</h2>
<p>Protests persist in the United States over immigration enforcement and recent deaths linked to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Thousands marched in Minneapolis and other cities following the death of Renee Good, with dozens of protesters arrested. In Iran, widespread demonstrations continue despite a crackdown, with reports of more than 100 bodies brought into hospitals over two days, highlighting the severity of the unrest.</p>
<h2>Human Tragedies and Disasters</h2>
<p>Several tragic incidents were reported globally. In Pakistan, a gas cylinder explosion at a house killed eight people, including a bride and groom, the day after their wedding celebration. Australia is battling severe bushfires in Victoria, where a state of emergency has been declared. The fires have destroyed around 300 buildings and claimed one life as thousands of firefighters work to control the blaze.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Sudan</h2>
<p>Sudan's military-backed government has returned to the capital, Khartoum, nearly three years after it was driven out by a paramilitary rival group. The return marks a significant moment after prolonged conflict and displacement in the capital.</p>
<h2>Energy Costs and Economic Struggles in the US</h2>
<p>Rising energy prices have become a major challenge for US families, with some experiencing prolonged power outages—one family reported having no electricity for six months. The soaring costs for electricity are contributing to the wider cost-of-living crisis, pushing many households deeper into debt and financial hardship.</p>
<h2>Cultural Note</h2>
<p>Bob Weir, co-founder of the psychedelic rock group the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78. He was a key figure in the band's legacy and its various offshoots over six decades.</p>
