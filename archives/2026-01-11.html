    <h2>Middle East Tensions and Conflict</h2>
<p>Iran has warned that it will retaliate if the United States launches any attacks against it. The warning comes amid violent protests in Tehran, described by witnesses as resembling a "war zone," with hundreds reportedly killed. Meanwhile, US forces conducted large-scale strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria following an order from US President Donald Trump. In northern Syria, a ceasefire deal led to the withdrawal of the last Kurdish forces from Aleppo after a week of fierce clashes.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Sudan and Venezuela</h2>
<p>In Sudan, the military-backed government has returned to the capital, Khartoum, nearly three years after being displaced by a paramilitary rival. This marks a significant development in the country's ongoing conflict. Elsewhere in Latin America, former US President Donald Trump has turned his focus to Cuba after US forces detained Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, urging Cuba to "make a deal before it is too late."</p>
<h2>Civil Unrest and Protests in the United States</h2>
<p>Protests continue across the United States following the death of Renee Good. Thousands marched in Minneapolis and other cities, with dozens of arrests reported during demonstrations opposing the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This unrest reflects ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement policies in the country.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters: Bushfires in Australia and Extreme Cold in Finland</h2>
<p>Australia faces a severe crisis as bushfires in the state of Victoria have destroyed about 300 buildings and caused one death. Thousands of firefighters are battling the blazes amid a declared state of emergency. Simultaneously, extreme cold weather in northern Finland has led to the cancellation of all flights at Kittila airport, stranding thousands of tourists amid temperatures dropping as low as -38°C.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accident in Pakistan</h2>
<p>In Pakistan, a gas cylinder explosion at a house resulted in the deaths of eight people, including a bride and groom, on the morning following their wedding celebration. The blast caused significant casualties and is a tragic reminder of the risks associated with unsafe gas handling and infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Cultural News</h2>
<p>Bob Weir, co-founder of the legendary psychedelic rock group Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78. He was a key figure in the band and its various offshoots over a career spanning more than six decades, leaving a lasting legacy in music history.</p>
