    <h2>Middle East Tensions and Conflict</h2>
<p>Iran has warned it will retaliate if the United States attacks, as protests in the country have turned deadly with hundreds reportedly killed. Streets in Tehran are described as resembling a war zone amid ongoing unrest. Meanwhile, the US military has conducted large-scale airstrikes targeting Islamic State group sites in Syria. These strikes were ordered by US President Donald Trump as part of ongoing efforts against militant groups in the region.</p>
<p>In Syria, a ceasefire deal has been reached after a week of violent clashes, leading to the withdrawal of the last Kurdish forces from Aleppo. This development marks a significant change in control and could impact the broader conflict dynamics in northern Syria.</p>
<h2>Political Shifts and Protests</h2>
<p>Sudan’s military-backed government has returned to the capital, Khartoum, after nearly three years of conflict during which it was ousted by a rival paramilitary group. The government’s return may signal a new phase in Sudan’s political situation following prolonged instability.</p>
<p>In the United States, protests continue following the death of Renee Good. Thousands marched in Minneapolis and other cities to demonstrate against the policies of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The protests have resulted in dozens of arrests amid calls for changes to immigration enforcement.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Diplomatic Moves</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has called on Cuba to negotiate with the United States, urging the island nation to "make a deal before it is too late." This statement comes shortly after US forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, highlighting increasing US involvement and pressure in Latin America.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Emergencies</h2>
<p>Australia is grappling with severe bushfires that have destroyed around 300 buildings and resulted in one death. A state of emergency has been declared in the state of Victoria, where thousands of firefighters are engaged in efforts to control the blaze.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, a tragic gas explosion at a house the morning after a wedding killed eight people, including the bride and groom. The incident underscores ongoing safety concerns related to gas cylinders in the region.</p>
<h2>Weather Disruptions in Europe</h2>
<p>Extreme cold weather in northern Finland has led to the cancellation of all flights out of Kittila airport, stranding thousands of tourists in the Lapland region. Temperatures have plummeted to as low as -38°C, causing significant travel disruptions amid the severe cold snap.</p>
<h2>In Memoriam</h2>
<p>Bob Weir, co-founder of the iconic psychedelic rock band Grateful Dead, has died at age 78. Weir was an influential figure in the music world for over six decades, contributing to the band and various related projects.</p>
