    <h2>Legal Proceedings Around Jeffrey Epstein's Associate</h2>
<p>A video has surfaced showing Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently jailed, refusing to answer questions related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender, during a congressional hearing. This development highlights ongoing interest and investigation into Epstein’s activities and those linked to him. Maxwell’s silence could affect future legal or congressional actions concerning the Epstein case.</p>
<h2>Missing Person Case and Public Appeal</h2>
<p>Savannah Guthrie, a television host, has made a public plea for help in finding her missing mother. This appeal came just hours before a reported deadline linked to a ransom demand from the alleged kidnappers. The situation remains unresolved and is generating concern among viewers and the public. Efforts to locate Guthrie’s mother are continuing, underscoring the urgency of the case.</p>
<h2>US-Canada Bridge Opening Faces Political Threat</h2>
<p>The scheduled opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, connecting Michigan and Ontario, faces uncertainty after threats from Donald Trump. The bridge is planned to open this year, promising to improve trade and travel between the US and Canada. However, Trump’s indication that he might block its opening introduces potential delays and political contention around this important infrastructure project.</p>
<h2>US Tariff Exemptions for Bangladeshi Clothing</h2>
<p>The White House has agreed to exempt certain Bangladeshi clothing products from US tariffs, specifically allowing exemptions for those made from US-produced cotton. This decision is likely to impact the trade relationship between the United States and Bangladesh, supporting Bangladeshi garment exports while protecting aspects of the American cotton industry. It may also influence broader trade discussions and economic ties.</p>
<h2>New Video Game Explores Themes of Cultural Repatriation</h2>
<p>A newly released video game set in the year 2099 imagines a world where a historic treaty to return African artifacts is breaking down. Players can explore scenarios involving the reclamation of looted cultural treasures. This game is notable for engaging with ongoing debates about the return of cultural property to African nations and reflects creative interest in issues of historical justice and cultural identity.</p>
