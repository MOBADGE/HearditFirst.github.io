    <h2>Legal Proceedings and Epstein Connections</h2>
<p>A video released by members of the U.S. Congress shows Ghislaine Maxwell, a jailed associate of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, refusing to answer questions about Epstein during a congressional hearing. This development highlights ongoing efforts to uncover details about Epstein’s actions and possible associates. The reluctance to provide testimony may affect investigations and any future legal proceedings related to the case.</p>
<h2>Police Actions in Australia Protest</h2>
<p>Police in Australia have defended their conduct following violence at a protest against the visit of the Israeli president. Videos from the rally show officers punching protesters and dragging men who were praying away from the scene. The incident has raised questions about law enforcement tactics during protests and could prompt reviews of police procedures and responses to demonstrations.</p>
<h2>US-Canada Bridge Opening at Risk</h2>
<p>The planned opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will connect Michigan and Ontario, may face delays following threats from Donald Trump to block the project. The bridge is an important infrastructure link for trade and travel between the United States and Canada. Any obstruction could disrupt cross-border commerce and diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Industry Fallout from Epstein Files</h2>
<p>Singer Chappell Roan has left a talent agency led by Casey Wasserman after emails emerged showing Wasserman sending flirtatious messages to Ghislaine Maxwell. This revelation has sparked criticism of Wasserman and led some clients to distance themselves from the agency. It reflects the continuing impact of the Epstein case on individuals and companies tied to the scandal.</p>
<h2>Social Media Addiction Trial</h2>
<p>Owners of Instagram and YouTube are facing a landmark jury trial in Los Angeles over accusations that they created "addiction machines" by designing their platforms to foster social media dependence. This case could have broad implications for how social media companies are regulated and held accountable for their role in public mental health issues.</p>
<h2>Rights of Same-Sex Couples in the Philippines</h2>
<p>The Philippine Supreme Court has issued a landmark ruling allowing same-sex couples to co-own property. The court emphasized that "legitimate intimate relationships" should not be legally invisible. This decision marks a significant step toward greater recognition of same-sex partnerships and property rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Additional News Briefs</h2>
<p>- The White House announced exemptions for some Bangladeshi clothing exports from U.S. tariffs, specifically for products using US-produced cotton. This move aims to support trade relations and manufacturing cooperation between the two nations.
  
- Savannah Guthrie made a public plea for help locating her missing mother as a reported ransom deadline passed. The situation remains unresolved, and authorities continue to search.</p>
<p>- A new video game set in 2099 imagines an Africa reclaiming its looted treasures after a historic treaty fails, offering a creative exploration of cultural restitution and historical justice.</p>
<p>- Actress Catherine O'Hara, known for her roles in *Schitt’s Creek* and *Home Alone*, died last month at age 71. Her cause of death was confirmed as a blood clot.</p>
<p>These stories reflect a range of ongoing social, legal, and cultural developments around the world.</p>
