    <h2>US Justice Department Faces Criticism Over Epstein Files</h2>
<p>Two US lawmakers, Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, have raised concerns that the Justice Department is "inappropriately" redacting documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. They argue that the department is not following a transparency law meant to give the public more access to these files. This dispute highlights ongoing tensions over government openness in high-profile legal cases. The lawmakers’ push may lead to further scrutiny or legal action to ensure full compliance with information disclosure requirements.</p>
<h2>Macron Calls on Europe to Assert Global Influence</h2>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has issued a strong message urging Europe to act more like a world power. He warned that the continent faces increasing threats not only from China and Russia but also from the United States. Macron described the situation as a "wake-up call," emphasizing the need for Europe to strengthen its political and strategic role on the world stage. This call may prompt discussions among European leaders about closer cooperation and new policies to safeguard the continent’s interests amid shifting global dynamics.</p>
<h2>Kenya Confronts Russia Over Use of Kenyan Nationals in Combat</h2>
<p>Kenya is taking a firm stance against the use of its nationals in foreign combat operations, specifically targeting Russia. Kenyan authorities say they have shut down illegal recruitment efforts and plan to press Moscow to sign an agreement banning conscription of Kenyan citizens. This development reflects Nairobi’s efforts to protect its citizens from being drawn into international conflicts without consent, potentially straining Kenya-Russia relations unless an accord is reached.</p>
<h2>Savannah Guthrie Makes Public Plea Following Ransom Deadline</h2>
<p>Television presenter Savannah Guthrie has issued a new public appeal amid a tense situation involving her 84-year-old mother. The appeal comes after a reported ransom deadline passed, with her mother believed to be held captive. Guthrie’s message underscores the ongoing uncertainty and urgency surrounding the case. Authorities and the public remain attentive to developments, though no further details have been confirmed publicly.</p>
<h2>Social Media Companies Face Trial Over Addiction Claims</h2>
<p>Owners of Instagram and YouTube are defending themselves in a landmark jury trial in Los Angeles, where they are accused of building "addiction machines." The case scrutinizes how the social media platforms may encourage addictive behavior among users. The trial could have significant implications for the regulation of social media companies and how they design their products, with potential impacts on user protections and corporate responsibilities in the tech industry.</p>
<h2>Buddhist Monks Conclude Walk for Peace in Washington DC</h2>
<p>A group of 19 Buddhist monks ended a 108-day silent walk from Texas to Washington DC aimed at promoting peace in the United States. Walking single file, the monks sought to raise awareness of peace and non-violence at a time of social and political challenges. Their journey attracted attention as a symbol of mindfulness and hope, with organizers hoping it encourages dialogue and positive action across the country.</p>
