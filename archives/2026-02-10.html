    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 10, 2026</div>
    <h2>Crime and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>The FBI has released images of a masked individual as part of the search for the mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie, who went missing from her home in Tucson, Arizona, on the night of January 31. Authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding her disappearance, highlighting an ongoing missing person case.</p>
<p>In legal news related to transparency, two U.S. lawmakers—Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna—have accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) of improperly redacting files connected to Jeffrey Epstein. They argue the DOJ is not complying with laws that require transparency, reflecting continuing concerns over the handling of sensitive legal documents linked to Epstein's case.</p>
<h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Kenya has announced it will confront Russia over the "unacceptable" use of Kenyan nationals in combat. Nairobi has already shut down illegal recruiters and plans to urge Moscow to sign an agreement banning forced conscription of its citizens. This move signals Kenya’s determination to protect its nationals and address exploitation in global conflicts.</p>
<p>In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron has issued a call for the continent to begin acting as a unified world power. Macron warned that Europe faces increasing threats not only from China and Russia but now also from the United States, describing this as a "wake-up call." His statement suggests a push for greater European strategic independence and engagement on the global stage.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Public Figures</h2>
<p>Singer Chappell Roan has left the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman, following revelations in the Epstein files that Wasserman exchanged flirtatious emails with Ghislaine Maxwell. This development ties entertainment industry repercussions to the broader Epstein scandal.</p>
<p>At the Winter Olympics, Norwegian biathlete Sturla Holm Laegreid won a bronze medal but later made headlines by confessing live on television to having an affair, calling it his "biggest mistake." The incident has drawn public attention beyond his athletic achievements.</p>
<h2>Safety and Emergencies</h2>
<p>A Somali passenger plane crash-landed near a shoreline after failing to reach the runway. The pilot was praised for safely managing the emergency landing, with all 55 people on board surviving. This incident highlights the critical role of skilled piloting in averting potential disasters.</p>
<h2>Technology and Society</h2>
<p>In Los Angeles, a landmark jury trial examining social media addiction is underway. Owners of Instagram and YouTube are being scrutinized over allegations that their platforms were deliberately built as "addiction machines." This trial may have significant implications for how social media companies design their products and address user well-being in the future.</p>
<h2>Legal Charges in Historical Abuse Case</h2>
<p>French authorities have charged Jacques Leveugle, a former teacher, with abusing 89 teenagers dating back to the 1960s. Leveugle reportedly kept a diary documenting the abuse, which extended across several countries. Police have called for additional victims to come forward, underscoring ongoing efforts to confront historical abuse cases.</p>
