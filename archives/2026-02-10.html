    <h2>Missing Person Case in Arizona</h2>
<p>The FBI is actively searching for the mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie, who disappeared recently from her home in Tucson, Arizona. She was last seen on January 31st and went missing during the night. Authorities have released images of a masked individual as part of the investigation, though it remains unclear if this person is connected to the disappearance. The case has drawn public attention given the connection to a well-known media figure.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Updates</h2>
<p>In Zimbabwe, there is a proposal to extend the presidential term of Emmerson Mnangagwa beyond the scheduled end in 2028. A new bill could allow the current president to remain in office longer, which may have implications for the country's political future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, Trump’s commerce secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that he visited Jeffrey Epstein’s private island in 2012 for lunch. This statement contradicts previous claims by Lutnick that he severed ties with Epstein in 2005. The revelation comes amid ongoing scrutiny of associations with Epstein.</p>
<p>Also in the U.S., former talent agency client Chappell Roan has exited an agency led by Casey Wasserman, after emails surfaced showing Wasserman’s flirtatious correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell, a key figure in the Epstein case. This development is part of the continuing fallout surrounding Epstein’s network.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called on Europe to adopt a more assertive global stance, citing increasing threats from China, Russia, and the United States. He warned that Europe is facing a "wake-up call" and needs to start acting like a world power, reflecting growing geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>Additionally, former US President Trump has threatened to block the opening of a new US-Canada bridge despite a recent “positive” phone call with Canadian official Mark Carney. The White House continues to push for certain demands even as diplomatic talks progress.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Sports</h2>
<p>At the Winter Olympics, Norwegian athlete Sturla Holm Laegreid, who won a bronze medal, made headlines for admitting on live television that he had cheated on his girlfriend, calling it his "biggest mistake." This personal confession came shortly after his sporting success.</p>
<p>In aviation news, a pilot successfully crash-landed a passenger plane off the shore of Somalia after it malfunctioned. All 55 people on board survived the incident, and the pilot was praised for his skill in handling the emergency landing on the shoreline rather than the runway.</p>
<h2>Criminal Cases</h2>
<p>In France, a former teacher named Jacques Leveugle has been charged with abusing 89 teenagers dating back to the 1960s. Investigators say Leveugle allegedly kept a diary documenting the abuse, which reportedly occurred across several countries. Police have called for additional victims to come forward as part of an ongoing investigation.</p>
