    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 10, 2026</div>
    <h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently jailed and was an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, refused to answer questions about Epstein in a recent congressional hearing. A video shared by members of Congress showed her declining to provide information regarding the late sex offender.</p>
<p>In another political matter involving infrastructure, former US President Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge. The bridge is scheduled to open this year and connects Michigan in the United States with Ontario in Canada.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Tech Industry Scrutiny</h2>
<p>A landmark trial is underway in Los Angeles scrutinizing the major tech companies behind Instagram and YouTube for allegedly creating "addiction machines." The court is examining the role these platforms play in encouraging addictive social media behavior among users.</p>
<h2>Crime and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Savannah Guthrie, a TV host, made a heartfelt video plea for help in finding her missing mother. The appeal was broadcast just hours before a reported ransom deadline passed, as those believed to be holding her mother demanded payment.</p>
<p>In Australia, police defended their conduct after videos emerged showing officers punching protesters and forcibly removing men who were praying during a rally. The protest was related to the visit of the Israeli president and raised concerns about police response to demonstrations.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Issues</h2>
<p>The Philippine Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling allowing same-sex couples to co-own property. The decision emphasized that "legitimate intimate relationships" should not be legally invisible, marking progress for LGBTQ+ rights in the country.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, an Australian author’s erotic novel was legally determined to be child sex abuse material. The book featured an 18-year-old protagonist who role-played as a toddler, leading to the judge's classification of the content as illegal.</p>
<h2>Business and Economy</h2>
<p>Energy giant BP reported a drop in profits following a decline in oil prices. The company also announced it is suspending its share buyback program ahead of the arrival of its new leadership, signaling a period of financial adjustment.</p>
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<p>The cause of death for actress Catherine O'Hara has been confirmed as a blood clot. The actress, known for her roles in "Schitt's Creek" and "Home Alone," passed away last month at the age of 71 in a US hospital.</p>
