    <h2>Developments in the Epstein Investigation</h2>
<p>A former police chief recalled that in 2006, Donald Trump reportedly contacted Florida police during their investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The ex-police chief said Trump expressed relief, saying, "thank goodness you're stopping him," and suggested that "everyone" was aware of Epstein's behaviour at the time. This statement adds to the ongoing public discussion about the extent of knowledge and response to Epstein’s criminal activities in previous years.</p>
<h2>International Political Updates</h2>
<p>In Zimbabwe, a bill has been introduced that could allow President Mnangagwa to extend his term beyond its scheduled end in 2028. This development has implications for the country's political future and its governance structure.</p>
<p>In Europe, the French president warned about increasing geopolitical threats from China, Russia, and the United States. He urged European nations to act more decisively and collectively as a global power. This reflects growing concerns about Europe's position and influence in an evolving global landscape.</p>
<h2>Security and Human Interest</h2>
<p>The FBI has released images of a masked individual in connection to the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's mother. She was last seen on 31 January at her home in Tucson, Arizona. Authorities are actively seeking information from the public to assist in locating her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Somalia, a passenger plane experienced a landing failure near a shoreline but was safely crash-landed by the pilot. All 55 people on board survived, and the pilot has received praise for managing the emergency without loss of life.</p>
<h2>Sports and Entertainment</h2>
<p>At the Winter Olympics, medal-winning athlete Sturla Holm Laegreid publicly admitted to an extramarital affair during a live television broadcast. He described the situation as his "biggest mistake," which has drawn attention to his personal life amidst his sporting success.</p>
<p>In the entertainment world, singer Chappell Roan has left a talent agency after emails connected to its leader Casey Wasserman were revealed in the Epstein files. These emails included flirtatious messages to Ghislaine Maxwell, adding to the fallout from the Epstein scandal.</p>
<h2>Crime and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>In France, Jacques Leveugle, a former teacher, has been charged with sexually abusing 89 teenagers from the 1960s onwards. Authorities found a diary purportedly documenting the abuse, which allegedly occurred across several countries. Police have appealed for additional victims to come forward to aid the investigation.</p>
