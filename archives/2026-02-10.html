    <h2>US and Epstein-Related News</h2>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, a jailed associate of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, refused to answer questions about Epstein during a recent congressional hearing. A video of Maxwell's non-responsiveness was released by members of Congress. Additionally, controversy around Epstein's network continues, with emails from talent agency leader Casey Wasserman, showing flirtatious exchanges with Maxwell, becoming public. This revelation led to singer Chappell Roan leaving Wasserman’s agency.</p>
<h2>US-Canada Relations and Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Tensions surfaced between the US and Canada over the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which links Michigan and Ontario. The bridge is scheduled to open this year, but former US president Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening, signaling ongoing political challenges concerning this important cross-border infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Global Politics and Security</h2>
<p>French president Emmanuel Macron called on Europe to become more assertive on the world stage. He warned of increasing geopolitical threats from China, Russia, and the US, framing the situation as a “wake-up call” for Europe to strengthen its global influence. Meanwhile, Kenya is confronting Russia over allegations that Russian forces are unlawfully conscripting Kenyan nationals for combat. Nairobi has shut down illegal recruitment efforts and plans to urge Moscow to agree to a formal ban on such conscription.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Technology Scrutiny</h2>
<p>Instagram and YouTube, owned by major tech companies, are facing a landmark jury trial in Los Angeles focused on social media addiction. The trial examines whether these platforms deliberately designed their services to be addictive, putting these tech giants under increased scrutiny for their role in users’ mental health and social behaviors.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Headlines</h2>
<p>Savannah Guthrie publicly pleaded for the safe return of her 84-year-old mother, who is reportedly being held for ransom, as the payment deadline passed without resolution. Also, in entertainment news, actress Catherine O’Hara, known for her work in *Schitt's Creek* and *Home Alone*, died last month at age 71; her cause of death was confirmed as a blood clot.</p>
<p>In Australia, police defended their actions after violent clashes at a protest against the visit of the Israeli president. Videos from the event showed officers using force to remove protesters and individuals praying.</p>
<p>Lastly, British oil company BP announced cost-cutting measures after a slide in profits. The company also suspended its share buyback program as preparations continue for the arrival of a new chief executive.</p>
