    <h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is jailed in connection to Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, appeared in a congressional hearing where she refused to answer questions about Epstein. Video footage released by members of Congress showed her declining to provide information regarding the late sex offender. Meanwhile, controversy continues around Epstein's network as revealed emails showed Casey Wasserman, who heads a talent agency, exchanging flirtatious messages with Maxwell; this led singer Chappell Roan to leave Wasserman's agency.</p>
<p>In the United States, President Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which connects Michigan to Ontario. The bridge is scheduled to open later this year, but Trump’s opposition creates uncertainty for this important cross-border infrastructure project.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Human Rights</h2>
<p>In Australia, police have come under criticism after videos surfaced showing officers using force against protesters rallying during a visit by the Israeli president. These videos show police punching protesters and forcibly removing praying individuals. Authorities defended their actions, but the incident has sparked discussions about policing tactics and protest rights.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, the top court issued a landmark ruling that allows same-sex couples to co-own property. The court emphasized that “legitimate intimate relationships” deserve legal recognition and should not be rendered “legally invisible.” This decision is seen as a significant step for LGBTQ+ rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Crime</h2>
<p>Television host Savannah Guthrie made a public plea for help locating her missing mother as a reported ransom deadline passed. This appeal came amid fears and uncertainty about the safety of her mother, who is believed to be held by kidnappers.</p>
<p>Additionally, an Australian author faced legal condemnation after a judge ruled that their erotic novel qualified as child sex abuse material. The novel featured an 18-year-old protagonist engaged in toddler role-playing, raising significant controversy over its content.</p>
<h2>Technology and Economy</h2>
<p>Tech giants Instagram and YouTube are currently facing a jury trial in Los Angeles that is examining their role in fostering social media addiction. The trial is a key moment in holding the companies accountable for the design of their platforms, which plaintiffs argue are engineered to be highly addictive.</p>
<p>In business news, oil giant BP reported a fall in profits attributed to lower oil prices. In response, BP announced it is suspending its share buyback programme while preparing for the arrival of a new chief executive. This move signals a period of transition for the company amid volatile market conditions.</p>
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<p>The cause of death for actress Catherine O’Hara, known for her work in "Schitt’s Creek" and "Home Alone," has been confirmed as a blood clot. She passed away last month in a US hospital at the age of 71. Her death marks a notable loss in the entertainment industry given her long and admired career.</p>
