    <h2>US Justice Department Faces Criticism Over Epstein Files</h2>
<p>Two US lawmakers, Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, have accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) of "inappropriately" redacting documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. They claim the DOJ is not complying with a transparency law aimed at making the files public in full. The controversy raises ongoing concerns about government openness and accountability in high-profile legal cases.</p>
<h2>European Leadership and Global Challenges</h2>
<p>French president Emmanuel Macron has called on Europe to start acting more decisively as a major world power. He highlighted increasing threats from China, Russia, and even the United States, warning that Europe is experiencing a "wake-up call." Macron’s message underscores the shifting dynamics in international relations and the pressure on Europe to bolster its strategic and diplomatic influence.</p>
<h2>Kenya to Address Russian Use of Kenyan Nationals in Combat</h2>
<p>Kenya has announced it will confront Russia over what it calls the "unacceptable" use of Kenyan nationals in combat roles. The Kenyan government reports having shut down illegal recruitment activities and plans to urge Moscow to sign an agreement banning such conscription practices. This development points to growing tensions and concerns related to Russian military activities abroad.</p>
<h2>Tensions over US-Canada Bridge Opening</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, a critical infrastructure project connecting Michigan and Ontario. The bridge is scheduled to open this year and represents a key transit link between the United States and Canada. Trump's stance introduces uncertainty about the project's imminent completion and future cross-border transportation.</p>
<h2>Social Media Addiction Under Legal Scrutiny</h2>
<p>Owners of Instagram and YouTube are facing a landmark jury trial in Los Angeles focused on allegations that they built "addiction machines." The trial examines whether these tech giants deliberately designed their platforms to foster addictive social media use. The case could have significant implications for how social media companies operate and regulate content in the future.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Developments</h2>
<p>Savannah Guthrie issued a heartfelt video plea regarding the ongoing kidnapping situation involving her 84-year-old mother, coinciding with a reported ransom deadline passing. Meanwhile, a group of 19 Buddhist monks is concluding their 108-day silent Walk for Peace in Washington DC, promoting nonviolence in the US. In entertainment news, Catherine O’Hara’s cause of death has been confirmed as a blood clot; the actress was 71. Lastly, singer Marc Anthony addressed recent reports about a feud involving David Beckham, calling the coverage misleading.</p>
