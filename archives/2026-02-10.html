    <h2>Epstein Investigation and Related Controversies</h2>
<p>A former police chief in Florida has said that Donald Trump told him in 2006 that "everyone" was aware of Jeffrey Epstein's behaviour. According to the chief, Trump called police while they were investigating Epstein and said, "thank goodness you're stopping him." This revelation adds to ongoing discussions about Epstein's case and those connected to it. Additionally, Casey Wasserman, a talent agency leader, has come under scrutiny following the release of flirtatious emails he sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, a close associate of Epstein. In response to the fallout, singer Chappell Roan has left Wasserman's agency.</p>
<h2>Search for Missing Person in Arizona</h2>
<p>The FBI has released images of a masked individual amid efforts to find the mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie. She disappeared in the middle of the night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and was last seen on January 31. Authorities continue to investigate the case, appealing for public assistance in locating her.</p>
<h2>International Politics: Europe and Zimbabwe</h2>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called on Europe to begin acting like a global power. He warned of mounting challenges posed by China, Russia, and the United States, describing the situation as a "wake-up call" for the continent. Meanwhile, in Zimbabwe, there is a new effort to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwa's term. His current term is set to end in 2028, but a proposed bill could allow him to remain in office longer.</p>
<h2>Aviation Incident in Somalia</h2>
<p>A passenger plane in Somalia crash-landed near the seashore after failing to reach the runway properly. The pilot was praised for managing the emergency landing safely. All 55 people on board survived the incident without serious injury, highlighting the pilot's skill and quick thinking during the unexpected event.</p>
<h2>Sports and Personal Admission</h2>
<p>At the Winter Olympics, Sturla Holm Laegreid won a bronze medal. During a live television interview, he confessed to having an affair, describing it as the "biggest mistake" of his life. The public confession has sparked conversation beyond his athletic achievements.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Developments</h2>
<p>A French former teacher, Jacques Leveugle, has been charged with abusing 89 teenagers across multiple countries, with allegations dating back to the 1960s. Police are encouraging additional victims to come forward. In entertainment news, singer Marc Anthony responded to reports about a feud with David Beckham, calling the portrayal "hardly the truth." Anthony had performed at Beckham's wedding reception in 2022. Lastly, former US President Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of a US-Canada bridge despite a reportedly "positive" phone call with Canadian official Mark Carney, signaling ongoing tensions over the project.</p>
