    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 10, 2026</div>
    <h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is jailed as an associate of the late Jeffrey Epstein, appeared in a congressional hearing where she refused to answer questions about Epstein. This refusal comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Epstein’s criminal network and those connected to him. Additionally, Chappell Roan, a performer, has left a talent agency led by Casey Wasserman after emails revealing Wasserman’s flirtatious communication with Maxwell surfaced in the Epstein files.</p>
<p>In other news related to US infrastructure, President Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge. This new bridge, expected to open later this year, will connect Michigan and Ontario, enhancing cross-border transport and trade.</p>
<h2>Social and Human Rights Updates</h2>
<p>A significant ruling from the Philippine Supreme Court has granted same-sex couples the right to co-own property. The court emphasized that "legitimate intimate relationships" should not be legally invisible, marking a step forward in recognizing property rights for same-sex couples.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Australia, police defended their actions after protests turned violent during a visit by the Israeli president. Videos from the event showed officers physically engaging with protesters, including punching and dragging men away while they were praying. The police maintain their stance despite public and media scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Crisis: Savannah Guthrie's Mother's Kidnapping</h2>
<p>Television presenter Savannah Guthrie issued a video plea as a ransom deadline passed concerning her 84-year-old mother’s kidnapping. The appeal, made on the same day as the reported deadline to pay the captors, highlighted the urgent and unresolved nature of the situation. The public remains attentive to further developments in this case.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Legal Pressures on Tech and Oil Industries</h2>
<p>In Los Angeles, a landmark jury trial is examining allegations that Instagram and YouTube have created "addiction machines" to hook users on their social media platforms. The case is part of wider scrutiny over tech companies' role in social media addiction and its societal impact.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BP, the global oil company, announced plans to increase cost-cutting measures as profits decline. The company has also suspended its share buyback program ahead of the arrival of a new CEO. These moves signal strategic shifts and financial caution amid changing energy markets.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>The cause of death for actress Catherine O’Hara, known for roles in "Schitt’s Creek" and "Home Alone," has been confirmed as a blood clot. She passed away last month at a hospital in the United States at the age of 71.</p>
<p>In Australia, a judge ruled that an erotic novel by an Australian author qualifies as child sex abuse material. The novel featured an 18-year-old character role-playing as a toddler, and this ruling raises ongoing questions about artistic expression and legal boundaries.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories highlight ongoing legal proceedings, social justice movements, challenges in public safety, and shifts in industries, all of which contribute to the current news landscape.</p>
