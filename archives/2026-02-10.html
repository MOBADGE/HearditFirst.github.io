    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 10, 2026</div>
    <h2>Crime and Investigations</h2>
<p>A former police chief has said that in 2006, Donald Trump told Florida police officers investigating Jeffrey Epstein that "everyone" knew about Epstein's behaviour and expressed relief that the police were stopping him. This revelation adds to ongoing discussions about Epstein's criminal activities and who knew about them at the time.</p>
<p>In France, Jacques Leveugle, a former teacher, has been charged with the abuse of 89 teenagers dating back to the 1960s. It is reported that Leveugle kept a diary detailing the abuse, which spanned multiple countries. Authorities are encouraging any additional victims to come forward as the investigation continues.</p>
<h2>Missing Person Case</h2>
<p>The FBI has released images of a masked individual in connection with the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s mother from her home in Tucson, Arizona. She was last seen on 31 January. The release is part of the ongoing search efforts to locate her and bring clarity to the case.</p>
<h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called on Europe to act more like a global power, warning of increasing threats from China, Russia, and the United States. He described the current situation as a "wake-up call" and stressed the importance of a stronger European response to international challenges.</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe, President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s term is scheduled to end in 2028, but a proposed bill could allow him to extend his time in office. This move is part of ongoing political developments in the country with potential implications for its future governance.</p>
<p>Additionally, Venezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa was recaptured by security forces after being freed briefly, according to reports from his son. Guanipa had been released along with other political prisoners before his re-arrest, highlighting continuing political tensions in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Heroism</h2>
<p>A Somali passenger plane crash-landed on a shoreline after a failed runway landing, but all 55 people on board survived. The pilot received praise for safely bringing the faulty aircraft down without any fatalities, an effort that prevented what could have been a major disaster.</p>
<h2>Sports and Entertainment</h2>
<p>At the Winter Olympics, bronze medallist Sturla Holm Laegreid publicly confessed on live television to having an affair, calling it the "biggest mistake" he has made. This personal revelation came shortly after his sporting success.</p>
<p>In entertainment news, singer Chappell Roan has parted ways with the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman following revelations in the Epstein case, which included emails showing flirtatious messages from Wasserman to Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>Lastly, Marc Anthony addressed ongoing narratives about his feud with David Beckham, describing much of what has been said as "hardly the truth." Anthony previously performed at the wedding reception of Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham in 2022.</p>
