    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 31, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Conflicts and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions continue in Eastern Europe as Russia released a video claiming to show a Ukrainian drone attack targeting one of Vladimir Putin's residences. However, the European Union’s top diplomat has rejected these claims, denying that Ukraine launched attacks on Russian government sites. This dispute highlights ongoing conflict narratives in the region with information contested by both sides.</p>
<p>In Finland, police have seized a ship suspected of involvement in sabotage on an undersea cable. The vessel was sailing from St Petersburg, Russia, to the Israeli port of Haifa. Authorities have arrested 14 crew members as investigations proceed. This incident raises concerns about critical infrastructure security in sensitive geopolitical areas.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Israel has moved to bar 37 international aid organizations from operating under new registration rules. Ten countries, including the United Kingdom and members of the European Union, have criticized these restrictions as "restrictive" and "unacceptable," warning of severe impacts on humanitarian aid in Gaza. This escalation will likely affect the flow of international assistance during a time of ongoing humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Iran, protests continue with unrest escalating in the city of Fasa, where demonstrators forcibly broke into the governor’s office. Verified video footage shows crowds breaching government premises, reflecting persistent instability and public dissent in the country.</p>
<h2>Asia-Pacific and China’s Birthrate Policy</h2>
<p>China has implemented a significant tax policy change as part of efforts to address its birthrate decline. Starting 1 January, contraceptives will be subjected to a 13% sales tax, while childcare services will be exempt from this tax. The government’s approach reflects attempts to balance population control measures with incentives that support families and childcare affordability.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, concerns over human rights and detainee welfare have been raised. The daughter of Jimmy Lai, a jailed tycoon, has reported to the BBC that her father’s health is deteriorating in prison, with symptoms including rotting teeth and falling fingernails. This adds to ongoing scrutiny of prison conditions and human rights in the region.</p>
<h2>Europe and Currency Changes</h2>
<p>Bulgaria has officially joined the eurozone, adopting the euro as its national currency. The decision has split public opinion in the country. Supporters view it as a bold step toward further economic integration and growth, while opponents fear it could lead to economic stagnation. The transition marks a major milestone for Bulgaria’s financial alignment with the European Union.</p>
<h2>Public Events and Tragedies</h2>
<p>Sydney marked New Year's Eve with a powerful message of peace and unity following a recent attack at Bondi Beach. The words "peace" and "unity" were projected onto the Sydney Harbour Bridge as thousands gathered to watch the annual fireworks display, signaling hopes for harmony and recovery.</p>
<p>In Peru, a train crash on the single-track line to Machu Picchu resulted in the death of the train driver and injuries to at least 40 passengers. The cause of the crash is under investigation. This tragic event highlights ongoing safety concerns in popular tourist regions.</p>
<h2>Notable Death and Mourning</h2>
<p>In Bangladesh, thousands have gathered in Dhaka for the state funeral of Khaleda Zia, the country’s first female prime minister, who passed away at age 80. The large turnout reflects her lasting political legacy and the country's respect for her role in shaping Bangladesh's history.</p>
