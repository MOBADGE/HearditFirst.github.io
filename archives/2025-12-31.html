    <h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Tensions continue between Russia and Ukraine as Russia released a video purporting to show a Ukrainian drone attack near one of Vladimir Putin's residences. The European Union's top diplomat dismissed these Russian claims, rejecting the account of Ukrainian attacks on government sites. This development highlights ongoing conflict narratives in the region and the persistent diplomatic challenge in verifying incidents amid the Ukraine-Russia conflict.</p>
<h2>Social Policy and Economic Change in China</h2>
<p>China has implemented a new policy affecting contraceptives and childcare in an effort to influence birth rates. From January 1, a 13% sales tax on contraceptives was introduced, while childcare services are now exempt from such taxes. This shift signals a strategic attempt to encourage higher birth rates by reducing the cost burden of raising children while making contraceptives more expensive.</p>
<h2>Bulgaria Adopts the Euro Currency</h2>
<p>Bulgaria has officially joined the eurozone, adopting the euro as its new currency after a complex and challenging transition. The decision has sparked mixed reactions across the country; some view it as a progressive step towards greater economic integration, while others worry it could lead to economic stagnation. The long-term effects will become clearer as Bulgaria navigates this significant monetary change.</p>
<h2>Protests and Unrest in Iran</h2>
<p>Unrest continues in Iran as protesters forcefully attempted to enter government buildings, including breaking the gate of the governor’s office in the city of Fasa. Verified video footage shows the intensity of the demonstrations, reflecting ongoing political tensions and dissatisfaction among segments of the Iranian population.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Aid Concerns in Gaza</h2>
<p>Israel announced that it will bar 37 international aid groups from operating in Gaza under new registration rules. This move has drawn criticism from the United Kingdom, the European Union, and eight other countries who described the restrictions as "restrictive" and "unacceptable." The development raises serious concerns about the future delivery of humanitarian aid in the region and its impact on the population of Gaza.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>In Peru, a fatal train crash near the tourist site of Machu Picchu resulted in the death of a train driver and injuries to at least 40 passengers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Finnish police detained 14 crew members of a ship sailing from St Petersburg to the Israeli port of Haifa, suspecting involvement in sabotage of an undersea cable.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the daughter of jailed tycoon Jimmy Lai reported to the BBC that his health is declining in prison, citing issues like tooth decay and fingernail loss.</p>
<p>Commemorations are underway in Bangladesh where thousands gathered in Dhaka to mourn Khaleda Zia, the country's first female prime minister, who passed away at the age of 80.</p>
<p>In Australia, Sydney marked the New Year with a message of peace and unity projected on the Harbour Bridge, following a recent attack at Bondi Beach.</p>
