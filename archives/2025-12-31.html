    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 31, 2025</div>
    <h2>Transport and Travel</h2>
<p>Eurostar has resumed normal operations after a significant disruption in the Channel Tunnel, but the company advises passengers to check for possible last-minute delays or cancellations. Meanwhile, a train accident near Machu Picchu resulted in the death of the train driver and injuries to at least 40 people on the single-track line to the historic site.</p>
<h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Mali and Burkina Faso have imposed reciprocal travel bans on US citizens following the United States' announcement of full-entry restrictions on their nationals. This tit-for-tat move reflects rising tensions between these countries and the US. In Southeast Asia, Thailand released 18 Cambodian soldiers held since July as part of a new ceasefire agreement after several weeks of violent clashes along the Thai-Cambodia border.</p>
<h2>Health and Human Interest</h2>
<p>Rachel Reid, author of "Heated Rivalry," credits the success of the TV adaptation of her book with helping her connect with a Parkinson’s specialist, which has supported her health management. In sad news, Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of John F. Kennedy, has died at the age of 35. She had publicly shared her terminal cancer diagnosis just last month.</p>
<h2>Political Events and Leadership</h2>
<p>In Guinea, the junta leader has won the presidential election by a wide margin, securing a seven-year term. This outcome was expected and consolidates the current leadership’s control. Bangladesh mourned the loss of Khaleda Zia, the country’s first female prime minister, whose state funeral in Dhaka drew large crowds paying their respects.</p>
<h2>Prison Conditions</h2>
<p>The daughter of Jimmy Lai, a jailed Hong Kong businessman, has spoken to the BBC about her father’s deteriorating health in prison, mentioning symptoms such as teeth rotting and fingernails falling off. These remarks raise concerns about his treatment and well-being while incarcerated.</p>
<h2>Security and Military Actions</h2>
<p>The US president announced that American forces struck a "big facility" connected to alleged Venezuelan drug boats, though he did not confirm media reports suggesting the explosion resulted from a CIA drone strike. The incident reflects ongoing US efforts to counter drug trafficking operations in the region.</p>
