    <div class="date">January 21, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Trade and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The European Union has paused approval of a US trade deal amid heightened tensions between the two blocs. This development comes as Donald Trump advances efforts to acquire Greenland, a move that has exacerbated disagreements. The suspension may complicate economic relations and slow progress on transatlantic trade negotiations.</p>
<p>Separately, Donald Trump’s new organization, the Board of Peace, has gained the support of seven additional Muslim-majority countries. These states join the existing members, which include Albania, Bahrain, Hungary, Morocco, and Israel. The growth of this group reflects ongoing attempts to build regional cooperation, though the overall impact remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Middle East Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>A recent Israeli strike in Gaza resulted in the deaths of three journalists, according to first responders, with medics reporting eight additional Palestinian casualties from artillery and gunfire across Gaza. This escalation underscores the persistent violence affecting civilians and media personnel in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States plans to transfer Islamic State prisoners from Syria to Iraq. This action follows advances by Syrian government forces into north-eastern territories previously under Kurdish-led control, indicating shifting power dynamics in the area and ongoing efforts to manage detainees connected to terrorism.</p>
<p>In the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, Israeli authorities have postponed the demolition of a Palestinian children’s football pitch. An international campaign to save the pitch appears to have influenced this decision, highlighting the role of global advocacy in local disputes.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Protest Crackdown</h2>
<p>In Iran, leaked photos from a Tehran mortuary have revealed faces of hundreds killed during a severe government crackdown on protests. Families viewing the images have been identifying their lost loved ones, shedding light on the scale and human cost of the unrest. These revelations may intensify international scrutiny of Iran’s response to dissent.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Safety</h2>
<p>Spain continues to grapple with railway safety concerns after a second deadly crash in days. One train driver died in the latest incident, and at least 37 individuals were injured, five seriously. This follows a recent two-train collision in Andalusia, prompting calls for enhanced rail safety measures.</p>
<h2>Energy and Environment</h2>
<p>Japan has restarted a reactor at the world’s largest nuclear plant, nearly 15 years after the Fukushima meltdown. This marks a significant step in the country’s energy policy, balancing the need for power supply with lingering public concerns tied to the disaster’s legacy. Future developments will be closely watched for their impact on nuclear energy acceptance.</p>
<h2>Science and Culture</h2>
<p>Researchers have identified the world’s oldest known cave painting, a red clawed hand outline found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. This discovery could revise current understanding of the timeline and development of human creativity, opening new avenues in the study of ancient art and culture.</p>
