    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 21, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>Tensions continue in the US Congress over a proposal related to Greenland. Some Republicans are opposing the president's plans to take control of the island, but it remains uncertain whether they will join Democrats to block the move. The situation highlights divisions within the president’s own party and raises questions about future policy on Greenland.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>Israel has joined a new organisation called the Board of Peace, initiated by the US, accepting an invitation alongside countries like Albania, Bahrain, Hungary, Morocco, and the UAE. This marks the latest participation from the region in the initiative, which aims to address peace and cooperation. In related news, Israeli authorities have postponed the demolition of a football pitch used by Palestinian children in Bethlehem following an international campaign, reflecting sensitivities around community spaces in the occupied West Bank.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict</h2>
<p>Images recently leaked by the BBC show hundreds of people killed during protests in Iran. Families viewed these photos at a mortuary in Tehran in an effort to identify their loved ones. The brutal crackdown has drawn international attention, underscoring ongoing unrest and government suppression in the country.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Accidents</h2>
<p>Spain has experienced a second deadly rail crash within a few days, resulting in the death of a train driver and injuring at least 37 people, five seriously. This follows a recent collision between two trains in Andalusia, raising concerns about rail safety and prompting calls for investigation into the causes.</p>
<p>An Air India plane involved in a crash has been reported by campaigners to have a history of technical problems, including a previous fire. These claims add to scrutiny over airline safety practices and maintenance standards.</p>
<h2>Global Nuclear Energy</h2>
<p>Japan has restarted a nuclear reactor at the world's largest nuclear plant nearly 15 years after the Fukushima disaster. This step reflects Japan’s efforts to balance energy needs with safety concerns, as memories of the meltdown continue to influence public and government decision-making.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, police confirmed the mass abduction of more than 160 people from three churches in Kaduna state after earlier denying reports. This development highlights ongoing security challenges in northern Nigeria.</p>
<p>In Japan, a man received a life sentence for the killing of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The assassination was a shocking event in a country known for its low rates of gun violence.</p>
