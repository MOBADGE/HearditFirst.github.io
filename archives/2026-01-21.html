    <h2>Transatlantic Tensions Affect EU-US Relations</h2>
<p>The European Union has suspended approval of a pending US trade deal amid growing strain between the two sides. This pause comes as former US President Donald Trump pushes efforts to acquire Greenland, a move sparking unease in Europe. With an emergency EU meeting planned in Brussels for Thursday, European leaders are under pressure to respond to Trump's provocations, which are testing transatlantic relationships. How Europe will proceed remains to be seen, but this disruption highlights ongoing friction between the US and its European partners.</p>
<h2>Middle East Updates: Violence and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>In Gaza, an Israeli strike has killed three journalists, with another eight Palestinians killed by artillery and gunfire on Wednesday, according to medical sources. Meanwhile, Israel has postponed the demolition of a Palestinian children’s football pitch in Bethlehem, following an international campaign that pressured authorities to reconsider the planned destruction.</p>
<p>On another front, seven Muslim-majority countries have agreed to join a new organisation called the Board of Peace, initiated by Donald Trump. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also indicated he is considering joining. These developments point to shifting diplomatic dynamics in the region, but the ongoing violence in Gaza underscores persistent challenges to peace and stability.</p>
<h2>US Security and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>The US plans to transfer Islamic State prisoners from Syria to Iraq as Syrian government forces seize control of territories formerly held by Kurdish-led groups in the northeast. This move is part of broader shifts in control within Syria and could impact regional security and the handling of detainees linked to the extremist group.</p>
<p>In legal news, Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker, is set to testify before the US Congress as part of the ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s activities. Maxwell has previously stated she might refuse to answer questions unless granted immunity, so her cooperation remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Additionally, the US Supreme Court expressed skepticism over the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. A conservative justice cautioned that the White House’s interpretation of the law might threaten the Federal Reserve’s independence, signaling potential legal challenges ahead.</p>
<h2>Science and Culture Highlights</h2>
<p>Researchers have identified the world's oldest known cave painting—a stencilled red claw hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. This discovery could change our understanding of the timeline of human creativity, suggesting that early artistic expression dates back much further than previously believed.</p>
<p>In music, pop superstar Taylor Swift has been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame as part of the 2026 class. She joins eight other songwriters in this recognition, marking a milestone in her career and celebrating songwriting achievements in the industry.</p>
