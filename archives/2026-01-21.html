    <h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and the European Union have increased recently, largely connected to Donald Trump's reported interest in acquiring Greenland. As a result, the EU has suspended approval of a US trade deal, reflecting strained diplomatic relations. Ahead of an emergency EU meeting scheduled in Brussels, European leaders face pressure to respond to these developments and assess future dealings with the US.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump has expanded his new organisation called the Board of Peace by inviting seven Muslim-majority countries to join. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he is considering whether to join the Board. This indicates ongoing efforts by Trump to build international partnerships outside of formal state mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Middle East Conflict and Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>Violence continues in Gaza, where an Israeli strike recently killed three journalists, according to first responders. Medics reported that eight additional Palestinians died from Israeli artillery and gunfire in various parts of Gaza on the same day. In the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, Israeli authorities postponed the demolition of a Palestinian children’s football pitch. This change came after an international campaign aimed at protecting the pitch, highlighting the role of global advocacy in local conflict zones.</p>
<p>In Syria and Iraq, the US is transferring Islamic State prisoners from Syrian custody to Iraq. This move is linked to shifting territorial control, as Syrian government forces have taken over parts of the northeast that were previously controlled by Kurdish-led forces.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court showed scepticism toward the firing of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook by the White House. One conservative justice expressed concern that the administration’s interpretation of the law could undermine the Federal Reserve’s independence, signaling a potentially significant legal debate about executive power and central banking autonomy.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted in relation to the Jeffrey Epstein case, is set to testify before the US Congress in an ongoing probe. She has previously stated she would not answer questions unless granted immunity, creating uncertainty about the scope and content of her testimony.</p>
<h2>Culture and Science</h2>
<p>In cultural news, Taylor Swift made history by becoming one of nine songwriters inducted into the 2026 Songwriters Hall of Fame. This milestone recognises her significant contributions to music as a US pop superstar.</p>
<p>In scientific research, a landmark discovery was made on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, where the world's oldest known cave painting was found. The image is a stencilled outline of a red claw hand, which could change current timelines about the origins of human creativity. This finding provides new insights into the early development of artistic expression in human history.</p>
