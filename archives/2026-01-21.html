    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 21, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Politics and International Relations</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump is pursuing the acquisition of Greenland, which has sparked debate within the US Congress. Some Republicans have voiced opposition to the move, but it remains uncertain whether they would join Democrats in formally blocking the takeover. This potential acquisition has also heightened tensions between the US and the European Union, contributing to the EU's decision to suspend approval of a US trade deal. The disagreement over Greenland exemplifies the strain in transatlantic relations and poses questions about future cooperation on trade and security.</p>
<h2>Transportation Safety in Spain and India</h2>
<p>Spain has experienced a second deadly train crash within days, resulting in at least 37 injuries, five of them serious. This follows a previous collision involving two trains in Andalusia. The incidents have raised concerns about rail safety and the circumstances leading to repeated accidents in the region.</p>
<p>In India, campaigners have raised alarms over the safety record of the aircraft involved in a recent Air India crash. They claim the plane had a history of technical failures, including a fire, before the accident. These safety concerns may prompt closer scrutiny of airline maintenance practices and regulatory oversight.</p>
<h2>Developments in Japan</h2>
<p>Japan has restarted a reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in the world. This restart comes nearly 15 years after the Fukushima disaster, marking a significant shift in Japan's energy policy. The move reflects efforts to balance energy needs with safety concerns and may influence Japan's approach to nuclear power going forward.</p>
<p>Additionally, a man convicted of assassinating former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been sentenced to life in prison. The assassination shocked Japan, a country with very low levels of gun-related violence, and this sentencing brings closure to a high-profile case that impacted national security discussions.</p>
<h2>Security Issues in Nigeria and Uganda</h2>
<p>In northern Kaduna state, Nigeria, police have confirmed the abduction of over 160 people from three churches, after initially denying such incidents. The mass kidnappings highlight ongoing security challenges in the region and raise concerns about the safety of religious communities.</p>
<p>In Uganda, Kizza Besigye, a veteran opposition figure, is reported by his party to be critically ill in hospital. Authorities, however, state that he was taken to the hospital for a routine check-up. The differing accounts draw attention to the political tensions within Uganda and the health status of an important opposition leader.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Consumer Trends</h2>
<p>In the United States, an Indian couple won a $200,000 settlement in a case concerning "food racism" at a university. The dispute originated when the couple defended their right to heat palak paneer, a traditional dish, in a campus microwave. The case sheds light on cultural acceptance and inclusivity challenges faced by diverse communities in educational institutions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Trump has expressed enthusiasm for small, compact cars similar to those commonly used in Japan. He described these tiny vehicles as "amazing" and indicated a desire to bring them to the US market. Whether American consumers will embrace these smaller cars remains to be seen, but the interest indicates a potential shift in automotive trends.</p>
