    <h2>US-EU Relations and Greenland Dispute</h2>
<p>In Davos, the US president announced he would not use force to acquire Greenland, dropping previous tariff threats related to the island. This shift comes after recent NATO talks and ongoing tensions between the US and the European Union. In response to renewed friction, the EU has suspended approval of a US trade deal, signaling strained economic ties. European leaders are preparing for an emergency EU meeting in Brussels, where they will discuss the situation and consider their next steps following the US president’s controversial comments.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy and Peace Initiatives</h2>
<p>Seven Muslim-majority countries have agreed to join a new international group called the Board of Peace, initiated by the US president. This development marks a notable expansion of the group's membership. Meanwhile, Russia's leader has indicated he is considering joining the organisation. These moves suggest efforts to foster diplomatic engagement and peace dialogue among diverse nations, though details about the group's specific goals are limited.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Casualties in Gaza</h2>
<p>An Israeli strike in Gaza resulted in the deaths of three journalists, according to first responders. Additionally, medics reported that eight more Palestinians were killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday. These incidents highlight ongoing violence in the region and raise concerns about the impact on civilians and the safety of reporters covering the conflict.</p>
<h2>US Security and Prisoner Transfers</h2>
<p>The United States is transferring Islamic State prisoners from Syria to Iraq amid recent changes on the ground. Syrian government forces have taken control of northeastern areas that Kurdish-led groups previously held. This shift is part of broader regional security efforts and may affect the handling of detainees linked to extremist groups.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings in the Epstein Investigation</h2>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell is set to testify before the US Congress as part of an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s activities. Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker, had previously stated she would refuse to answer questions unless granted immunity. Her testimony could provide further insight into the case and influence ongoing legal and congressional inquiries.</p>
<h2>Cultural Discovery: Oldest Known Cave Painting</h2>
<p>Researchers have identified a stencilled outline of a red clawed hand on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island as the world’s oldest cave painting. This discovery may alter the understanding of early human creativity, pushing back the timeline of artistic expression in prehistoric times. The finding offers new evidence about the development of culture and symbolic thought among ancient humans.</p>
