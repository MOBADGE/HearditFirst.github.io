    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 21, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>Tensions are rising as US President Donald Trump pursues a plan to acquire Greenland, an initiative that has sparked concern among some members of the US Congress, including Republicans. It remains uncertain whether Congress will unite across party lines to block the move. This proposed takeover has also strained US relations with Europe, leading to the European Union's decision to suspend approval of a US trade deal amid the renewed tensions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to join a new international group called the Board of Peace, initiated by Trump. Israel’s participation makes it the latest country to publicly accept the invitation to this organization, which has drawn criticism and worries that it could challenge the role of the United Nations.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Newly released photos from a mortuary in Tehran have revealed the faces of hundreds killed during Iran’s recent crackdown on protests. These images were shown to families identifying their loved ones, highlighting the human cost of the unrest and the severity of the government response.</p>
<h2>Transportation Accidents in Spain</h2>
<p>Spain is dealing with the aftermath of a second deadly train crash within a few days. Following a collision between two trains in the Andalusia region on Sunday, a second accident has resulted in multiple injuries, including at least one train driver who has died. At least 37 people were hurt in the latest incident, with five said to be in serious condition.</p>
<h2>Safety Concerns in Aviation and Security Updates</h2>
<p>Campaigners have raised alarms about the Air India flight involved in a recent crash, presenting evidence of prior technical issues with the aircraft, including a fire. These safety concerns may prompt further investigations into aviation standards and oversight.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, authorities confirmed mass abductions following reports that more than 160 individuals were taken from three churches in Kaduna state. This confirmation comes after initial denials from the police, underlining ongoing security challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Japan’s Nuclear and Legal News</h2>
<p>Japan has restarted a reactor at the world’s largest nuclear plant, nearly 15 years after the Fukushima disaster. This marks a significant step in Japan’s energy policy while stirring memories of the 2011 meltdown.</p>
<p>On the legal front, a man convicted of assassinating former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe received a life sentence. Abe’s assassination deeply shocked Japan, a country known for its low levels of gun-related crime.</p>
