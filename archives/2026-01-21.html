    <h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US and the European Union have escalated recently, leading the EU to suspend approval of a US trade deal. This decision comes amid renewed strains linked to US efforts to acquire Greenland. An emergency EU meeting scheduled in Brussels aims to address these challenges. Meanwhile, seven Muslim-majority countries have agreed to join an organisation initiated by Donald Trump called the Board of Peace. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has also indicated he is considering membership, potentially expanding the group's influence.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Conflict persists in Gaza, where an Israeli strike killed three journalists, according to first responders. Additionally, eight more Palestinians were reported killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday, per medics. In the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, authorities have postponed the demolition of a Palestinian children’s football pitch following an international campaign to save it, reflecting ongoing tensions and activism in the area.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Politics and Law</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court has expressed scepticism regarding the firing of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook by Donald Trump. A conservative justice warned that the administration’s legal interpretation could risk undermining the Federal Reserve’s independence, a key principle in US economic governance. Separately, the US plans to transfer prisoners affiliated with the Islamic State from Syria to Iraq. This move follows the Syrian government regaining control of north-eastern regions formerly held by Kurdish-led forces.</p>
<h2>Science and Culture</h2>
<p>Researchers announced the discovery of the world’s oldest known cave painting on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The painting is a stencilled outline of a red clawed hand, suggesting a much earlier start to human creativity than previously understood. In the cultural sphere, American pop star Taylor Swift made history by being inducted into the 2026 Songwriters Hall of Fame, joining eight other songwriters celebrated for their contributions.</p>
<h2>Energy and Environment</h2>
<p>Japan has restarted a nuclear reactor at the world’s largest nuclear power plant, nearly 15 years after the Fukushima disaster. This development marks a significant step in Japan’s energy policy, reflecting efforts to balance energy needs with safety concerns lingering from the meltdown crisis. The restart may influence global discussions about the role of nuclear power in sustainable energy strategies.</p>
