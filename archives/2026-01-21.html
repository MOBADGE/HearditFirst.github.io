    <h2>European and US Relations Strain Ahead of EU Emergency Meeting</h2>
<p>Tensions have increased between the US and Europe as European leaders prepare for an emergency EU meeting in Brussels on Thursday. The friction is partly linked to Donald Trump’s recent move to acquire Greenland, which has unsettled many European officials. Against this backdrop, the EU has suspended the approval process of a US trade deal, signaling deeper diplomatic strains. How European leaders respond at the meeting may shape transatlantic relations in the near future.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments: Israeli Airstrike and Political Moves</h2>
<p>A recent Israeli strike in Gaza resulted in the deaths of three journalists, with additional casualties reported among Palestinians due to artillery and gunfire. Meanwhile, Israel has postponed its planned demolition of a Palestinian children’s football pitch in Bethlehem, likely influenced by an international campaign to save the site. In parallel regional news, seven more Muslim-majority countries have agreed to join Donald Trump’s newly formed “Board of Peace,” expanding the organisation’s membership alongside nations such as Albania, Bahrain, Hungary, Morocco, and Israel.</p>
<h2>US Military and Security Shifts in Syria and Iraq</h2>
<p>The US is transferring prisoners associated with the Islamic State from Syria to Iraq. This decision follows Syrian government forces regaining control over northeastern territories that were previously held by Kurdish-led groups. The transfer reflects ongoing shifts in security dynamics in the region and may impact future counterterrorism efforts.</p>
<h2>Japan Restarts World’s Largest Nuclear Plant</h2>
<p>Japan has restarted a reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant, 15 years after the catastrophic meltdown that led to widespread criticism and environmental concerns. The plant is the largest nuclear facility in the world, and its reopening marks a significant step in Japan’s energy policy. However, memories of the Fukushima disaster remain fresh and continue to influence public opinion and safety discussions around nuclear power.</p>
<h2>Cultural Discovery: Oldest Known Cave Painting Found</h2>
<p>Scientists have identified the world’s oldest known cave painting, a red stencilled outline of a hand, on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. This discovery could reshape understanding of the timeline for early human creativity and artistic expression. The finding offers new insights into how early humans may have communicated and expressed themselves tens of thousands of years ago.</p>
<h2>Transportation Tragedy in Spain</h2>
<p>Spain has experienced its second deadly rail crash within days. A train driver was killed and at least 37 passengers were injured, five of them seriously, in this latest accident following a recent two-train collision in Andalusia. Authorities are continuing investigations, and these incidents highlight ongoing safety challenges in the country’s railway system.</p>
<h2>US Supreme Court Questions Legality of Central Bank Dismissal</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court expressed scepticism regarding Donald Trump’s firing of the Federal Reserve’s central bank governor, Lisa Cook. One conservative justice warned that the administration’s legal stance could undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve. The case could have significant implications for the balance of power between the government and the country’s central banking system.</p>
