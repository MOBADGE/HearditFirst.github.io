    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 21, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has reiterated his interest in acquiring Greenland, emphasizing there is "no going back" on the matter as he prepared to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos. However, technical problems with Air Force One delayed his arrival. Meanwhile, heightened tensions linked to this desire have led Europe to suspend approval of a US trade deal, putting global markets on alert. The developments indicate potential shifts in US-European relations and trade negotiations in the near future.</p>
<h2>Transport Accidents in Spain</h2>
<p>Spain is grappling with the aftermath of a second deadly train crash in just days. At least 37 people were injured, with five in serious condition, following the latest incident. This comes shortly after a two-train collision on Sunday in Andalusia. The back-to-back accidents have raised concerns about train safety and emergency preparedness within the country's transportation system.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Pakistan</h2>
<p>A deadly fire tore through a busy shopping centre in Pakistan, leaving survivors with harrowing stories of locked exits, panic, and desperate calls for help. Eyewitness accounts reveal the chaos faced by shoppers trying to escape the blaze. The incident has spotlighted issues around fire safety regulations and building management in crowded public spaces.</p>
<h2>Legal Outcome in Japan</h2>
<p>In Japan, a man was sentenced to life imprisonment for the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The killing shocked the nation, which is known for its very low levels of gun violence. The sentencing marks a significant moment in Japan’s criminal justice response to a high-profile and unprecedented crime.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Culture</h2>
<p>In the United States, an Indian couple won a $200,000 settlement following a dispute over "food racism" at a university campus. The incident began when the couple defended their right to heat palak paneer in a campus microwave, highlighting challenges around cultural acceptance and inclusivity.</p>
<p>In the arts, director Kaouther Ben Hani spoke about her Oscar-nominated film, *The Voice of Hind Rajab*, which tells the story of a Palestinian girl killed in Gaza. The film serves as a way to confront feelings of helplessness through storytelling.</p>
<h2>Automotive Innovation</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has approved the introduction of tiny "Kei" cars—small vehicles popular in Japan—to the US market. The initiative prompts questions about how American consumers will respond to the compact cars, traditionally designed for narrower urban environments. The move signals an interest in diversifying automotive options and possibly addressing environmental or space concerns.</p>
