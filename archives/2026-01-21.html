    <h2>International Relations and US-EU Tensions</h2>
<p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, the US president announced he would no longer pursue tariffs or use force to take Greenland, easing recent tensions around the island's potential acquisition. This statement came after talks with NATO allies and marks a retreat from earlier aggressive rhetoric. Nonetheless, friction between the US and the European Union continues, with the EU suspending approval of a US trade deal amid renewed disputes. European leaders are under pressure ahead of an emergency EU meeting scheduled for Thursday in Brussels, where discussions will focus on how to respond to ongoing challenges with the US.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Violence remains a serious concern in Gaza, where an Israeli strike killed three journalists and eight other Palestinians, according to first responders and medical officials. Meanwhile, Israel has postponed the demolition of a children’s football pitch in Bethlehem following an international campaign to protect the site. In northern Syria, the US announced plans to transfer Islamic State prisoners from Kurdish-led areas, which Syrian government forces have recently recaptured, to Iraq. This move is part of ongoing efforts to manage the security situation after shifts in control in the region.</p>
<h2>New Peace Initiative and Global Participation</h2>
<p>Seven Muslim-majority countries have joined a new peace organisation launched by the US president, called the Board of Peace. Additionally, Russia’s leader is reportedly considering joining this initiative. The inclusion of these countries indicates a broadening effort to engage different regions in conflict resolution, although details about the organisation's goals and operations remain limited.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings in the US</h2>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted in a high-profile sex trafficking case, is set to testify before the US Congress as part of an investigation linked to Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell has previously stated she might refuse to answer questions without immunity. Her testimony could shed light on further aspects of the case, potentially influencing ongoing legal and political inquiries.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discoveries</h2>
<p>Researchers have identified the world’s oldest known cave painting on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The painting is a stencilled red outline of a hand and suggests that human creative expression dates back much further than previously thought. This discovery could rewrite timelines regarding the development of early human culture and artistic practice.</p>
