    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Donald Trump attracted mixed reactions during his recent speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, reflecting divisions on his approach to global issues, according to an economics editor present at the event. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and Europe continue to rise, with European leaders growing weary of Trump's criticisms ahead of an emergency EU meeting scheduled in Brussels. These developments follow Trump's controversial pursuit of Greenland, which contributed to the European Union's decision to suspend approval of a US trade deal, signaling a potential stall in transatlantic economic cooperation.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Trump's initiative to create a "Board of Peace" has gained traction, with seven Muslim-majority countries agreeing to join the organisation. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated he is considering membership, suggesting a broader, if unexpected, coalition. In the Middle East, violence persists as an Israeli strike in Gaza resulted in the deaths of three journalists, along with eight other Palestinians killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire. In the West Bank, Israel has postponed plans to demolish a Palestinian children's football pitch in Bethlehem after an international campaign advocating for its preservation, highlighting ongoing tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Counterterrorism</h2>
<p>The US has announced it will transfer prisoners affiliated with the Islamic State from Syria to Iraq. This decision follows intensified Syrian government control over northeastern regions previously dominated by Kurdish-led forces, marking a significant shift in the territorial and security landscape. The transfer is likely intended to manage detainees more effectively amid changing power dynamics in the region.</p>
<h2>US Legal and Economic Affairs</h2>
<p>In the United States, Ghislaine Maxwell is set to testify before Congress as part of the ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activities. Maxwell, who has been convicted of sex trafficking, had previously indicated she might refuse to answer questions unless granted immunity. Separately, the US Supreme Court expressed skepticism about the firing of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook. One conservative justice warned that the administration's interpretation of the law guiding such firings could undermine the Federal Reserve's independence, hinting at potential legal challenges ahead.</p>
<h2>Science and Culture</h2>
<p>Researchers have made a significant archaeological discovery on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi—the world's oldest known cave painting. The stencilled outline of a hand with red claw marks suggests early human creativity may date back further than previously thought, potentially rewriting current theories about the development of artistic expression in prehistoric humans. This discovery sheds new light on the origins of cultural behavior and the spread of early human populations.</p>
