    <h2>Transport Accidents in Spain</h2>
<p>Spain has experienced a second serious rail accident in just a few days. On January 21, a crash involving trains in Andalusia injured at least 37 people, five of them seriously. This follows a deadly collision on Sunday that killed a train driver. These incidents raise concerns about rail safety in the region and may prompt further investigations and safety reviews.</p>
<h2>Fire at Pakistani Shopping Centre</h2>
<p>A fire broke out at a busy shopping mall in Pakistan, causing panic and distress among shoppers. Eyewitnesses described locked exits and frantic calls for help as people tried to escape the blaze. Details about casualties or the cause of the fire have not been disclosed. The incident highlights ongoing safety challenges in crowded commercial spaces.</p>
<h2>Life Sentence for Assassin of Japan’s Ex-PM</h2>
<p>A man has been sentenced to life in prison for assassinating former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. This crime shocked Japan, a country known for its very low rates of gun violence. The sentence concludes the legal process for this landmark case and could influence security measures for public figures in Japan.</p>
<h2>US-EU Trade Tensions Affect Markets</h2>
<p>Global financial markets are on edge due to rising tensions between the United States and the European Union. Europe announced it will suspend approval of a US trade deal amid disputes linked to former US President Donald Trump’s attempts to acquire Greenland. This development may stall trade negotiations and affect economic relations between the two regions.</p>
<h2>Health Concerns for Ugandan Opposition Figure</h2>
<p>Kizza Besigye, a detained veteran Ugandan opposition member, is reported by his party to be critically ill in hospital. However, Ugandan authorities maintain he was admitted for a routine check-up. This conflicting information draws attention to the treatment and conditions of political detainees in Uganda, with potential human rights implications.</p>
<h2>Cultural Spotlight: Film About Palestinian Girl</h2>
<p>Kaouther Ben Hani’s film, *The Voice of Hind Rajab*, tells the story of a Palestinian girl killed in Gaza. The director says creating the film was a way to cope with feelings of helplessness. The work is shortlisted for an Oscar, bringing attention to personal stories from conflict zones through cinema.</p>
