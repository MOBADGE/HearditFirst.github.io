    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 21, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Israel has agreed to join a new organisation called the Board of Peace, established by Donald Trump. Israel is the latest country to accept an invitation, following Albania, Bahrain, Hungary, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates. This move continues to build a coalition around Trump's peace initiative, though details on its objectives and impact remain to be seen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, renewed tensions between the United States and the European Union have led Europe to suspend approval of a US trade deal. This decision comes as Trump pushes for the controversial acquisition of Greenland. Some Republicans in the US Congress oppose Trump on this issue, but it is unclear if they will join Democrats to block the proposed takeover of the island.</p>
<h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>Authorities in Nigeria have confirmed mass abductions from three churches in Kaduna state, with more than 160 people reportedly taken. Initial denials have been replaced by official recognition of the kidnappings, raising concerns about security in the region.</p>
<p>In Uganda, opposition figure Kizza Besigye remains critically ill in hospital, according to his political party. Officials have described his hospital visit as a routine check-up, but supporters express serious worries about his health amid his detention.</p>
<h2>Japan: Nuclear Energy and Justice</h2>
<p>Japan has restarted a reactor at the world’s largest nuclear power plant, nearly 15 years after the Fukushima disaster. This marks a significant development in the country’s energy policy as it balances public concerns about nuclear safety with power needs.</p>
<p>In a separate legal development, a man convicted of assassinating former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been sentenced to life in prison. Abe's death had a profound impact on Japan, where gun crime is extremely rare.</p>
<h2>Transportation Incidents</h2>
<p>Spain has suffered a second serious rail crash within days. The latest accident involved a collision resulting in the death of a train driver and injuries to at least 37 people, five of whom remain in serious condition. This follows a previous two-train collision in Andalusia, raising questions about rail safety.</p>
<p>In India, campaigners have highlighted safety concerns regarding an Air India aircraft that crashed recently. They claim the plane had a record of technical failures, including a previous fire, adding scrutiny to aviation safety standards.</p>
<h2>Human Rights in Iran</h2>
<p>Leaked photographs obtained by the BBC have revealed the faces of hundreds killed during a crackdown on protests in Iran. The images were shown to families identifying their loved ones at a mortuary in Tehran, shedding light on the human cost of the government's response to dissent.</p>
