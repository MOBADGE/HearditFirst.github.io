<h2>Verdict in Assassination of Shinzo Abe</h2>
<p>A man accused of killing Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe has been sentenced to life imprisonment. The assassination shocked Japan, a country known for very low rates of gun crime. The life sentence reflects the judicial response to such a rare and violent event, and the case remains significant for discussions around political security in Japan.</p>
<h2>Tensions in US–EU Trade Relations</h2>
<p>European authorities plan to suspend approval of a US trade deal amid rising tensions with the United States.

<h2>Food Racism Case at US University</h2>
<p>An Indian couple received a $200,000 settlement after experiencing what they described as "food racism" at a US university.

The case highlights issues of cultural sensitivity and discrimination related to food practices in diverse settings.</p>
<h2>Introduction of Kei Cars to the US Market</h2>
