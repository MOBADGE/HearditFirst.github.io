    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 09, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Former U.S. leader Donald Trump has criticized European countries, calling them "decaying" and their leaders "weak" for failing to control migration and taking insufficient action to end the war in Ukraine. This comment drew a response from the UK, which highlighted Europe’s "strength" in dealing with these challenges. Meanwhile, Lithuania has declared a state of emergency due to what it calls a "hybrid attack" involving balloons from Belarus, raising concerns about national security and civil aviation.</p>
<h2>Americas</h2>
<p>Venezuela’s opposition leader María Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, remains in hiding with her current location unknown. This uncertainty has led to questions about when she will be able to attend the award ceremony. Her situation highlights the ongoing political tensions within Venezuela.</p>
<h2>United States: Government Oversight</h2>
<p>U.S. lawmakers are increasing pressure to release unedited video footage related to a controversial incident involving a boat strike. Congress is threatening to withhold Pentagon travel funds as leverage to obtain the full video. This move reflects ongoing efforts by lawmakers to hold authorities accountable and ensure transparency in military-related matters.</p>
<h2>Europe: Politics and Society</h2>
<p>In France, Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu survived a tight vote in parliament to pass the 2026 budget bill, despite divisions within the government. This outcome will influence France’s public spending and economic policies for the coming year. Additionally, French feminists have expressed anger over comments made by Brigitte Macron, the country’s first lady, about activists who interrupted a comedian’s show. The backlash indicates ongoing societal debates over activism and free expression.</p>
<h2>Legal and Technology Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, a judge has ruled to unseal grand jury records related to Ghislaine Maxwell, citing a new law requiring the release of files connected to Jeffrey Epstein. This development could shed further light on investigations into their cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Union is investigating Google regarding its use of AI-generated summaries in search results. The EU is examining whether Google has failed to offer appropriate compensation to web publishers whose content is summarized, a case that could impact how digital content is shared and monetized in the future.</p>
<h2>Business and Leadership Changes</h2>
<p>In the Czech Republic, a billionaire businessman has taken office as prime minister. He has pledged to sever financial ties to his business empire, Agrofert, which spans various sectors from food products to fertilizer. If he follows through, this would constitute a significant change in business ethics and governance at the national level.</p>
