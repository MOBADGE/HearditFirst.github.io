    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukrainian forces continue to resist Russia's advance in the city of Pokrovsk, despite having only limited control there. They recently raised the Ukrainian flag to demonstrate their ongoing fight. Meanwhile, Kyiv is preparing a new peace plan amid pressure from the US to negotiate a deal that would involve ceding territory to Russia. Ukrainian leadership has firmly rejected giving up any land, signaling a continued commitment to retake and hold their territory.</p>
<h2>Southeast Asia Border Dispute</h2>
<p>Thailand and Cambodia are involved in a border conflict rooted in a dispute that dates back more than a century. The two neighbouring countries have tensions along their shared boundary, reflecting a long-standing historical grievance. The situation remains tense, highlighting the challenges of resolving deeply entrenched territorial disagreements.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Emergencies</h2>
<p>A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck northern Japan, injuring dozens of people. Authorities have warned that there is a possibility of stronger tremors in the coming days, urging caution and preparedness among residents and emergency services. In Sudan, a recent report has documented the military’s air force campaign that has bombed towns, markets, and schools, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths, underscoring the severe humanitarian impact of ongoing conflicts there.</p>
<h2>Environmental Policy and Controversy</h2>
<p>A prominent scientist involved in a recent UN environmental report has accused the United States and other governments of derailing agreement on the study’s findings, particularly concerning fossil fuel usage. This development has complicated international efforts to address environmental challenges and reach consensus on global climate initiatives.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Zohran Mamdani, who will serve as mayor of New York City, confirmed he plans to live in the historic Gracie Mansion. It remains unclear whether he will keep his rent-stabilized apartment in Queens. In India, police report that the owners of a Goa nightclub fled to Thailand shortly after a deadly fire occurred at their establishment. The two brothers boarded a flight to Phuket hours following the incident, and investigations continue.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Aid</h2>
<p>In the United States, Trump announced a $12 billion aid package targeting farmers who have been affected by what he described as "unjustified trade actions." He also threatened to impose an additional 5% tariff on Mexico over a dispute involving water supplies that impact US agriculture. Additionally, the US deported a second group of more than 50 Iranian nationals from Mesa, Arizona, as part of ongoing immigration enforcement efforts.</p>
