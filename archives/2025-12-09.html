    <h2>Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukrainian forces continue to resist in the city of Pokrovsk, which lies in an area claimed by Russia. While Ukraine holds only a small part of the city, troops raised the Ukrainian flag to show their determination to keep fighting. At the same time, Kyiv is preparing a new peace plan but firmly rejects giving up any territory to Russia, opposing a proposal supported by the US that might involve handing land over. The ongoing conflict remains tense with no clear resolution in sight, as Ukraine aims to safeguard its borders.</p>
<h2>International Tensions in Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Tensions have escalated between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute with historical roots stretching back more than a century. The latest incidents underscore the long-standing nature of this disagreement, which continues to affect relations between the two neighboring countries. Officials and observers are watching closely as both sides navigate this complex and sensitive issue.</p>
<h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>A group of US lawmakers is pressing for the release of unedited video footage related to a controversial boat strike incident. They have threatened to withhold Pentagon travel funds until the footage is made public. This move reflects growing calls for transparency and accountability in government actions, highlighting tensions between lawmakers and the Department of Defense. Separately, former FBI agents have filed lawsuits claiming they were punished for publicly taking a knee—a gesture associated with protest—during a 2020 demonstration. The agents argue that their action helped to reduce tensions at the event.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Technological Issues</h2>
<p>The European Union is investigating Google over its use of AI-generated summaries in search results. The inquiry focuses on whether Google failed to provide appropriate compensation to web publishers whose content is summarized. This comes amid broader concerns over how large technology companies share value with content creators. In a related global development, a top scientist has criticized governments, including the US, for derailing an international agreement intended to strengthen a UN environment report. The disagreement centered on fossil fuel policies, highlighting deep divisions in efforts to address climate change.</p>
<h2>Natural Disaster in Japan</h2>
<p>Northern Japan was hit by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, injuring dozens of people. Local authorities have issued warnings that stronger tremors could follow in the coming days, urging residents to remain alert and prepared. Emergency services are actively responding to the situation, emphasizing the need for ongoing caution in the affected areas.</p>
