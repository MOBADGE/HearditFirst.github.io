    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 09, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has criticized several European countries, describing them as "decaying" and their leaders as "weak." He pointed to what he sees as their failure to control migration and to take effective steps toward ending the war in Ukraine. In response, UK officials have publicly praised Europe's "strength," highlighting a contrast in views on the continent's current state and leadership amid ongoing challenges.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, Lithuania has declared a state of emergency in reaction to what its Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene called a "hybrid attack" involving balloons allegedly launched from Belarus. The government expressed serious concerns about threats to national security and civil aviation, underlining rising tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Political Developments and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado remains in hiding, with her current location unknown. This casts uncertainty over her ability to attend the upcoming Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, raising questions about the political situation and safety concerns for opposition figures in the country.</p>
<p>A significant legal development occurred in the United States as a judge ruled that grand jury records related to Ghislaine Maxwell can be unsealed. The decision is based on a recent law mandating transparency of files connected to Jeffrey Epstein. This could shed light on previously confidential aspects of the case and its broader implications.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in France, Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has narrowly won a vote on the 2026 budget bill despite a divided parliament. The outcome allows the government to move forward with its fiscal plans amid a challenging political environment.</p>
<p>In the Czech Republic, a billionaire businessman has become Prime Minister with a promise to sever financial ties to his extensive business empire, Agrofert. If he follows through, he would no longer profit from any products, ranging from food items to fertilisers, signaling an attempt to address concerns about conflicts of interest.</p>
<h2>Technology and Regulation</h2>
<p>The European Union is investigating Google over its use of AI-generated summaries in search results. The inquiry focuses on whether Google has provided "appropriate compensation" to web publishers for their content. This reflects ongoing scrutiny over the balance between innovation in technology and protection of content creators' rights.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Public Reaction</h2>
<p>In France, a comment by First Lady Brigitte Macron referring to feminist activists who interrupted a comedian’s show has sparked significant controversy. Many feminists have reacted strongly against the terminology she used, highlighting tensions within public discourse on activism and gender issues.</p>
<h2>US Congressional Oversight</h2>
<p>In the United States, Congress is increasing pressure on the Pentagon to release an unedited video of a controversial incident involving a boat strike. Lawmakers have threatened to withhold travel funds from a Pentagon official until the full footage is made public. This reflects ongoing demands for transparency and accountability in military-related incidents.</p>
<h2>Crime and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Prosecutors released bodycam footage showing the first interaction between police officers and Luigi Mangione, a suspect in a high-profile murder case involving the death of a CEO. This footage provides new insights into the initial police response and is part of the wider investigation into the matter.</p>
