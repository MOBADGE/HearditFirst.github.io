    <h2>Global Politics and Conflict</h2>
<p>The US president criticized several European countries for what he called their failure to manage migration and lack of decisive action to end the war in Ukraine. This highlights ongoing tensions over Europe's response to the conflict and migration challenges. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces continue to resist Russia's advance in Pokrovsk, a city claimed by Russia, signaling the persistence of fighting despite territorial losses.</p>
<h2>Security and Military Issues</h2>
<p>In Sudan, a report has documented how the air force's bombing campaign on towns, markets, and schools has resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths. This raises serious concerns about the humanitarian impact of the military actions in the region. Additionally, Lithuania has declared an emergency situation, citing national security and civil aviation risks from balloons launched by Belarus, describing the incident as a "hybrid attack."</p>
<h2>US Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>US lawmakers are increasing pressure on the Pentagon to release an unedited video related to a controversial boat strike. They are threatening to withhold travel funds allocated to the Pentagon until the video is made public. Separately, a group of former FBI agents are suing the agency, claiming they were punished for taking the knee—a gesture linked to 2020 protests intended to reduce tensions during demonstrations.</p>
<h2>Technology and Regulation</h2>
<p>The European Union has launched an investigation into Google over its use of AI-generated summaries in search results. The inquiry focuses on whether Google has failed to provide proper compensation to web publishers for their content, reflecting ongoing regulatory scrutiny of tech companies and AI practices in Europe.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Public Response</h2>
<p>In France, the first lady's remarks describing feminist activists who interrupted a comedian's show have sparked significant backlash from feminist groups. The controversy highlights ongoing debates about activism and public discourse in the country.</p>
