    <h2>Global Politics and Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukraine is preparing a new peace plan in ongoing efforts to resolve its conflict with Russia. Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have ruled out any peace deal that would involve handing over Ukrainian territory to Russia. This comes amid pressure from the United States for a resolution that might include territorial concessions. The situation remains tense, with Ukraine focused on maintaining its sovereignty while seeking international support.</p>
<p>In Sudan, a recent report has detailed the impact of the Sudanese air force’s bombing campaign on towns, markets, and schools. The study highlights how civilians have been severely affected, with hundreds reported dead as a result of the aerial attacks. This underscores the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the challenges faced by civilians caught in the conflict.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>Northern Japan experienced a powerful earthquake measuring magnitude 7.5. Dozens of people were injured in the tremor, and authorities have issued warnings about the potential for an even stronger aftershock in the coming days. Emergency services and local governments are on high alert as they continue to assess damage and support affected communities.</p>
<h2>U.S. Domestic News and Policy</h2>
<p>In the United States, a group of more than 50 Iranian nationals was deported from Mesa, Arizona. This marks the second such deportation of Iranians by U.S. officials, as part of immigration enforcement activities. Details about the broader context or reasons for the deportations were not specified.</p>
<p>Separately, former U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a $12 billion aid package aimed at supporting American farmers. The package is designed to assist those affected by what he described as "unjustified trade actions." At the same time, he threatened to impose an additional 5% tariff on Mexico, related to disputes about water supplies for U.S. farmers, highlighting ongoing trade tensions between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Social Programs and Innovation</h2>
<p>India has launched one of the world’s largest programs to financially support women through unconditional cash transfers. Approximately 118 million women in 12 states are receiving payments as part of an experiment to give a wage for housework and empower women economically. The initiative aims to recognize unpaid labor traditionally performed by women and could influence social policy on gender and economic rights.</p>
<h2>Space and Exploration</h2>
<p>After spending 245 days aboard the International Space Station, NASA astronaut Jonny Kim and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky have begun their journey back to Earth. Their spacecraft is expected to land safely in Kazakhstan. This marks the end of a long mission contributing to scientific research and international collaboration in space exploration.</p>
