    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>Ukraine is preparing a new peace plan amid ongoing tensions with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made clear that the country will not concede any territory to Russia, pushing back against a U.S. proposal for a deal that would involve territorial concessions. Kyiv’s resistance reflects the broader struggle over sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the outcome of these talks could significantly influence the course of the conflict and regional stability.</p>
<h2>Natural Disaster in Japan</h2>
<p>A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck northern Japan, causing injuries to dozens of people and raising concern among authorities about the potential for stronger tremors in the coming days. Emergency services continue to assess the impact and prepare for possible aftershocks. The event underscores the seismic risks facing the region and the need for ongoing preparedness and response measures.</p>
<h2>Sudan Air Campaign and Civilian Impact</h2>
<p>A recent report has revealed that Sudan’s air force bombing of towns, markets, and schools has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians. The study provides detailed insight into the military’s aerial campaign and its severe consequences for non-combatants, highlighting the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region. The findings call attention to the urgent need for protection of civilians in conflict zones.</p>
<h2>New York Mayoral Residence Decision</h2>
<p>Zohran Mamdani, who recently became the mayor of New York, has confirmed that he will live in the historic Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence. It remains unclear whether he will keep his rent-stabilised apartment in Queens. This move signals a traditional step for the mayor’s office and may affect his connection to different parts of the city.</p>
<h2>U.S. Farm Aid Package and Trade Disputes</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package intended to support farmers affected by what he described as "unjustified trade actions." Alongside this, he threatened to impose an additional 5% tariff on Mexico amid a dispute over water supplies for U.S. farmers. These developments highlight ongoing trade tensions and their impact on the agriculture sector.</p>
<h2>Space Crew Return to Earth</h2>
<p>NASA astronaut Jonny Kim, joined by Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky, has begun their journey back to Earth after spending 245 days aboard the International Space Station. The crew is expected to land safely in Kazakhstan, marking the end of a long-duration mission and continuing international cooperation in space exploration.</p>
