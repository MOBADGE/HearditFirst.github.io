    <div class="date">December 09, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump criticised several European countries for what he described as "decaying" conditions and "weak" leadership. He highlighted failures in controlling migration and in efforts to end the war in Ukraine. In response, the UK praised what it called Europe's "strength" amid these ongoing challenges. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado remains in hiding, with her current location unknown, raising questions about her participation in the upcoming Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for which she is a laureate.</p>
<h2>Security and National Emergencies</h2>
<p>Lithuania has declared an emergency in response to an ongoing "hybrid attack" involving balloons from neighbouring Belarus. Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene warned that this situation poses significant risks to national security and civil aviation. In Sudan, a new report has revealed that military air force bombings of towns, markets, and schools have resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths. The study underlines the severe humanitarian impact of the conflict and the targeting of non-combatants.</p>
<h2>Legal and Government Accountability</h2>
<p>In the United States, Congress is applying pressure on the Pentagon by threatening to withhold travel funds for a Pentagon official, Pete Hegseth, until an unedited video of a controversial boat strike incident is released publicly. Additionally, a group of former FBI agents who were dismissed are suing the agency. They claim their termination was related to their decision to "take the knee" during a 2020 protest, a gesture they say helped ease tensions at the time.</p>
<h2>Technology and Regulation</h2>
<p>The European Union has launched an investigation into Google concerning its use of AI-generated summaries in search results. The EU is examining whether Google failed to provide "appropriate compensation" to web publishers whose content is summarised by artificial intelligence technology. This inquiry reflects broader concerns around fair use and monetisation of online content amid rapid advances in AI.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Issues</h2>
<p>In France, feminist groups have expressed outrage over comments made by the country's first lady, Brigitte Macron, who used a term to describe activists who interrupted a comedian's show. The backlash highlights ongoing tensions between public figures and social activists in France over issues related to protest and expression.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>A tragic fire broke out in an office building in Jakarta, Indonesia, resulting in the deaths of at least 22 people. The blaze began during the lunch break when many workers were likely present, making it a deadly accident and raising concerns about workplace safety standards in the capital.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This summary brings together key headlines from around the world today, spanning politics, security, technology, social issues, and public safety. Each situation carries implications for governance, human rights, and public trust moving forward.</p>
