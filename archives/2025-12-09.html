    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 09, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump criticized several European countries, calling them "decaying" with "weak" leaders. He specifically accused these nations of failing to control migration and not taking sufficient action to end the war in Ukraine. In response, the UK defended Europe's overall strength, presenting a contrasting view to Trump's comments.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, Lithuania has declared an emergency situation over balloons linked to Belarus, describing the events as a "hybrid attack." Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene warned that these actions pose significant risks to both national security and civil aviation in Lithuania.</p>
<h2>Europe’s Political Developments</h2>
<p>In France, Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu survived a key parliamentary vote on the country’s 2026 budget bill. The vote was narrow, highlighting divisions within the French parliament, but the budget was ultimately approved, allowing government spending plans to move forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Czech Republic, a billionaire businessman has become prime minister. He has pledged to separate himself from his business empire, Agrofert, which includes products ranging from food items like frankfurters to fertilisers. If he follows through, it would mark a significant step in addressing concerns about conflicts of interest.</p>
<h2>Legal and Judicial News</h2>
<p>A judge has ordered that grand jury records related to Ghislaine Maxwell can be publicly released. Judge Paul Engelmayer referenced a new law passed last month, which requires files associated with Jeffrey Epstein to be made available. This decision may lead to increased public insight into the high-profile case.</p>
<h2>Media and Technology</h2>
<p>The European Union is investigating Google regarding the use of AI-generated summaries in its search results. The investigation is focused on whether Google appropriately compensated web publishers for the content used in creating these summaries. This inquiry could impact how tech companies license and use content across the internet.</p>
<h2>Security and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>US Congress is applying pressure to release an unedited video of a controversial boat strike incident. Some lawmakers are threatening to withhold Pentagon travel funds linked to Fox News personality Pete Hegseth until the full video is made public, underlining the demand for transparency in military-related events.</p>
<p>In New York, prosecutors have released bodycam footage of police confronting Luigi Mangione, a suspect in the killing of a CEO. The footage shows the initial interaction between officers and Mangione at a McDonald's, contributing to public understanding of the police response in this case.</p>
<h2>Social Issues</h2>
<p>In France, first lady Brigitte Macron has drawn criticism from feminist groups after her comment describing activists who interrupted a comedian's show. The backlash centers on the terminology she used, which some found objectionable. This incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding activist movements and public discourse in France.</p>
<h2>International Peace and Security</h2>
<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, named a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, remains in hiding with her current location unknown. This uncertainty has raised questions about her ability to attend the upcoming award ceremony, underscoring the unstable political situation in Venezuela.</p>
