    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>US President has criticised European countries, calling them "decaying" and their leaders "weak." He argues that Europe has not effectively managed migration issues or taken decisive steps to end the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. This reflects continuing tensions and differing views on handling the conflict and its related challenges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fighting continues in Ukraine as Ukrainian forces maintain a presence in the city of Pokrovsk, which Russia claims. Despite limited control, Ukrainian troops are eager to demonstrate their ongoing resistance against Russia's advance.</p>
<h2>Security and Military Developments</h2>
<p>In Lithuania, a state of emergency has been declared following concerns about balloons from Belarus. The prime minister described these as a "hybrid attack," warning that they pose serious risks to national security and civil aviation. This raises tensions in the region and highlights ongoing security concerns related to Belarus.</p>
<p>In Sudan, a report reveals that air force bombings targeting towns, markets, and schools have led to hundreds of civilian deaths. The study draws attention to the devastating impact of aerial military actions on non-combatants amid conflict.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Issues</h2>
<p>US lawmakers are increasing pressure on the Pentagon over a controversial boat strike video. Congress is considering withholding Pentagon travel funds until an unedited version of the incident video is publicly released, underlining demands for transparency in military operations.</p>
<p>Additionally, a group of former FBI agents have filed a lawsuit claiming they were dismissed for taking the knee during a 2020 demonstration. They state that this gesture helped calm tensions at the protest, raising questions about workplace freedom and rights.</p>
<h2>European Social and Legal Matters</h2>
<p>In France, there has been public backlash against comments made by Brigitte Macron, the first lady, regarding feminist activists. Her description of activists who disrupted a comedian's show has sparked outrage among feminist groups, illustrating divisions on protest and activism within French society.</p>
<p>Separately, the European Union has launched an investigation into Google. The focus is on whether the company failed to provide fair compensation to web publishers for AI-generated summaries included in its search results, signalling ongoing scrutiny of big tech and digital rights in Europe.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>A UN environment report aimed at addressing global environmental issues has faced obstruction. According to a leading scientist involved in the study, the United States and other governments sidetracked efforts to reach an agreement, particularly on fossil fuel policies. This development highlights difficulties in international cooperation to tackle environmental challenges.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Emergencies</h2>
<p>In Jakarta, at least 22 people have died in an office fire that broke out during lunchtime. Authorities confirmed the tragic incident as rescue efforts continue, underscoring concerns about fire safety in urban workplaces.</p>
