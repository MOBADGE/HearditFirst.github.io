    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 09, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump criticized several European countries, describing them as "decaying" with "weak" leaders. He claimed these countries have failed to effectively control migration and have not taken sufficient action to end the war in Ukraine. In response, the UK praised Europe's "strength," signaling a differing view on the continent’s resilience and political will.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado remains in hiding, and her exact location is currently unknown. This has raised concerns as she is the latest Nobel Peace Prize winner still absent from the ceremony amid unstable conditions in her country.</p>
<h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>US Congress is putting pressure on the Pentagon to release an unedited video related to a controversial boat strike incident. Lawmakers have threatened to withhold Pentagon travel funds until the full video is made public, emphasizing calls for transparency in military affairs.</p>
<p>Additionally, a group of former FBI agents are suing the agency, alleging they were punished for participating in the protest gesture known as "taking the knee." The agents contend their actions helped defuse tensions during a 2020 demonstration, highlighting ongoing debates about protest and expression within federal institutions.</p>
<h2>European and Regional Issues</h2>
<p>In France, there is backlash against a comment made by the country's first lady, Brigitte Macron, who described feminist activists who interrupted a comedian’s show with a term that sparked outrage. This incident underscores ongoing tensions around gender activism and public discourse in France.</p>
<p>Lithuania has declared a state of emergency over concerns about "hybrid attacks" involving balloons arriving from neighboring Belarus. Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene warned that these incidents pose significant risks to national security and civil aviation, reflecting rising regional security tensions.</p>
<h2>Technology and Environment</h2>
<p>The European Union is investigating Google over the use of AI-generated summaries in its search results. The inquiry focuses on whether Google has failed to offer appropriate compensation to web publishers, amid broader concerns about the impacts of AI on the media and content industries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a report co-chaired by a top scientist claims that the United States and other governments disrupted consensus on a UN global environment study. The co-chair said these countries "hijacked" the report, particularly concerning fossil fuel issues, illustrating challenges in achieving international environmental cooperation.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>A new investigation has revealed that Sudan's air force bombing of towns, markets, and schools has resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths. The detailed study sheds light on the scale of the military’s aerial campaign and its impact on non-combatants, raising alarms about the humanitarian situation.</p>
<p>In Jakarta, Indonesia, a fire at an office building during lunch break has tragically killed at least 22 people. Emergency responders continue to address the aftermath as officials investigate the cause of the blaze, which occurred in the nation’s capital.</p>
