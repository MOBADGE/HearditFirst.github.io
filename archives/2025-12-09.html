    <h2>Conflict and Diplomacy in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukraine is preparing a new peace plan amid ongoing tensions with Russia. Ukrainian officials, including President Zelensky, have firmly rejected any deal that would involve handing over Ukrainian territory to Russia. This stance comes as the United States pushes for a resolution that might include territorial concessions. Ukraine’s position suggests that peace efforts will continue to be complex, with significant challenges ahead in negotiations.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters in Japan</h2>
<p>A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck northern Japan, causing injuries to dozens of people. Authorities have issued warnings that a stronger tremor may be possible in the coming days, urging residents to stay alert and prepared. Emergency response efforts are underway, focusing on ensuring the safety of those affected.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns in Sudan</h2>
<p>A new report detailed an air campaign by Sudan’s air force that has bombed towns, markets, and schools, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths. The study highlights the severe impact of aerial attacks on non-combatants and raises concerns about the protection of civilians in the ongoing conflict. The findings may influence international responses and calls for accountability.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in New York City</h2>
<p>Zohran Mamdani has confirmed he will live in Gracie Mansion after being elected mayor of New York City. Gracie Mansion is the traditional residence for New York’s mayor, marking a visible step in his new role. It remains unclear whether Mamdani will continue to maintain his rent-stabilized apartment in Queens, where he previously lived.</p>
<h2>Social and Economic Policies in India</h2>
<p>India is undertaking one of the world’s largest experiments by providing unconditional cash transfers to about 118 million women across 12 states. This initiative is aimed at compensating women for housework, recognizing unpaid labor as economically valuable. The program reflects India’s efforts to address gender equity and support women financially on a large scale.</p>
<h2>Space Mission Update</h2>
<p>NASA astronaut Jonny Kim, along with Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky, has begun their return to Earth after spending 245 days aboard the International Space Station. Their planned touchdown will be in Kazakhstan, concluding a long-duration mission that contributed to scientific research and international cooperation in space.</p>
