    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 09, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump criticised several European countries for what he described as "decaying" conditions and "weak" leadership. He specifically accused these nations of failing to control migration and neglecting efforts to end the war in Ukraine. In response, the UK emphasised Europe's resilience and strength amid these challenges.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado remains in hiding, and her location is currently unknown. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year, but officials are uncertain when or if she will be able to attend the ceremony.</p>
<p>In Lithuania, Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene declared a state of emergency following what she called a "hybrid attack" involving balloons from neighbouring Belarus. The Lithuanian government views this threat as a significant risk to national security and civil aviation.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>A report has detailed air force bombings by the Sudanese military targeting towns, markets, and schools. The study indicates that hundreds of civilians have been killed as a result of this aerial campaign, underscoring the severe human impact of ongoing conflict in Sudan.</p>
<h2>United States Politics and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>US lawmakers are increasing pressure on the Pentagon to release an unedited video related to a controversial boat strike incident. Congress is considering withholding Pentagon travel funds as a means to compel transparency.</p>
<p>Separately, a group of former FBI agents has filed a lawsuit claiming they were dismissed as punishment for taking a knee—a gesture used during protests to defuse tensions at a 2020 demonstration. The agents argue that their actions were intended to promote peace rather than dissent.</p>
<h2>Europe and Technology</h2>
<p>The European Union has launched an investigation into Google concerning AI-generated summaries shown in search results. The focus is on whether Google has failed to provide appropriate compensation to web publishers whose content is used in creating these summaries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in France, Brigitte Macron, the country's first lady, faced backlash from feminist groups after comments she made about activists who interrupted a comedian's show. The activists and their supporters objected strongly to the terminology she used to describe them.</p>
<h2>Business and Leadership</h2>
<p>In the Czech Republic, a billionaire businessman has become Prime Minister with a commitment to sever financial ties with his extensive business empire, Agrofert. If he follows through on his promise, he will no longer benefit financially from the company's products, which range from food items like frankfurters to fertilisers.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Accidents</h2>
<p>In Jakarta, Indonesia, a fire in an office building during lunchtime killed at least 22 people, according to police reports. Emergency services responded to the blaze in the capital city, but many workers were unable to evacuate in time.</p>
