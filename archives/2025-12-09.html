    <h2>Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukrainian forces continue to resist despite losing much ground in the city of Pokrovsk, which Russia claims to control. Ukrainian troops raised their flag in the city to demonstrate ongoing efforts to push back Russian advances. Meanwhile, Kyiv is working on a new peace plan that rejects suggestions from the United States to cede territory to Russia. Ukrainian leadership remains firm on not giving up any land, signaling that negotiations may face significant challenges ahead.</p>
<h2>International Tensions and Investigations</h2>
<p>In the United States, Congress is applying pressure to the Pentagon to release unedited video footage of a controversial boat strike incident. Lawmakers have threatened to withhold Pentagon officials’ travel funds until the full video is made public, reflecting growing demands for transparency. In Europe, the European Union has launched an investigation into Google’s use of AI-generated summaries in search results. The probe concerns whether Google has adequately compensated web publishers whose content is being summarized by AI technology.</p>
<h2>Regional Conflicts and Crises</h2>
<p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have flared over longstanding border disputes dating back more than a century. The conflict underscores historical grievances between neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. In Sudan, a recent report details widespread aerial bombings by the Sudanese air force hitting towns, markets, and schools. The military campaign has caused hundreds of civilian deaths, drawing attention to the humanitarian impact of the conflict.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Emergencies</h2>
<p>A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck northern Japan, injuring dozens of people. Authorities have warned residents to be prepared for the possibility of a stronger aftershock in the coming days. In Indonesia, a fire broke out in an office building in Jakarta during lunch hours, killing at least 22 people. Emergency responders are investigating the cause of the blaze as the city mourns the loss.</p>
<h2>Social Unrest</h2>
<p>In Tanzania, authorities have imposed a large security presence and encouraged people to stay home amid a crackdown on planned protests. The streets of major cities were deserted as police moved to prevent demonstrations, reflecting growing tensions between citizens and the government.</p>
