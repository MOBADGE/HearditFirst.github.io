    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 09, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump criticized several European countries, calling them "decaying" and their leaders "weak." He argued that these nations have failed to control migration and take effective steps to end the war in Ukraine. In contrast, the UK responded by praising Europe's strength, highlighting differing views on the continent's political and security situation.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado remains in hiding, with her current location unknown. This uncertainty has raised questions as she is the winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, and officials are unsure when she will be able to attend the award ceremony.</p>
<p>In the Czech Republic, a billionaire businessman has become prime minister, pledging to cut ties to his extensive business empire, Agrofert. If he follows through, he will no longer profit from any products associated with the company, which ranges from food items like frankfurters to fertilisers. This move is seen as an attempt to reduce conflicts of interest between his business interests and political role.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Lithuania has declared a state of emergency due to concerns over what it describes as a "hybrid attack" involving balloons launched from Belarus. The Lithuanian prime minister, Inga Ruginiene, warned that these incidents pose a significant risk to national security and civil aviation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a report has detailed the Sudanese air force's aerial bombings of towns, markets, and schools, which have resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths. This study sheds light on the humanitarian impact of Sudan's ongoing conflict and the use of air power against populated areas.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Issues</h2>
<p>In the United States, lawmakers are increasing pressure on the Pentagon to release an unedited video of a controversial boat strike incident. As a measure of accountability, members of Congress have threatened to withhold travel funding from the Department of Defense if the full video is not made public.</p>
<p>Separately, a group of former FBI agents has filed a lawsuit claiming they were punished for taking the knee during a 2020 demonstration. The agents assert that the gesture, adopted from protest movements, helped defuse tensions at the event, and that their firing reflects unjust treatment.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media</h2>
<p>The European Union has launched an investigation into Google regarding its use of artificial intelligence to generate summaries in its search results. The inquiry focuses on whether Google has failed to provide "appropriate compensation" to web publishers whose content is being used to create these AI-generated summaries. This could have implications for how tech companies manage digital content and share revenue.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural News</h2>
<p>In France, Brigitte Macron, the country's first lady, faced backlash after comments she made describing activists who disrupted a comedian’s show. Feminist groups expressed outrage over the term she used for the protesters, highlighting ongoing tensions around activism and public discourse in France.</p>
<h2>Tragedies</h2>
<p>In Jakarta, a fire at an office building during lunch break has killed at least 22 people. The blaze struck in the Indonesian capital, causing significant loss of life and raising concerns about workplace safety measures.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories reflect a range of ongoing political, security, social, and technological issues around the world, with developments likely to continue evolving in the coming days and weeks.</p>
