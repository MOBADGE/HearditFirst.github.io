    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 09, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has criticized several European countries, describing them as "decaying" and their leaders as "weak." He argued that these countries are failing to effectively manage migration issues and are not taking sufficient action to end the war in Ukraine. In response, the UK government emphasized Europe's ongoing strength. Meanwhile, Lithuania has declared a state of emergency due to what Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene described as a "hybrid attack" involving balloons coming from Belarus, posing risks to national security and civil aviation.</p>
<h2>Latin America: Peace Prize Winner’s Whereabouts Unknown</h2>
<p>María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, is currently in hiding. Norwegian Nobel officials have said they are uncertain when she will be able to attend the award ceremony. Her situation highlights ongoing tensions in Venezuela and raises questions about the opposition’s ability to operate freely.</p>
<h2>US Congressional Pressure on Pentagon</h2>
<p>In the United States, lawmakers are escalating pressure for the release of an unedited video related to a controversial boat strike incident. There is a possibility that Congress may withhold Pentagon travel funds until the full footage is made public. This move reflects growing demands for transparency regarding military actions and accountability.</p>
<h2>France: Political and Social Developments</h2>
<p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu secured a narrow victory in parliament over the 2026 budget, despite a divided assembly. This marks a critical step for the government’s financial plans amid political challenges. Separately, France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, faced backlash after using a term to describe activists who interrupted a comedian’s show. French feminist groups expressed outrage at her comment, interpreting it as dismissive of activist efforts.</p>
<h2>Legal and Technology Updates</h2>
<p>In New York, a judge ruled that grand jury records connected to Ghislaine Maxwell can be unsealed, citing a recently passed law requiring the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. This decision may allow greater public insight into investigations surrounding Epstein’s activities. In the technology sector, the European Union is investigating Google over its use of AI-generated summaries in search results. The EU is examining whether Google failed to provide appropriate compensation to web publishers for their content.</p>
<h2>Crime and Business</h2>
<p>In a notable crime development, prosecutors released bodycam footage showing the moment police confronted Luigi Mangione at a McDonald’s; Mangione is suspected in a CEO’s killing. Meanwhile, in the Czech Republic, a billionaire businessman has become prime minister. He has pledged to sever financial ties to his business empire, Agrofert, which produces a wide range of goods from food products to fertiliser. If he follows through on this promise, it would represent a significant step away from potential conflicts of interest.</p>
