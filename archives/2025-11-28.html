    <h2>Ukraine Political Update</h2>
<p>Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home. Yermak, 54, has served in his role throughout Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine. This development raises questions about internal Ukrainian politics and anti-corruption efforts amid the ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Fire Tragedy</h2>
<p>Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested eight additional individuals linked to a recent deadly fire that claimed at least 128 lives. The blaze, which occurred on Wednesday, has left 89 victims unidentified, while 79 people remain injured. Investigations into the cause and accountability continue as the city mourns this significant loss of life.</p>
<h2>Coup in Guinea-Bissau Questioned</h2>
<p>Several West African political figures, including Senegal’s prime minister and a former Nigerian leader, have criticized the recent military takeover in Guinea-Bissau, describing it as a "sham." They expressed doubts about the legitimacy of the coup, signaling potential tensions and challenges for political stability in the region.</p>
<h2>US Migration and Security Developments</h2>
<p>The US president announced a pause on migration from unspecified "third-world countries," promising to remove individuals considered "not a net asset" to the nation. This reflects a tightening of immigration policies. Meanwhile, Afghan Americans have made a public appeal urging the president not to harden his stance following a shooting in Washington DC allegedly involving an Afghan national. This plea highlights concerns about community relations and national security.</p>
<h2>Middle East Conflict and Human Rights Concerns</h2>
<p>An Israeli military raid in southern Syria resulted in the deaths of 13 people, targeting militants in the village of Beit Jinn. Syria’s foreign ministry condemned the operation as a "war crime," intensifying tensions in the region. Separately, a UN panel reported that Israel operates a "de facto policy of torture," based on harrowing testimonies about conditions in Israeli detention centers. Israel has not responded to the latest report but has previously denied such accusations.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery on Mars</h2>
<p>For the first time, scientists have detected lightning on Mars. Researchers recorded electric crackles over 28 hours during observations spanning two Martian years. This finding contributes to understanding the Martian atmosphere and weather phenomena, marking an important milestone in planetary science.</p>
