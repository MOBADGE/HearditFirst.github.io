    <h2>Major Fire in Hong Kong Tower Blocks</h2>
<p>A large fire broke out on Wednesday in two tower blocks in Hong Kong’s Wang Cheong House, causing dozens of deaths. Firefighters are continuing to search for hundreds of people who remain missing amid the aftermath of the blaze. Video footage verified by BBC shows how rapidly the fire spread through the building. Authorities are still working to understand the full extent of the damage and to ensure safety for residents and responders.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Tensions in Ukraine and Lebanon</h2>
<p>In Moscow, the Russian president reiterated demands for Ukrainian territory ahead of upcoming talks with the United States. He accused Kyiv of wanting to fight "to the last Ukrainian," stating that Russia is “in principle” prepared for a prolonged conflict. Meanwhile, in southern Lebanon a year after a ceasefire, tensions remain high as Israel continues air strikes. These attacks are said to target Hezbollah’s efforts to rebuild following recent conflicts, keeping the region unstable despite the ceasefire.</p>
<h2>Developments in Middle East and US-Afghan Relations</h2>
<p>A Palestinian-US teenager, Mohammed Ibrahim, was released after spending nine months in an Israeli jail. He was arrested during a holiday from Florida for allegedly throwing rocks at Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. In the United States, immigration requests for Afghans have been suspended following a shooting incident in Washington. The suspected shooter, an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021, has raised concerns about security protocols relating to immigration and resettlement.</p>
<h2>Changes in French Military Service Policy</h2>
<p>France is set to introduce a form of military service for young people, 25 years after phasing out compulsory conscription. President Emmanuel Macron framed the move as necessary preparation against possible threats, saying, "The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it." Details on how the new program will be structured are still forthcoming, but this marks a significant shift in France’s approach to national defense.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions and Economic Moves in Latin America</h2>
<p>Venezuela has banned six major airlines following escalating tensions with the United States. The affected carriers stopped flights to the country after the US issued warnings about increased military activity in the region. Separately, Argentina is experiencing an oil and gas boom thanks to fracking in one town, and there is hope that this energy growth could benefit the nation’s economy more broadly in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Pope’s First Foreign Trip Highlights Global Conflict Concerns</h2>
<p>On his first overseas trip, the Pope visited Turkey and warned that the future of humanity is at risk due to ongoing conflicts. He described the current global situation as a "third world war being fought piecemeal," emphasizing the need for greater peace and international cooperation amid widespread violence and geopolitical tensions.</p>
