    <h2>Ukraine Political Shake-up</h2>
<p>Andriy Yermak, who has served as the chief of staff to the Ukrainian president throughout the ongoing conflict with Russia, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home. The investigation into alleged corruption marks a notable development amid Ukraine's broader struggle with wartime governance and reform efforts. Yermak’s departure could influence how Ukraine’s leadership manages both internal accountability and external diplomatic relations moving forward.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Hong Kong and Arrests</h2>
<p>Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested eight more individuals in connection with a major fire that occurred on Wednesday, resulting in at least 128 deaths. Among those victims, 89 bodies remain unidentified, and 79 people are still injured. The fire represents one of Hong Kong’s deadliest incidents in recent years, prompting ongoing investigations and heightened public concern about safety and building regulations.</p>
<h2>Violence in Syria and Regional Reactions</h2>
<p>A recent Israeli raid in southern Syria’s village of Beit Jinn has resulted in the deaths of thirteen people. Israel stated it targeted militant groups, but Syria’s foreign ministry condemned the attack as a "war crime." This operation is reported as the deadliest Israeli raid in the area for several months, potentially escalating tensions between Israel and Syria amid ongoing regional instability.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Israel</h2>
<p>A United Nations panel has accused Israel of operating a "de facto policy of torture" in its detention centers. The panel’s report includes distressing accounts from rights organizations detailing severe conditions faced by detainees. While Israel has not commented on this specific UN report, it has previously denied allegations of torture. This development highlights continuing international scrutiny over human rights practices in the region.</p>
<h2>New Scientific Discovery on Mars</h2>
<p>Scientists have recorded the first-ever detection of lightning on Mars. By analyzing 28 hours of recordings collected during two Martian years, researchers heard electric crackles indicating lightning activity. This finding provides new insight into the planet’s atmospheric phenomena and could influence future studies on Mars’s weather systems and potential habitability.</p>
<h2>Key Legal Decision in Japan</h2>
<p>A court in Tokyo has ruled that the country’s ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional. This ruling goes against a trend seen in other courts around Japan, where there had been optimism for advancing marriage equality. The decision means that, for now, Japan’s legal stance on same-sex marriage remains unchanged, though the topic continues to be a subject of social debate and activism.</p>
