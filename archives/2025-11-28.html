    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">November 28, 2025</div>
    <h2>Ukraine Political Shakeup</h2>
<p>Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukraine’s president during the ongoing conflict with Russia, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home. Yermak, 54, played a key role throughout the full-scale war but stepped down amidst the investigation, highlighting continuing concerns over governance and accountability even as Ukraine faces external military threats. The implications for Ukraine’s internal political dynamics remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>Fatal Fire in Hong Kong and Arrests</h2>
<p>Hong Kong authorities have arrested eight more individuals in connection to a devastating fire that took at least 128 lives. The fire occurred on a Wednesday, leaving 89 bodies unidentified and 79 people injured. The additional arrests underline the seriousness with which officials are treating the tragedy, as investigations continue into the causes and responsibilities linked to the blaze. This event has raised public anxiety about safety standards in densely populated areas.</p>
<h2>International Politics and Conflicts</h2>
<p>Hungary’s leader Viktor Orbán visited Moscow again, meeting with Russia’s president who praised Orbán’s "balanced position on the situation in Ukraine." This move defies some European Union partners amid ongoing tensions related to the war in Ukraine, suggesting divisions within the EU over how to engage with Russia.</p>
<p>In another development tied to international security, Israel conducted a military raid in the village of Beit Jinn in southern Syria, killing thirteen people. Israel said it targeted militants, but the Syrian foreign ministry condemned the operation as a "war crime." The incident marks the deadliest Israeli raid in the region for months and highlights ongoing tensions in Syria.</p>
<p>Additionally, West African political figures are criticizing a recent military coup in Guinea-Bissau as a "sham." Prominent voices, including Senegal’s prime minister and Nigeria’s former leader, expressed skepticism about the legitimacy of the takeover, reflecting ongoing instability and contested political authority in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Human Rights Issues</h2>
<p>Former Honduras president Juan Orlando Hernández, sentenced last year in the United States to 45 years in prison for drug trafficking, is set to be pardoned by former US president Donald Trump. Hernández was convicted for conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and this pardon announcement may further fuel debates on justice and political influence.</p>
<p>A United Nations panel has reported that Israel operates a "de facto policy of torture" in its detention centers. Rights groups have documented harsh conditions faced by detainees. Israel has not responded to the latest claims but has previously denied allegations of torture. This report adds to the ongoing scrutiny of Israel’s human rights record.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Personal Stories</h2>
<p>In an unusual story from the Alpine region, three nuns who say they were removed from their convent against their will and placed in a care home have been allowed to stay in the convent if they leave social media. This unusual condition touches on issues of personal freedom and institutional control.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the daughter of a former president resigned amid allegations she recruited South Africans to fight for Russia in the Ukraine conflict. Her resignation coincided with an account from a South African who had been recruited, sharing the harsh realities of war, which may influence public attitudes toward foreign involvement in conflicts.</p>
<p>Finally, Afghan nationals living in the US made a plea to the American president after a shooting in Washington DC allegedly involving an Afghan national. They urged the president not to tighten immigration or security policies in response, underscoring concerns about the potential impact on their communities.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This round-up reflects political turmoil, international conflict, ongoing investigations into disasters, and human rights controversies shaping global news today.</p>
