    <h2>Deadly Hong Kong Fire Raises Questions</h2>
<p>A massive fire erupted in Hong Kong, engulfing seven tower blocks and becoming the deadliest blaze in the city in decades. The rapid spread of the fire has led to public frustration and demands for accountability, with many questioning how such a disaster could have happened. Families of the missing continue to wait anxiously for news of their loved ones as emergency services work through the aftermath. Authorities are facing pressure to investigate safety standards and emergency response procedures.</p>
<h2>Violence in Washington DC Involves National Guard Members</h2>
<p>In Washington DC, two National Guard members were shot in a recent incident. Sarah Beckstrom, aged 20, died from her injuries, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition. The shooting has prompted discussions on security and safety for National Guard personnel serving in the capital. Former U.S. President Donald Trump commented publicly about the incident, highlighting the gravity of the situation.</p>
<h2>U.S. Migration Policy Announcement</h2>
<p>The U.S. president announced a "permanent pause" on migration from what he described as "third world countries," without specifying which nations would be affected. He further pledged to remove individuals he considers "not a net asset" to the country. This statement signals a stricter approach to immigration policy with potential impacts on migration flows and international relations, though details remain unclear.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>Guinea-Bissau’s president, Sissoco Embaló, fled to Senegal following a coup attempt. He arrived safely on a military-chartered plane. The coup marks a significant moment of instability in Guinea-Bissau, with the country’s political future uncertain. The situation will be closely monitored for developments and potential impacts on regional security.</p>
<h2>Floods Cause Heavy Losses in Asia</h2>
<p>Severe flooding across several Asian countries has caused significant casualties and damage. In Indonesia, at least 80 people have died in recent floods, while Sri Lanka reports 56 deaths over the past week due to extreme weather. These events highlight the ongoing challenges posed by climate-related disasters in the region and the need for effective disaster preparedness and response measures.</p>
<h2>Legal Ruling on Same-Sex Marriage in Japan</h2>
