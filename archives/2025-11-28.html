    <h2>Deadly Fire in Hong Kong Raises Questions</h2>
<p>A massive fire engulfed seven tower blocks in Hong Kong, becoming the city's deadliest blaze in decades. The rapid spread of the fire has led to public outrage and demands for accountability. Many are asking how the fire escalated so quickly and who should be held responsible for the tragedy. Meanwhile, families of those missing in the fire face an agonizing wait for news about their loved ones.</p>
<h2>Violence in Washington DC Affects National Guard</h2>
<p>In Washington DC, National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, aged 20, died following a shooting incident. Another guardsman, Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition. The shooting has raised concerns about the safety of service members stationed in the capital. President Donald Trump commented on the situation, providing updates about the victims.</p>
<h2>Migration Policy Announcement in the US</h2>
<p>The U.S. President announced a “permanent pause” on migration from what he described as “third world countries.” While no specific countries were named, the statement emphasized a policy to remove individuals deemed “not a net asset” to the United States. This announcement signals a significant shift in U.S. immigration policy, though details and implementation plans remain unclear.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>Political instability in Guinea-Bissau escalated as President Sissoco Embaló fled the country following a coup. He arrived safely in Senegal on a military-chartered plane, according to authorities. This development highlights ongoing challenges in the West African nation, where coups and political upheaval have been recurrent.</p>
<h2>Security Challenges in Nigeria</h2>
