    <h2>Ukraine Political Shake-Up</h2>
<p>Andriy Yermak, who has served as the chief of staff to the Ukrainian president throughout Russia's full-scale war, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home. The investigation signals ongoing efforts within Ukraine to address corruption amid the pressures of the ongoing conflict with Russia. Yermak's departure may lead to changes in the presidential administration during a critical period for the country.</p>
<h2>Deadly Fire in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Authorities have arrested eight more people in connection with a major fire in Hong Kong that killed at least 128 people. The blaze, which occurred on Wednesday, left 89 victims unidentified and 79 injured. The investigation is ongoing as officials work to determine the causes and hold responsible parties accountable for one of the city's deadliest fires.</p>
<h2>US Immigration and Security Debates</h2>
<p>The US president announced a pause on migration from so-called "third-world countries," without specifying exact nations. He emphasized a focus on removing those deemed "not a net asset" to the United States. Meanwhile, members of the Afghan community in the US have urged the administration against adopting a tougher stance following a shooting in Washington D.C. allegedly carried out by an Afghan national. These developments highlight ongoing tensions surrounding immigration and national security policies.</p>
<h2>Violence in Syria</h2>
<p>An Israeli military raid in the southern Syrian village of Beit Jinn resulted in the deaths of 13 people, marking the deadliest such operation in months. Israel stated the attack targeted militants, but Syria's foreign ministry condemned it as a "war crime." The incident underscores the continuing volatility in the region and may further strain relations between the two countries.</p>
<h2>International Legal and Human Rights Issues</h2>
<p>In South Africa, the daughter of a former president resigned amid allegations that she misled South Africans into joining the conflict in Ukraine. This resignation follows reports of the harsh realities faced by South African recruits in the war zone. Separately, Tunisia has sentenced dozens of opposition figures to prison, charging them with an attempted coup. Human rights groups have criticized the trial as politically motivated, raising concerns over political repression in the country.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery on Mars</h2>
<p>Scientists have detected lightning on Mars for the first time, based on electric crackles recorded over 28 hours across two Martian years. This new finding could provide insights into the planet's atmospheric conditions and electrical activity, furthering understanding of Mars’s environment and aiding future exploration efforts.</p>
