The incident has sparked public anger as investigations continue into the cause and response to the disaster.</p>
<h2>US Migration Policy Statement</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump announced plans to pause migration from what he described as "third-world countries," though he did not specify which nations would be affected.

This statement signals potential tightening of immigration policies, which could have implications for migration flows and international relations.</p>
