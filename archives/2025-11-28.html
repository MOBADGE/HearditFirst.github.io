    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">November 28, 2025</div>
    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Fire Aftermath</h2>
<p>The death toll from a recent high-rise fire in Hong Kong has risen to 128. Authorities report that of those fatalities, 89 bodies remain unidentified. Additionally, 79 people injured in the blaze are still receiving medical care. This tragic event highlights ongoing concerns about fire safety in densely populated urban areas. Investigations are likely to continue as officials determine causes and potential safety measures to prevent future disasters.</p>
<h2>US Migration Policy Statement</h2>
<p>The US president announced a pause in migration from unspecified "third-world countries." The statement emphasized a focus on removing individuals deemed "not a net asset" to the country. Details on the affected countries or the scope of the pause were not provided. This move signals a shift in US migration policy, potentially affecting immigration flows and related diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>Violence in Washington DC</h2>
<p>A member of the National Guard, Sarah Beckstrom, aged 20, died after being shot recently in Washington DC. Another guardsman involved in the shooting remains in critical condition. The US president publicly acknowledged the incident, underscoring concerns about violence affecting those serving in the National Guard. Authorities may increase efforts to address safety and security for service members.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Political Investigation</h2>
<p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agents have conducted a search of the home of Andriy Yermak, a top adviser involved in Ukraine’s dealings during the conflict with Russia. Yermak plays a key role in negotiating peace talks. This investigation comes amid ongoing efforts to combat corruption within Ukraine's political system, even as the country faces external military challenges.</p>
<h2>Legal Ruling on Same-Sex Marriage in Japan</h2>
<p>A Tokyo court ruled that Japan’s ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional. This decision contrasts with several previous rulings in other parts of Japan that had been more favorable to marriage equality advocates. The ruling represents a setback for those campaigning for legal recognition of same-sex unions in Japan, suggesting that national legal changes may be contentious and gradual.</p>
<h2>Middle East Security Incident</h2>
<p>An Israeli raid in southern Syria's village of Beit Jinn resulted in the deaths of ten people. Israel described the operation as targeting a militant group. This incident marks the deadliest Israeli strike in that region in recent months, reflecting ongoing tensions and conflict dynamics in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Updates</h2>
<p>The Louvre museum announced it will raise ticket prices by 45% for most non-European Union visitors. The revenue increase is intended to support renovation projects at the museum. In a separate cultural event, Pope Leo experienced difficulty unveiling a plaque covered by a cloth at an Istanbul cathedral, requiring multiple attempts before succeeding. These stories reflect ongoing developments in cultural and religious spheres.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Peru</h2>
<p>Two former Peruvian presidents, Pedro Castillo and Martín Vizcarra, have been jailed within the span of two days. They join a number of recent former presidents who have faced imprisonment, indicating continued political turmoil and legal accountability in Peru's leadership. These detentions may have significant impacts on the country’s political stability moving forward.</p>
