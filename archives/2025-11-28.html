    <h2>Tragic Fire in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>The death toll from a fire in Hong Kong has risen to 128 people. Authorities report that 89 of the victims have not yet been identified. The fire took place on Wednesday, and alongside the fatalities, 79 individuals remain injured. This incident is one of the deadliest in the city’s recent history, raising concerns about building safety and emergency response.</p>
<h2>U.S. Migration Policy Update</h2>
<p>The U.S. president announced plans to pause migration from unspecified "third-world countries." He did not provide details on which nations would be affected but emphasized a policy to remove individuals deemed "not a net asset" to the country. The move signals a tightening of immigration rules, though further clarity on its implementation is awaited.</p>
<h2>Violence in Washington D.C.</h2>
<p>A National Guard member named Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died following a shooting incident in Washington D.C. Another guard involved remains in critical condition. The shooting raises concerns about security and safety for military personnel stationed in the capital. The circumstances of the shooting have not been fully disclosed.</p>
<h2>Developments in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s anti-corruption agents have searched the home of Andriy Yermak, a key adviser to the country’s leadership. Yermak has been central to Ukraine’s response to the ongoing conflict with Russia and leads peace negotiations. The search could have implications for internal political dynamics during this critical period.</p>
<h2>Japan Court Upholds Same-Sex Marriage Ban</h2>
<p>A Tokyo court has ruled that the ban on same-sex marriage in Japan is constitutional. This decision goes against a recent trend from other courts in Japan, which had raised hopes for marriage equality. The ruling may affect the momentum of the LGBTQ+ rights movement in the country and influence future legal challenges.</p>
<h2>Science News: Lightning on Mars</h2>
