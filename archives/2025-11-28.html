    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">November 28, 2025</div>
    <h2>Ukraine Political Developments</h2>
<p>Andriy Yermak, who has been Ukrainian President Zelensky's closest adviser throughout the ongoing war with Russia, has resigned as chief of staff. The resignation follows an anti-corruption raid on Yermak’s home in Ukraine. This development comes amid ongoing challenges in the Ukrainian government during wartime, reflecting internal tensions and efforts to address corruption as the conflict continues.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Fire Investigation Continues</h2>
<p>Authorities have arrested eight more people in connection with a devastating fire that killed at least 128 people in Hong Kong last week. The fire left 89 victims unidentified and 79 people injured. The investigation into the tragedy is ongoing as officials seek to determine the cause and hold those responsible accountable. This remains one of the deadliest fires in Hong Kong’s recent history, raising concerns about building safety and emergency response.</p>
<h2>US Migration Policy Statement</h2>
<p>The US president announced plans to pause migration from what he described as "third-world countries." While he did not specify which nations would be affected, he emphasized removing individuals whom he considers "not a net asset" to the United States. This statement signals a stricter stance on immigration policy, though specific details and implications are yet to be clarified.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions Escalate</h2>
<p>A deadly raid in southern Syria carried out by Israeli forces resulted in the deaths of 13 people. Israel stated the attack targeted militants in the village of Beit Jinn. In response, Syria’s foreign ministry condemned the strike, labeling it a "war crime." This incident marks the deadliest Israeli military action in the region for months and intensifies the already volatile situation in Syria.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery on Mars</h2>
<p>Scientists have detected lightning on Mars for the first time. Electric crackles were recorded over 28 hours of data collected during two Martian years. This discovery could provide new insights into the planet’s atmospheric chemistry and weather patterns, enhancing understanding of Mars’ environment and its potential for supporting future exploration.</p>
<h2>Social and Legal News from Japan and Tunisia</h2>
<p>A Tokyo court ruled that the ban on same-sex marriage in Japan’s capital is constitutional. This verdict contradicts trends from other courts around Japan that had offered hope for marriage equality, marking a setback for LGBTQ+ rights activists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tunisia sentenced dozens of opposition figures to prison on charges of attempting a coup. Human rights groups claim the trial was politically motivated, suggesting growing political repression amid ongoing unrest in the country.</p>
