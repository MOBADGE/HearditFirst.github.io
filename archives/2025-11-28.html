    <h2>Ukraine Political Shake-Up</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home. Yermak, 54, has been a close adviser to President Zelensky throughout the ongoing conflict with Russia. The resignation comes amid growing scrutiny over corruption allegations, highlighting internal challenges in Ukraine’s leadership as it continues its fight with Russia.</p>
<h2>Deadly Fire in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested eight more people in connection with a recent devastating fire that killed at least 128 individuals. The blaze occurred on Wednesday, and officials report that 89 of the victims remain unidentified, while 79 people are still injured. The ongoing investigation continues as officials work to determine the cause and hold those responsible accountable.</p>
<h2>Hungary-Russia Relations</h2>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has again met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, despite opposition from other European Union members. Putin praised Orban for what he described as a “balanced position on the situation in Ukraine.” This visit reflects Hungary’s continuing unique stance within the EU regarding the conflict in Ukraine and could affect broader EU dynamics related to Russia policy.</p>
<h2>Migration Policy in the United States</h2>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to pause migration from what he described as “third-world countries.” Trump did not specify which nations would be directly affected but emphasized his administration’s intent to bar those considered “not a net asset” to the country. This policy signifies stricter migration controls and could impact immigration patterns and international relations.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Human Rights Concerns</h2>
<p>In southern Syria, an Israeli military raid targeting militants in the village of Beit Jinn resulted in the deaths of thirteen people. Israel justified the operation as a security measure, while Syria’s foreign ministry condemned it as a “war crime.” This incident is the deadliest Israeli raid in the region in months and underscores ongoing tensions and conflict risks in the area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Tunisia, dozens of opposition figures have received prison sentences after being accused of attempting a coup. Human rights groups argue the trial was politically motivated, raising concerns about the state of political freedoms and justice in the country.</p>
<h2>Science and Society Highlights</h2>
<p>Scientists have reported the first detection of lightning on Mars. This discovery emerged from electric crackles recorded over two Martian years, adding important information about the planet’s atmospheric conditions and weather phenomena.</p>
<p>In Japan, a Tokyo court ruled that the country’s ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional, a decision that contradicts recent court rulings elsewhere in Japan which had suggested movement towards marriage equality. This ruling affects the ongoing debate about LGBTQ+ rights in the country.</p>
<p>In another social story, three nuns who recently fled their convent were allowed to stay there on the condition that they leave social media. The nuns claim they were previously removed against their will and placed in a care home, highlighting an unusual dispute within a religious community.</p>
