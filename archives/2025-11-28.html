    <h2>Hong Kong Fire Investigation Continues</h2>
<p>Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested eight more people in connection with a devastating fire that occurred on Wednesday. The blaze killed at least 128 people, with 89 victims still unidentified. An additional 79 people remain injured as investigations proceed. The reasons behind the fire and those responsible are being examined as officials work to provide answers and support to affected families.</p>
<h2>Hungary-Russia Relations Deepen</h2>
<p>Hungarian leader Viktor Orban met again with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, in a move that goes against the positions of other European Union partners. Putin praised Orban for what he called a "balanced position on the situation in Ukraine." This meeting may affect diplomatic dynamics within Europe, especially relating to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the EU's unified stance.</p>
<h2>US Migration Policy Announcement</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump announced plans to pause migration from what he described as "third-world countries." Although specific nations were not named, the president emphasized his intention to remove anyone deemed "not a net asset" to the country. This development signals potential changes in US immigration policy, with wide-ranging effects on migration patterns and government screening processes.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Adviser Searched Amid Corruption Probe</h2>
<p>Anti-corruption agents in Ukraine have searched the home of Andriy Yermak, a key adviser involved in Ukraine’s response to Russia’s war and the lead negotiator in peace talks. This investigation reflects ongoing efforts within Ukraine to address corruption at high levels, even among influential figures playing critical roles in the country’s conflict and diplomacy.</p>
<h2>Japan Court Upholds Same-Sex Marriage Ban</h2>
<p>A Tokyo court has ruled that Japan’s ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional. This decision counters recent trends in other Japanese courts that had offered hope for marriage equality. The ruling means that, for now, legal recognition of same-sex marriages remains unavailable, shaping ongoing debates about LGBT rights in Japan.</p>
<h2>New Scientific Discovery: Lightning on Mars</h2>
<p>Scientists have detected lightning on Mars for the first time. Over 28 hours of recordings made during two Martian years captured electric crackles indicating lightning activity. This finding enhances our understanding of the Martian atmosphere and weather systems, offering new insights for future exploration and study of the planet.</p>
