    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 18, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>European Union leaders have begun high-stakes discussions on whether to lend tens of billions of euros from Russia's frozen assets to support Ukraine's military and economic needs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a serious warning amid these talks, highlighting the significance of the decision as Ukraine continues to face conflict pressures. The outcome will influence European support for Ukraine and the broader geopolitical landscape involving Russia.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, tensions escalated after the United States seized an oil tanker near the Venezuelan coast last week. The Venezuelan government strongly condemned a recent U.S. order to blockade ships, calling it “warmongering threats.” These developments come amid ongoing pressure on Venezuela’s leadership under Nicolás Maduro and illustrate rising diplomatic and security confrontations between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Ukraine’s Defense Industry</h2>
<p>Inside Ukraine, efforts to bolster domestic military capabilities are intensifying. A secret factory is actively producing new long-range missiles, representing a significant step in Ukraine's drive to strengthen its arms industry amid ongoing conflict. This expansion of local arms production aims to reduce reliance on foreign supplies and enhance Ukraine’s defense readiness for the months ahead.</p>
<h2>Law and Justice</h2>
<p>In France, Frédéric Péchier was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of poisoning patients by contaminating infusion bags with substances that caused fatal cardiac arrests or hemorrhages. The case, which has drawn significant public attention, sheds light on medical malpractice and its consequences, reinforcing the imperative for healthcare safety and accountability.</p>
<h2>Australia: Response to Bondi Shooting</h2>
<p>The family of Matilda, the 10-year-old victim of the recent Bondi shooting, called for love and happiness to prevail over anger during her funeral. Her aunt, Lina Chernykh, described Matilda as a child who spread joy wherever she went, asking people to remember her in a positive light.</p>
<p>In response to the shooting, the Australian Prime Minister announced a new crackdown on hate speech. This includes tougher penalties for individuals who spread hate and new powers allowing the government to cancel or refuse visas, aiming to curb violence and promote social cohesion in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p>
<h2>U.S. Political and Military Developments</h2>
<p>Dan Bongino, who served as deputy director of the FBI, announced his decision to step down. This followed remarks from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who stated Bongino "wants to go back to his show," referencing Bongino's background in media.</p>
<p>Separately, Donald Trump defended his economic record during an address, highlighting accomplishments from his nearly year-long return to office. He also announced a "warriors dividend" for U.S. troops, while attributing ongoing economic difficulties to opposition from Democrats. These statements reflect ongoing partisan debates as both sides vie to influence public opinion before future political contests.</p>
<h2>Sports News</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck Ecuador's football community with the shooting death of defender Mario Pineida at the age of 33. Pineida was shot outside a shop in Guayaquil, marking a sad loss for the player’s family and fans alike. His passing highlights concerns about violence impacting athletes outside the sports arena.</p>
