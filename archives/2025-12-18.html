    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 18, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics and Unrest</h2>
<p>Violence erupted in Bangladesh following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a youth protest leader associated with the movement that led to the ousting of former prime minister Sheik Hasina. The unrest highlights ongoing tensions in the country’s political landscape and may affect future stability depending on how authorities and communities respond.</p>
<h2>United States: Tragedy and Policy Changes</h2>
<p>A small plane crash at a regional airport in North Carolina resulted in seven deaths, including former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his wife, and two children. The incident has shocked the community and the sports world as investigations continue into the cause.</p>
<p>In a major shift in U.S. drug policy, President Donald Trump issued an order reclassifying cannabis to the same category as Tylenol with codeine. This marks the most significant change since 1971, potentially expanding access and altering enforcement priorities around cannabis nationwide.</p>
<p>Separately, Trump Media, known for the Truth Social platform, announced a surprising $6 billion merger with a fusion energy company. This move represents a diversification from social media into the energy sector and could have broad implications for the company’s future business direction.</p>
<h2>Legal and Criminal Developments</h2>
<p>A French court sentenced Frédéric Péchier, nicknamed the ‘Doctor Death,’ to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of poisoning patients by contaminating infusion bags that led to cardiac arrests and hemorrhaging. This verdict closes a high-profile case involving medical malpractice with deadly consequences.</p>
<p>In Romania, rapper Wiz Khalifa was sentenced in absentia to nine months in jail for smoking cannabis on stage at a festival last year. The case underscores differing international laws and enforcement attitudes toward drug use in entertainment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats in the United States released a new batch of materials related to Jeffrey Epstein, including photos of women’s passports and disturbing quotes inscribed on a woman’s body. This release comes as a deadline looms for the Justice Department, signaling ongoing political and legal battles surrounding the Epstein case.</p>
<h2>Religion and Leadership</h2>
<p>Pope Leo has appointed Ronald Hicks, 58, from Chicago, as the next archbishop of New York, replacing Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Hicks will lead New York’s Catholic community, which numbers approximately 2.5 million. His leadership may influence the direction of one of the largest dioceses in the United States.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Public Safety</h2>
<p>In Australia, the prime minister announced new measures to tighten laws against hate speech after a recent shooting in Bondi. The crackdown will introduce fresh penalties for spreading hate and expand government powers to cancel or refuse visas, aiming to enhance public safety and social cohesion.</p>
<p>In the United States, Kristin Cabot, a human resources executive, spoke out after being targeted with abusive and threatening messages online. The backlash followed her appearance with her boss on a ‘kiss-cam’ during a Coldplay concert, highlighting ongoing issues around online harassment in the digital age.</p>
