    <h2>United States: Ongoing Investigation and Tragic Accident</h2>
<p>Authorities have issued an arrest warrant for a suspect connected to a shooting at Brown University that resulted in the deaths of two students and injuries to nine others. Investigators are also looking for a rental car believed to be linked to the suspect. The search is ongoing as the community awaits further updates on this violent incident.</p>
<p>In separate news, a small plane crash in North Carolina has claimed the lives of seven people, including former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his wife, and two children. Officials confirmed all those who boarded the plane died in the accident. The tragedy is being investigated by local authorities.</p>
<h2>International Politics and Conflict</h2>
<p>European Union leaders are currently debating a proposal to use frozen Russian assets to provide tens of billions of euros to support Ukraine's military and economic needs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a serious warning amid the discussions, highlighting the urgency and stakes involved. The outcome of these talks could significantly impact the ongoing conflict in the region.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, unrest has erupted following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth protest leader involved in the political movement that led to the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheik Hasina. The violence underscores continuing tensions in the country’s political landscape.</p>
<h2>Religion: New Leadership in New York</h2>
<p>Pope Leo has appointed Ronald Hicks as the next archbishop of New York. Hicks, 58, from Chicago, will succeed Cardinal Timothy Dolan and take responsibility for leading the spiritual and administrative needs of New York’s 2.5 million Catholics. This change in leadership marks an important transition for the archdiocese.</p>
<h2>Legal and Cultural Developments</h2>
<p>In Romania, the rapper Wiz Khalifa has been sentenced in absentia to nine months in jail for smoking cannabis during a festival performance last year. Meanwhile, in the United States, President Donald Trump has signed an order to reclassify cannabis, placing it alongside drugs like Tylenol with codeine. This action is regarded as the most significant shift in U.S. drug policy since 1971 and could have wide-reaching implications for cannabis regulation.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>A high-profile criminal case concluded in France as Frédéric Péchier, dubbed the "Doctor Death," was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was found guilty of contaminating medical infusion bags, which caused severe cardiac arrests or hemorrhages in patients. This judgment addresses serious concerns about medical safety and accountability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the U.S., Democrats have released a new set of photos related to the Jeffrey Epstein case ahead of a Justice Department deadline. The images include women’s passports and disturbing messages written on a woman's body, continuing the efforts to bring transparency and justice in this long-running investigation.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Personal Impact</h2>
<p>Kristin Cabot, a human resources executive who became widely known after a viral video showed her with her boss on a "kiss-cam," has described facing abuse and threats online. She is currently trying to find a new job amid the fallout. This situation highlights ongoing challenges related to online harassment and privacy.</p>
