    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 18, 2025</div>
    <h2>Europe and Ukraine</h2>
<p>European Union leaders have begun important discussions on whether to loan tens of billions of euros from Russia's frozen assets to support Ukraine’s military and economic needs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a serious warning as these crunch talks unfold, highlighting the urgency and stakes involved. If approved, this funding could significantly impact Ukraine’s ongoing situation and the broader regional stability.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime News</h2>
<p>In France, Frédéric Péchier, known in the media as the "Doctor Death," has been sentenced to life imprisonment. A court found him guilty of poisoning infusion bags given to patients, causing severe medical emergencies such as cardiac arrest and hemorrhaging. This verdict follows a criminal trial addressing death and harm caused in medical settings, underscoring ongoing concerns about patient safety.</p>
<h2>Australia: Social Tensions and Political Response</h2>
<p>Australia has been responding to recent violence in Bondi, where a 10-year-old victim named Matilda has been mourned by family members who pleaded for calm and rejected calls for anger. Her aunt described Matilda as a joyous child who spread love widely.</p>
<p>In response to the incident, the Australian Prime Minister announced a crackdown on hate speech. The new measures will impose stricter penalties on those spreading hate and introduce powers to cancel or refuse visas. These policy steps are aimed at preventing hate-driven violence and promoting social cohesion.</p>
<h2>US Political and Military Developments</h2>
<p>Former US political figure Donald Trump addressed supporters, promoting his record during 11 months back in office. He announced a "warriors dividend" for troops and placed blame on Democrats for ongoing economic difficulties. This speech reflects Trump's continued active role in political discourse and efforts to influence public opinion on economic and military matters.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dan Bongino, who has served as deputy director of the FBI and previously worked as a podcaster, announced he will leave the FBI. The former US president indicated that Bongino wants to return to his previous media work, signaling potential shifts in the agency and related political dynamics.</p>
<h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in Southeast Asia as Thailand carried out bombings near the Cambodia border crossing at Poipet. The attacks come amid ongoing border clashes between the two countries, suggesting that hostilities show little sign of de-escalating.</p>
<p>In West Africa, Nigeria has formally apologized over an incident involving Burkina Faso military personnel detained on a Nigerian military flight. Although the 11 servicemen have been released, they have not yet returned home, indicating unresolved diplomatic or logistical issues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Venezuela has condemned a recent US order to blockade a ship, calling it a "warmongering threat." This escalation follows the US seizure of an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast, increasing pressure on Nicolás Maduro’s government and contributing to already strained US-Venezuela relations.</p>
<h2>Notable Death</h2>
<p>Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning war reporter known for his coverage of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars, has died at the age of 91. He was notable for conducting interviews with prominent figures such as Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. His passing marks the loss of a significant figure in war journalism.</p>
