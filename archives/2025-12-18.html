    <h2>Ukraine and EU Discuss Use of Russia's Frozen Assets</h2>
<p>EU leaders are currently deciding whether to lend tens of billions of euros from frozen Russian funds to support Ukraine's military and economic efforts. This move reflects ongoing efforts to provide substantial aid amid the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a stark warning, underlining the urgency of securing these resources. The decision outcome could significantly impact Ukraine’s ability to sustain its defense and recovery.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>In France, Frédéric Péchier, dubbed the "Doctor Death," has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of poisoning patients through contaminated infusion bags, causing fatal cardiac arrests or hemorrhaging. This case concludes a high-profile criminal proceeding involving medical malpractice with serious consequences.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nigeria has issued an apology to Burkina Faso following an incident where 11 Nigerian military personnel were detained after a flight landing. The servicemen have since been released but remain outside Nigeria. This diplomatic exchange highlights ongoing sensitivities in regional military relations.</p>
<h2>Changes in US Drug Policy and Media-Energy Merger</h2>
<p>The United States has seen a major shift in drug classification policies under President Donald Trump, who signed an order reclassifying cannabis into the same category as Tylenol with codeine. This marks the most significant federal change in cannabis policy since 1971 and could impact medical and recreational use regulations as well as law enforcement practices.</p>
<p>In business news, Trump's media company, known for the Truth Social platform, is set to merge with a fusion energy firm in a deal valued at $6 billion. This move signals a surprising diversification into the energy sector and may affect the company's strategic direction.</p>
<h2>Security and Military Updates</h2>
<p>Following renewed border tensions, Thailand has carried out bombings near Cambodia’s Poipet border crossing. The incident is part of ongoing clashes that show no sign of abating and reflects continuing instability in the region.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dan Bongino, who has served as deputy director of the FBI and is a former podcaster, announced his resignation. His departure follows statements from President Trump indicating Bongino’s desire to return to his media career.</p>
<h2>Obituary: Peter Arnett, War Reporter</h2>
<p>Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist renowned for his frontline coverage of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars, has died at the age of 91. He was also noted for interviewing significant figures including Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Arnett’s reporting had a notable impact on international journalism and war reporting.</p>
