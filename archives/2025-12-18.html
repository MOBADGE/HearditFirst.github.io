    <h2>Europe-Ukraine-Russia Financial Talks</h2>
<p>European Union leaders are considering a proposal to loan tens of billions of euros from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. The funds would be used to meet Ukraine’s military and economic needs amid ongoing conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a stark warning emphasizing the urgency and importance of the decision, highlighting the potential impact on Ukraine's defense and recovery efforts. The outcome of this EU discussion could significantly influence the trajectory of the conflict and Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russian advancements.</p>
<h2>US Drug Policy Shift on Cannabis</h2>
<p>In the United States, a major shift in federal drug policy is expected as President Donald Trump plans to issue an order reclassifying cannabis. The proposal would place cannabis in the same category as Tylenol with codeine, signaling a significant change since cannabis was first regulated under the Controlled Substances Act in 1971. This reclassification may expand legal access to cannabis, marking a notable departure from longstanding drug restrictions and potentially influencing public health and regulatory frameworks nationwide.</p>
<h2>Australian Government Targets Hate Speech</h2>
<p>Following a shooting incident at Bondi, the Australian Prime Minister announced new measures aimed at cracking down on hate speech. The government plans to introduce harsher penalties for individuals who spread hate, along with granting authorities expanded powers to cancel or refuse visas to those involved. These steps reflect a heightened government effort to address social divisions and prevent violence linked to hate-fueled rhetoric.</p>
<h2>International Tensions on Southeast Asia Border</h2>
<p>Renewed hostilities along the Thailand-Cambodia border have escalated with recent bombings near the Poipet crossing. These developments come amid ongoing clashes that show little sign of abating. The continuing violence stresses the fragile security situation in the region, with potential implications for bilateral relations and regional stability.</p>
<h2>Notable Death and Career Moves</h2>
<p>The journalism community marks the passing of Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning war reporter known for his coverage of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars and interviews with figures such as Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Separately, Dan Bongino, who served as FBI deputy director and is a former podcaster, announced he is stepping down following comments from President Trump indicating Bongino intends to return to media work.</p>
<h2>Business and Defense Updates from Donald Trump</h2>
<p>Donald Trump remains active in public and economic spheres. He recently defended his record during 11 months back in office by announcing a "warrior dividend" for troops, attributing ongoing economic difficulties to opposition from Democrats. Meanwhile, Trump’s media company behind the Truth Social platform revealed plans to merge with a nuclear fusion firm in a $6 billion deal, indicating a diversification into the energy sector. These moves suggest Trump’s continued influence in political, economic, and business arenas.</p>
