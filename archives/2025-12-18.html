    <h2>Political Unrest in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Violence erupted in Bangladesh following the death of youth protest leader Sharif Osman Hadi. Hadi played a key role in a movement that led to the removal of former prime minister Sheik Hasina. The unrest highlights ongoing political tensions and could impact the country's stability in the near term, with possible implications for governance and public order.</p>
<h2>US Plane Crash Claims Seven Lives</h2>
<p>A small plane crash at a regional airport in North Carolina resulted in seven fatalities, including former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and members of his family. Officials confirmed Biffle was among those on board. This tragic event has drawn attention to aviation safety and will likely prompt investigations into the cause of the crash.</p>
<h2>EU Considers Using Russian Frozen Funds for Ukraine</h2>
<p>European Union leaders are deliberating whether to use tens of billions of euros of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's military and economic needs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a stark warning as these discussions take place, emphasizing the importance of financial aid for Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict. The decision may influence the EU's role in the war and the broader geopolitical landscape.</p>
<h2>New Archbishop Named for New York</h2>
<p>Pope Leo appointed Ronald Hicks, a 58-year-old from Chicago, as the new archbishop of New York. He will succeed Cardinal Timothy Dolan and lead the city's 2.5 million Catholics. This leadership change may affect the direction of the archdiocese and its engagement with the local community going forward.</p>
<h2>Changes in US Cannabis Policy and Related Sentencing Abroad</h2>
<p>In the United States, Donald Trump signed an order that reclassifies cannabis alongside Tylenol with codeine, marking the most significant drug policy shift since 1971. This could expand access to cannabis across the country and reshape regulatory approaches.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Romania, rapper Wiz Khalifa was sentenced in absentia to nine months in jail for smoking cannabis on stage at a festival last year. These developments show contrasting legal approaches to cannabis use internationally.</p>
<h2>Australian Government Targets Hate Speech</h2>
<p>Following a shooting incident in Bondi, Australia, the prime minister announced new measures to tackle hate speech. The policies include stricter penalties for individuals spreading hate and enhanced powers to refuse or cancel visas. This initiative aims to address social tensions and improve public safety.</p>
