    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 18, 2025</div>
    <h2>Europe and Ukraine</h2>
<p>European Union leaders are currently debating a proposal to loan tens of billions of euros from Russia’s frozen assets to support Ukraine’s military and economic needs. The decision comes amid ongoing conflict and aims to bolster Ukraine’s ability to sustain itself. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky urged a firm stance, warning of the importance of using these funds to aid his country’s defense. The outcome of this discussion could significantly impact the region’s security and economic stability.</p>
<h2>United States Drug Policy Shift</h2>
<p>In a major change to U.S. drug policy, President Donald Trump is expected to order the reclassification of cannabis to the same category as Tylenol with codeine. This move would mark the most significant update in drug scheduling since 1971, potentially expanding legal access to cannabis across the country. The adjustment reflects shifting attitudes toward cannabis and could influence healthcare and law enforcement policies nationwide.</p>
<h2>Legal and Security Developments</h2>
<p>In France, a doctor nicknamed “Doctor Death” has been sentenced to life imprisonment after a court found him guilty of contaminating infusion bags with substances that caused serious health crises, including cardiac arrest and hemorrhaging. This case has drawn attention to medical safety and criminal accountability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Australia, the Prime Minister announced a crackdown on hate speech following a shooting incident in Bondi. New measures include increased penalties for spreading hate and enhanced powers to cancel or refuse visas for offenders. This step aims to address growing concerns about social tensions and public safety.</p>
<h2>Asia Border Conflict</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high between Thailand and Cambodia as bombings occurred near the Poipet border crossing. These attacks are part of ongoing clashes in the area, with no sign of resolution yet. The situation underscores the fragility of relations and the risk of escalating violence in the region.</p>
<h2>Notable Figures and Business Moves</h2>
<p>Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist known for his war reporting in Vietnam and the Gulf and for interviewing figures like Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, has died at the age of 91. His career left a lasting impact on war journalism.</p>
<p>In the business world, Trump Media, known for the social platform Truth Social, announced a merger with a fusion energy company in a $6 billion deal. This unexpected move signals a diversification of interests and a potential new direction for the company.</p>
<h2>U.S. Government and Military Updates</h2>
<p>Dan Bongino, currently serving as the FBI deputy director, announced his resignation. The decision followed comments from Donald Trump indicating Bongino wants to return to his media career.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump highlighted a “warrior dividend” for troops during a recent address, defending his economic record from his 11 months back in office while attributing lingering economic challenges to opposition Democrats. This message reflects ongoing debates about economic policy and military support in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Africa Diplomatic Incident</h2>
<p>Nigeria apologized to Burkina Faso over the detention of 11 Nigerian military servicemen after a flight incident involving both countries. Although the servicemen have been released, they have not yet returned home. The situation highlights ongoing diplomatic sensitivities and military cooperation challenges in West Africa.</p>
