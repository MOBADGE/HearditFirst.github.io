    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 18, 2025</div>
    <h2>Europe and Ukraine: EU Considers Using Frozen Russian Assets</h2>
<p>The European Union is currently debating whether to loan tens of billions of euros from frozen Russian funds to support Ukraine’s military and economic needs. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky issued a strong warning emphasizing the urgency of this move, as Ukraine continues to face significant challenges amid ongoing conflict. This decision could signal a new level of financial support from the EU to Ukraine, potentially impacting the dynamics of the conflict and Europe's stance towards Russia.</p>
<h2>United States: Major Changes in Cannabis Policy</h2>
<p>A significant shift in U.S. drug policy has been announced, with an order reclassifying cannabis into the same drug category as Tylenol with codeine. This represents the most notable change since 1971, potentially expanding access to cannabis and altering regulatory approaches nationwide. Meanwhile, former U.S. President Donald Trump continues to promote his economic achievements in a recent address, announcing a "warrior dividend" for troops and critiquing Democrats for ongoing economic difficulties.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime News: High-Profile Sentencing and Court Decisions</h2>
<p>In France, Frédéric Péchier was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of poisoning patients by contaminating infusion bags, leading to cardiac arrests or hemorrhaging. This case has drawn attention due to the severity and nature of the crimes. In Romania, rapper Wiz Khalifa was sentenced in absentia to nine months in jail for smoking cannabis on stage during a festival last year, highlighting continuing legal consequences for drug use in various countries.</p>
<h2>Australia: New Measures Targeting Hate Speech</h2>
<p>Following a recent shooting in Bondi, the Australian Prime Minister announced a crackdown on hate speech. The new measures include stricter penalties for those spreading hate and enhanced powers to cancel or refuse visas, aiming to reduce tensions and prevent further incidents related to hate-driven violence or harassment. This reflects growing concerns about the impact of hate speech on public safety and social cohesion.</p>
<h2>Media and Public Figures: Viral Incident and Notable Death</h2>
<p>A former tech executive who appeared in a viral clip during a Coldplay concert has spoken out about receiving abusive and threatening messages after being filmed alongside her boss on a "kiss-cam." She described her experience of trying to find a new job amid the backlash. On a different note, Pulitzer Prize-winning war reporter Peter Arnett passed away at the age of 91. Arnett was known for his reporting on the Vietnam and Gulf Wars and notable interviews with figures such as Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.</p>
<h2>International Relations: Nigeria and Burkina Faso Military Incident</h2>
<p>Nigeria has issued an apology following the detention of 11 Nigerian military personnel by Burkina Faso after a military flight incident. Although the servicemen have been released, they have not yet returned home. The episode has raised diplomatic concerns and the countries appear to be working towards a resolution to ease tensions.</p>
