    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 18, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>The European Union is in talks about using tens of billions of euros of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine’s military and economic needs. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a stark warning to EU leaders about the situation. Meanwhile, renewed border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia continue, with Thailand conducting bombings near the Poipet border crossing, signaling ongoing tensions that show no immediate sign of resolution.</p>
<h2>Law and Justice</h2>
<p>In France, Frédéric Péchier has been sentenced to life in prison after a court found him guilty of poisoning infusion bags, causing cardiac arrest and hemorrhaging in patients. This case highlights serious concerns about medical safety and criminal actions within healthcare settings.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the government has issued an apology to Burkina Faso following the detention of 11 Nigerian servicemen related to a military flight incident. Although the personnel have been released, they have not yet returned to Nigeria, indicating ongoing diplomatic or logistical issues between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Politics and Government</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump announced a "warriors dividend" aimed at military troops during an address where he defended his economic record during his recent 11 months in office. He also blamed Democrats for continued economic challenges. In related news, Dan Bongino is stepping down as deputy director of the FBI, a move reportedly influenced by Trump's comments about wanting Bongino to return to his media career.</p>
<h2>Social Issues in Australia</h2>
<p>The family of Matilda, a 10-year-old victim of a recent shooting in Bondi, has asked the public not to let her death fuel anger. Her aunt described Matilda as a joyous child who spread love. In response to this tragedy, the Australian Prime Minister announced new measures to crack down on hate speech. These include additional penalties for individuals who spread hate and new powers to cancel or refuse visas, aimed at addressing and reducing such harmful rhetoric.</p>
<h2>Business and Technology</h2>
<p>Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social platform, is making a notable shift by merging with a nuclear fusion company in a deal valued at $6 billion. This unexpected move signals the company’s entry into the energy sector and could mark a significant diversification of its business interests.</p>
<h2>Remembering a Journalist</h2>
<p>Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning war reporter known for his coverage of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars and interviews with Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, has died at the age of 91. His career left a significant impact on war journalism and international reporting.</p>
