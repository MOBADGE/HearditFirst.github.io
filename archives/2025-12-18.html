    <h2>Ukraine and EU Discuss Use of Frozen Russian Assets</h2>
<p>EU leaders are considering a plan to loan tens of billions of euros from frozen Russian funds to support Ukraine’s military and economic recovery. Ukrainian leader Zelensky warned of the importance of accessing these resources as the conflict with Russia continues. The decision reflects growing European support for Ukraine but raises complex legal and political questions about the management of confiscated foreign assets.</p>
<h2>US Drug Policy Shift on Cannabis</h2>
<p>In a significant change to US drug laws, President Trump has signed an order reclassifying cannabis to the same category as Tylenol with codeine. This move marks the most substantial revision of cannabis policy since 1971, expanding legal access for medical and potentially recreational use. The reclassification could impact healthcare, law enforcement, and the cannabis industry nationwide.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>- Frédéric Péchier, known as the French ‘Doctor Death,’ was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of poisoning patients by contaminating infusion bags. The verdict closes a harrowing chapter in France’s recent medical history.</p>
<p>- Wiz Khalifa, the American rapper, was sentenced to nine months in jail in Romania after admitting to smoking cannabis on stage at a festival last year. The sentence was issued in absentia.</p>
<p>- Nigerian authorities apologized to Burkina Faso following the detention of 11 Nigerian military personnel aboard a flight. Though the servicemen have been released, they have yet to return to Nigeria, highlighting ongoing regional security sensitivities.</p>
<h2>Australian Crackdown on Hate Speech</h2>
<p>In response to a recent shooting in Bondi, the Australian Prime Minister announced a new policy to tighten measures against hate speech. The plan includes fresh penalties targeting individuals spreading hate and expands government power to cancel or refuse visas. The initiative seeks to address social tensions and prevent inflammatory rhetoric from fueling violence.</p>
<h2>Media and Energy Sector News</h2>
<p>Trump Media, the company behind the Truth Social platform, revealed a surprise $6 billion merger with a fusion energy firm. This deal represents a notable shift as the media company expands into the energy sector, signaling a diversification of its business interests.</p>
<h2>Remembering Peter Arnett</h2>
<p>Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist known for his war reporting during the Vietnam and Gulf Wars, and notable interviews with Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, has died at age 91. His career left a lasting impact on war journalism and global news coverage.</p>
<h2>Political Commentary from Trump</h2>
<p>In a recent address, Trump promoted what he called a ‘warrior dividend’ for military personnel while defending his economic record during his 11 months in office. He placed blame for ongoing economic challenges on Democrats, emphasizing his administration’s achievements in various areas.</p>
