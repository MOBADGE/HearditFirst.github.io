    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">November 30, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Venezuela has strongly condemned a recent statement by Donald Trump threatening to close the country's airspace. The United States claims this action is part of efforts to combat drug smuggling. However, Venezuela counters that the real goal is to overthrow President Nicolás Maduro. This dispute adds tension to already strained relations between the two countries and may impact diplomatic and security dynamics in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, Ukraine has escalated its conflict with Russia by striking two tanker ships in the Black Sea using drones. These tankers are believed to have been involved in bypassing Western sanctions imposed on Russia. This action marks a further intensification in the ongoing tensions and could influence future maritime security and sanction enforcement efforts.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>Southeast Asia is facing severe flooding, described as some of the worst in recent years. Millions of people across Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand have been affected by the floods, with hundreds reported dead or missing. The disaster highlights the region's vulnerability to extreme weather events, bringing urgent attention to disaster preparedness and the need for coordinated relief efforts.</p>
<h2>Crime and Public Safety</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting occurred at a child’s birthday party in California, resulting in four deaths and injuries to ten others, including children. Police have described the incident as "targeted," though details about suspects or motives remain limited. This event raises concerns about gun violence and community safety in the area.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, fear grips a community after hundreds of schoolchildren were kidnapped by bandits. Despite knowing where the perpetrators are hiding, parents are reportedly too afraid to approach authorities. This situation underscores ongoing challenges with security and protection of children in parts of Nigeria.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Highlights</h2>
<p>In Ireland, the government has introduced some of the world's strongest alcohol warning labels, highlighting cancer risks linked to drinking. These warnings are part of broader efforts to address drinking as a widespread cultural practice, with the hope that stronger messaging might influence consumption habits.</p>
<p>In India, recently discovered photographs shed light on women’s significant roles in Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience movement against British rule. These images serve to recognize and celebrate women’s contributions to the country’s freedom struggle, which have often been overlooked in historical accounts.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Stories</h2>
<p>In Australia, a major fire at a waste facility in western Sydney resulted in a massive explosion that launched a chemical tank into the air. The incident drew attention due to the scale of the fireball and the potential hazards associated with chemical storage.</p>
<p>In France, a snail farm named L'Escargot Des Grands Crus suffered a substantial theft of snails valued at €90,000. The theft was particularly damaging as the farm was preparing for holiday season deliveries.</p>
<p>Finally, in Gaza, a new business has emerged focused on repairing damaged banknotes. This service has grown since banks were destroyed and cash transfers stopped following conflict with Israel. The effort to restore physical currency highlights the challenges faced by residents trying to maintain financial stability amid ongoing disruption.</p>
