    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>In north-eastern Ukraine, a Russian drone strike targeted a crowded passenger train, killing at least four people. Ukrainian officials condemned the attack, highlighting ongoing violence in the region. The incident underscores the continuing instability and civilian risks amid the conflict.</p>
<h2>Immigration and Legal Changes</h2>
<p>Spain announced plans to grant legal status to around half a million undocumented migrants. Eligible individuals are foreign nationals without criminal records who can prove residence in Spain for at least five months prior to the end of 2025. This move aims to provide legal security to a significant part of the migrant population.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, the federal agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will send agents to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, Italy. Though the agency says it will not engage in immigration enforcement during the event, the decision has sparked anger in Italy.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>In France, former senator Joel Guerriau was sentenced to four years in prison, with 18 months to be served behind bars. He was found guilty of drugging a member of parliament, marking a notable legal development involving a former public official.</p>
<p>In the United States, families of six individuals killed when a boat was struck off the coast of Venezuela filed a lawsuit. The victims, including Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, were Trinidadian men returning home when the incident occurred on 14 October.</p>
<h2>Environmental Challenges</h2>
<p>Australia is currently facing a severe heatwave, with firefighters in the state of Victoria combating at least six major fires classified as emergency level. The extreme temperatures and multiple blazes are posing significant challenges to emergency services.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Crime Policy</h2>
<p>Sweden is proposing to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 13, citing concerns over gang recruitment of children. Critics argue that the move could criminalize even younger children and potentially violate children's rights. The debate reflects concerns about youth crime and public safety.</p>
<h2>Trade and Economy</h2>
<p>India and the European Union announced a major trade agreement, described as the "mother of all trade deals." The pact comes amid economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States, signaling a strategic shift in trade relations for both Delhi and Brussels.</p>
<h2>Culture and Trends</h2>
<p>In China, "crying horse" toys have gained viral popularity ahead of the Lunar New Year. These toys, known for their frowning expressions, were originally made by mistake but have resonated with young workers, reflecting broader cultural sentiments.</p>
