    <h2>International Trade Moves</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a long-awaited trade deal amid economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States. This agreement marks a significant step in strengthening economic ties between Delhi and Brussels. While details of the deal were not specified, it is expected to influence trade patterns and diplomatic relations in the coming years as both parties navigate changing global economic landscapes.</p>
<p>In contrast, tensions between the US and South Korea have increased. The United States has raised tariffs on South Korean imports to 25%, accusing Seoul of not fulfilling terms of a trade deal reached last year. This escalation in trade measures could have wider implications for US-South Korea economic relations and regional trade dynamics in East Asia.</p>
<h2>Weather and Safety Challenges</h2>
<p>A severe winter storm in the United States has caused widespread disruption, delaying flights and leaving thousands without power across multiple states. Officials have reported at least a dozen deaths linked to the storm, underscoring its deadly impact. This event highlights ongoing vulnerabilities to extreme weather in parts of the US and the challenges emergency services face during such events.</p>
<p>Australia is contending with intense heatwave conditions, particularly in Victoria where firefighters are battling at least six major blazes. Authorities have classified the situation as "emergency level," reflecting the severity of the fires amid record-breaking temperatures. The continuing heat and dry conditions present increased risks of further wildfires, making firefighting efforts a high priority.</p>
<h2>Health and Security Alerts</h2>
<p>A Nipah virus outbreak in India has led to heightened precautions in the region, with airports in Thailand and Nepal beginning to screen passengers arriving from West Bengal. The screenings are part of efforts to contain the virus’s spread across borders and prevent a wider health crisis in Asia.</p>
<p>Separately, the International Criminal Court (ICC) judges have ruled that Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte is fit to face proceedings related to accusations of crimes against humanity linked to his drug war. The ICC case may influence international legal standards on accountability for such allegations.</p>
<h2>Legal and Policy Developments</h2>
<p>A Japanese court has ordered compensation for migrants who were lured to North Korea with promises of an ideal life, described by the plaintiffs as being marketed as a "paradise on Earth." This ruling addresses historical grievances and may affect future diplomatic and legal approaches to cases involving migration and deception.</p>
<p>In France, the lower house of parliament has voted in favor of a bill that would ban social media use for children under 15 years old. If approved by the upper house, the law could take effect by the start of the new school year in September. The bill represents a significant policy move aimed at protecting young people from potential harms associated with early social media exposure.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Media Trends</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, is launching trials for premium subscription services. While the core features of these platforms will remain free, the new subscriptions could offer additional benefits to users willing to pay. This development indicates a shift towards diversified revenue models in social media platforms, potentially influencing how users engage with online services.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy Shift</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, a key figure in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, is set to leave Minneapolis. His reassignment appears to signal a change in the White House's tone on immigration enforcement. This move could precede adjustments to immigration policies and operational strategies in the region.</p>
