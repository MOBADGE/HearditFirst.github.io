    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The United States plans to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina this February. However, the US federal agency clarified that it will not be involved in immigration enforcement at the event. The announcement has sparked anger in Italy, reflecting sensitivities around the role foreign law enforcement plays during major international events.</p>
<h2>Protests and Human Rights</h2>
<p>In Iran, young protesters have shared with the BBC accounts of brutal crackdowns by security forces earlier this month. Many have witnessed friends and acquaintances killed during the suppression of demonstrations. These personal testimonies highlight ongoing tensions and raise concerns about human rights abuses amid political unrest.</p>
<h2>Migration Policy</h2>
<p>Spain has announced a plan to grant legal status to around 500,000 undocumented migrants. Eligibility requires that applicants have no criminal record and can prove residence in Spain for at least five months before the end of 2025. This initiative aims to provide a pathway to legality for many who have been living in the country without documents, signaling a significant shift in immigration policy.</p>
<h2>Environment and Disasters</h2>
<p>In Australia, firefighters in the state of Victoria are battling at least six major wildfires amid a record-breaking heatwave. The authorities have declared the situation to be of emergency level, with efforts focused on containing the blazes as extreme weather conditions continue. The fires are putting considerable strain on firefighting resources and raise concerns about climate-related risks in the region.</p>
<h2>Trade and Economy</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a new trade deal described as the "mother of all trade deals." The agreement comes as both parties face economic and geopolitical challenges, including pressure from the United States. This deal is expected to deepen economic ties between Delhi and Brussels and may influence global trade dynamics going forward.</p>
<h2>Social Issues</h2>
<p>Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 13 in response to concerns over gang recruitment of children. Critics argue that this move could criminalize even younger children and potentially infringe on children's rights. The debate reflects wider challenges in addressing youth involvement in crime while balancing legal and social protections.</p>
