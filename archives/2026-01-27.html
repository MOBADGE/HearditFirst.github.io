    <h2>International Trade</h2>
<p>India and the European Union announced a major trade agreement described as the "mother of all trade deals." This long-anticipated pact comes as both India and the EU face increasing economic and geopolitical challenges, particularly pressure from the United States. The deal is expected to strengthen economic ties and cooperation between Delhi and Brussels, potentially shifting trade dynamics on the global stage.</p>
<h2>Immigration and Legal Status</h2>
<p>Spain is set to offer legal status to around half a million undocumented migrants. The initiative will apply to foreign nationals without criminal records who can prove continuous residence in Spain for five months before December 31, 2025. This move aims to regularize the status of many migrants currently living in the country, reflecting ongoing debates about immigration policies in Europe. Meanwhile, the US announced it will send agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, but clarified that these agents will not have an immigration enforcement role, a decision that has sparked criticism from Italian officials.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>In Australia’s Victoria state, firefighters are actively battling at least six major wildfires amid a record-breaking heatwave. The blazes have reached an "emergency level," highlighting the ongoing challenges posed by extreme weather and climate conditions in the region. The situation underscores the strain on emergency services and the risks to communities in fire-prone areas.</p>
<h2>Social and Legal Changes</h2>
<p>Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 13 in response to concerns about gangs recruiting younger children. Critics argue the proposal risks pushing even younger children into the criminal system and could conflict with children’s rights protections. The debate reflects wider social worries about youth involvement in crime and how best to address it through law and policy.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media</h2>
<p>In California, authorities have launched a probe into TikTok over allegations that the platform censors content critical of former US President Donald Trump. Thousands of users claim political posts are being suppressed. This investigation follows a recent deal for TikTok to spin off its US operations, fueling ongoing questions about content moderation and political influence on social media.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The political thriller "One Battle After Another" leads the nominations for the upcoming Bafta awards with 14 nods. Other notable nominees include "Sinners," "Hamnet," and "Marty Supreme." The nominations highlight strong storytelling and production values in recent film and television works, drawing attention to political themes and historical drama in popular culture.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These developments touch on key issues such as international trade, immigration policy, climate challenges, social justice, digital media regulation, and cultural achievements, all of which shape current global conversations.</p>
