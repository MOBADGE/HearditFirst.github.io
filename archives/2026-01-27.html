    <h2>International Trade Developments</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a long-awaited trade deal amid rising economic and geopolitical challenges posed by the United States. This agreement marks a significant step in strengthening economic ties between Delhi and Brussels as both seek to diversify their partnerships in global markets.</p>
<p>In a separate move affecting international trade, the US has increased tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25%. The decision reflects concerns from the US side that South Korea is not fulfilling aspects of a trade deal made last year, potentially impacting economic relations and trade flows between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Severe Weather Events and Emergency Responses</h2>
<p>A deadly winter storm across several US states has caused at least a dozen deaths, widespread flight delays, and power outages affecting thousands of people. This severe weather event highlights ongoing challenges in managing infrastructure and public safety during extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Australia is experiencing a record-breaking heatwave, with firefighters in Victoria battling at least six major wildfires considered to be at an emergency level. The heatwave and resulting blazes underscore increasing risks related to climate extremes and fire management.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal News</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court judges have ruled that former Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte is fit to face proceedings related to alleged crimes of humanity during his controversial war on drugs, which resulted in thousands of deaths. This decision could lead to a high-profile international legal process.</p>
<p>In Japan, a court ordered compensation for migrants who were lured to North Korea with promises of an ideal life described as a "paradise on Earth." This ruling addresses past grievances of individuals misled about conditions in North Korea.</p>
<h2>Health and Safety Measures</h2>
<p>An outbreak of the Nipah virus in India’s West Bengal has prompted airports in Thailand and Nepal to begin screening passengers arriving from the region. Authorities are taking precautions to prevent the virus's spread across Asia after the outbreak was identified.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Media Regulation</h2>
<p>French MPs passed a bill aimed at banning access to social media platforms for children under the age of 15. If approved by the upper house, the law could come into effect by the start of France's new school year in September. The legislation is seen as a major step in regulating children's exposure to social media.</p>
<p>In addition, Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, plans to trial premium subscription services. While the core services will remain free, these subscriptions could offer additional features to users willing to pay, reflecting a shift in social media business models.</p>
