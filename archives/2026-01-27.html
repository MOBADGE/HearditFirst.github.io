    <h2>Global Trade Developments</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced what they describe as the "mother of all trade deals." This significant agreement comes at a time when both parties are managing economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States. The deal is expected to strengthen trade ties between India and the EU, potentially reshaping economic relations in the region and offering a counterbalance to US influence.</p>
<p>In contrast, the US has recently raised tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25%, with President Trump criticizing Seoul for not fully adhering to a trade agreement made last year. This move may lead to increased tensions in US-South Korea trade relations and could have broader implications for global trade dynamics.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal News</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, former President Rodrigo Duterte has been deemed fit to face proceedings at the International Criminal Court. The charges involve alleged crimes against humanity linked to his controversial war on drugs, which resulted in thousands of deaths. The ICC's decision allows these proceedings to move forward, marking a notable moment in international legal efforts related to political figures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Japan, a court has ordered compensation for migrants who were lured to North Korea under false promises. Plaintiffs stated they were deceived into believing North Korea was a "paradise on Earth." This ruling highlights ongoing concerns about human rights and the treatment of migrants in the region.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Technology</h2>
<p>France's lower house of parliament has approved a bill to ban social media use by children under the age of 15. If the bill passes the upper house, it could take effect by September, coinciding with the start of the new school year. The legislation aims to protect young people from potential harms associated with social media platforms.</p>
<p>In a related technological development, Meta is planning to trial premium subscription services for its core platforms—Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. While the main services will remain free, these subscriptions could offer additional features, signaling a shift in how social media companies generate revenue.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Health Concerns</h2>
<p>Australia is currently facing an intense heatwave, with firefighters in Victoria battling at least six major fires classified as emergency level blazes. The situation poses risks to communities and highlights the ongoing challenges of managing natural disasters during extreme weather events.</p>
<p>In the United States, a deadly winter storm has resulted in flight delays and left thousands without power across multiple states. Officials have reported at least a dozen deaths potentially linked to the storm, underscoring the severe impact of extreme weather conditions on infrastructure and public safety.</p>
<h2>Health Screening Measures</h2>
<p>A recent outbreak of the Nipah virus in India's West Bengal state has prompted airports in Thailand and Nepal to begin screening passengers arriving from the region. This precautionary measure comes as health authorities monitor the situation closely to prevent the virus from spreading beyond India’s borders.</p>
