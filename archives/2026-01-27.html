    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Events and Security</h2>
<p>The United States has announced it will send Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, Italy. However, the US agency clarified that its officers will not be involved in immigration enforcement during the games. This decision has caused some displeasure in Italy, fueling concerns over foreign security presence at the event.</p>
<h2>Protests and Human Rights in Iran</h2>
<p>Young protesters in Iran have shared their firsthand experiences with the crackdown that occurred earlier this month. Many described witnessing friends and others being killed as security forces moved to suppress demonstrations. These accounts highlight the ongoing tensions and the severe consequences faced by those involved in the protests.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Updates in Europe</h2>
<p>In France, Joel Guerriau, a former senator, has been found guilty of drugging a member of parliament. He was sentenced to four years in prison, with 18 months to be served behind bars. Meanwhile, Spain is preparing to regularize the status of around half a million undocumented migrants. The pathway to legal residency will be available to those without a criminal record who can prove residency in Spain for at least five months before the end of 2025.</p>
<h2>Trade and Economic Relations</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a major new trade agreement, described as the "mother of all trade deals." This deal emerges amid growing economic and geopolitical challenges posed by the United States, signaling deeper cooperation between New Delhi and Brussels as they seek to strengthen their economic ties.</p>
<h2>Environmental Challenges in Australia</h2>
<p>Firefighters in the Australian state of Victoria are contending with at least six major fires amid an ongoing heatwave that has broken temperature records. The severity of the blazes has been classified at an "emergency level," underscoring the critical situation and the ongoing threat posed by extreme weather conditions.</p>
<h2>Social and Legal Developments in Sweden and Canada</h2>
<p>Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility from its current level to 13 years old in response to concerns about children being recruited by gangs. This proposal has drawn criticism over potential impacts on children's rights and the possibility of younger children entering the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Carney spoke with US President Donald Trump following Trump’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods. Carney denied claims that he backtracked on statements made during a recent Davos speech during their phone conversation, highlighting ongoing tensions in US-Canada trade relations.</p>
