    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics and Security</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned a deadly Russian drone strike that targeted a packed passenger train in the country's northeast. Officials report at least four people were killed in the attack, highlighting ongoing tensions and violence in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, Tom Homan, known as the "border tsar" and a staunch defender of President Donald Trump's immigration policies, has been deployed to Minneapolis. Details about his specific role there have not been outlined, but his history suggests a focus on immigration enforcement.</p>
<h2>Migration and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Spain has announced plans to grant legal status to half a million undocumented migrants. This pathway will be open to foreign nationals without criminal records who can prove residence in Spain for at least five months before the end of 2025. The move aims to regularize a significant portion of the country's undocumented population.</p>
<p>In Italy, the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at the upcoming Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina has caused discontent. The U.S. agency stated it will not perform immigration duties during the event, despite being deployed to the games, a decision that has prompted criticism from Italian officials.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, families of victims killed in a fatal boat collision off the coast are pursuing legal action against the U.S. The incident occurred on October 14 and claimed six lives, including those of Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, who were returning home when their vessel was struck.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings in France</h2>
<p>Former French senator Joel Guerriau was found guilty of drugging a member of parliament. He received a four-year prison sentence, with 18 months to be served behind bars. The case has drawn attention due to the involvement of a former political figure in such serious charges.</p>
<h2>Trade and Economy</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced what has been described as the "mother of all trade deals." This long-awaited agreement comes at a time when both Delhi and Brussels are facing economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States. The deal is expected to have significant implications for trade relations and geopolitical alignments in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Environment and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Australian firefighters in Victoria are contending with at least six major blazes amid a record-breaking heatwave. The fires have reached an "emergency level," underscoring the ongoing challenges posed by extreme weather in the region.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Youth Policy</h2>
<p>Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 13 in response to concerns about gang recruitment involving children. However, the proposal has drawn criticism from those who worry it could criminalize even younger children and violate children's rights.</p>
<h2>Cultural Trends</h2>
<p>In China, "crying horse" toys have gone viral ahead of the Lunar New Year. Originally created by mistake, these frowning toys have resonated with young workers, becoming a popular and unexpected cultural phenomenon.</p>
