    <h2>International Trade Deal</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced what they describe as the "mother of all trade deals." This agreement comes amid economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States. The deal aims to strengthen trade ties between Delhi and Brussels, potentially reshaping some global trade dynamics. Both sides appear to be positioning themselves for greater economic cooperation as they manage shifting influences in international affairs.</p>
<h2>U.S. and Immigration Policy Developments</h2>
<p>The United States is sending Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, but the agency clarified it will not have an active immigration role during the event. This decision has sparked anger in Italy, reflecting tensions over U.S. immigration policy abroad.</p>
<p>In a related development, Tom Homan, a key figure in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, is being reassigned to Minneapolis. This move seems to signal a change in tone from the White House, although details on the implications of this reassignment are still unfolding.</p>
<h2>Sweden Proposes Lowering Age of Criminal Responsibility</h2>
<p>Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility from its current level down to 13 years old. The government aims to address concerns about gang recruitment of children. However, critics worry the change could result in younger children facing criminal charges and argue it may violate children's rights. This proposal highlights ongoing debates about youth crime and social policy in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Severe Weather Impacts in the U.S. and Australia</h2>
<p>A deadly winter storm has hit multiple U.S. states, causing at least a dozen deaths and widespread disruption. Flights have been delayed, and thousands of people are without power. Officials are continuing to respond to the emergency as the cold weather persists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Australia is confronting a record-breaking heatwave, particularly in Victoria, where firefighters are battling six major blazes classified at the emergency level. The heat and fires pose significant challenges for safety and environmental management in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Global News</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has ruled that former Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte is fit to face proceedings related to accusations of crimes against humanity during his anti-drug campaign, which led to thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>In Japan, a court ordered compensation for migrants who were allegedly misled into moving to North Korea under false promises of an ideal life, described by plaintiffs as being marketed as "paradise on Earth."</p>
<p>Finally, airports in Thailand and Nepal have begun screening passengers arriving from West Bengal, India, due to an outbreak of the Nipah virus. This precautionary step reflects wider concerns about controlling the spread of infectious diseases during global travel.</p>
