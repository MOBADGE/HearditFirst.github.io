    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a major trade agreement, described as the "mother of all trade deals." This long-awaited pact comes at a time when both Delhi and Brussels face increasing economic and geopolitical pressures from the US. The deal aims to strengthen economic ties and could influence global trade dynamics.</p>
<p>In North America, tensions surfaced after US President Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada. The Canadian prime minister, Carney, denied walking back his remarks from the World Economic Forum in Davos during a phone call with Trump, confirming that they discussed the threat of tariffs.</p>
<h2>Migration and Legal Changes</h2>
<p>Spain is preparing legislation to grant legal status to approximately half a million undocumented migrants. This new process targets foreign nationals who have no criminal record and can prove they lived in Spain for five months before December 31, 2025. This move could significantly impact the lives of many migrants and influence the country’s labor market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ahead of the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, the US immigration agency ICE announced it will not be involved in immigration enforcement at the event. This decision has caused some upset in Italy, reflecting concerns over the role of foreign agencies at international sporting events.</p>
<h2>Social Unrest and Human Rights</h2>
<p>In Iran, young protesters have spoken out about the brutal crackdown on demonstrations earlier this month. Many expressed the trauma of witnessing friends and acquaintances killed by security forces, highlighting the ongoing tensions and the harsh response to public dissent.</p>
<p>Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 13 due to concerns about gangs recruiting children. The proposal has faced criticism from those worried it could criminalize very young children and violate their rights, raising questions about juvenile justice policy.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings and Justice</h2>
<p>In France, Joel Guerriau, a former senator, has been found guilty of drugging a member of parliament. He received a four-year prison sentence, with 18 months to be served behind bars. This case underscores issues of misconduct within political circles.</p>
<p>In the Caribbean, families of six men killed when a boat was struck off the coast of Venezuela are suing the US. The victims, including Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, were Trinidadian nationals returning home at the time of the incident on October 14. The lawsuit seeks accountability for the deadly accident.</p>
<h2>Environment and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Australia is facing a severe heatwave, with firefighters in Victoria battling at least six major fires described as being at "emergency level." The record-breaking heat has intensified fire risk, posing significant challenges for emergency services and residents in affected areas.</p>
<h2>Cultural Notes</h2>
<p>In China, "crying horse" toys have gone viral just before the Lunar New Year. These frowning toys, originally created by mistake, have struck a chord particularly with young workers. Their popularity reflects a cultural moment that resonates with feelings among younger generations.</p>
