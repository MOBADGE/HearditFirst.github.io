    <h2>US Immigration Leadership Change in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, known for his role in the US immigration crackdown, is set to leave Minneapolis. This move signals a shift in approach from the White House regarding immigration enforcement in the city. Homan has been a prominent figure in efforts to tighten border controls, and his reassignment may lead to changes in local immigration policies or priorities.</p>
<h2>India and EU Reach Significant Trade Agreement</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a landmark trade deal. This development comes as both parties navigate economic and geopolitical challenges, particularly related to pressure from the United States. The agreement is expected to enhance trade relations and economic cooperation between Delhi and Brussels, potentially impacting markets and diplomatic ties in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings for Philippines' Duterte at International Criminal Court</h2>
<p>Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have ruled that Rodrigo Duterte, the 80-year-old former leader of the Philippines, is fit to participate in ICC proceedings. Duterte faces accusations of crimes against humanity connected to his brutal war on drugs, which reportedly resulted in thousands of deaths. This decision paves the way for further legal examination of his actions during his time in office.</p>
<h2>Japan Court Orders Compensation for People Lured to North Korea</h2>
<p>A Japanese court has mandated compensation for migrants who were enticed to relocate to North Korea under false pretenses. The plaintiffs argued that North Korea was promoted to them as a "paradise on Earth," which led to their decision to move. This ruling highlights ongoing concerns about coercive migration practices and the experiences of those who moved under misleading conditions.</p>
<h2>Heatwave Sparks Emergency Fires in Australia</h2>
<p>Firefighters in Victoria, Australia, are responding to at least six major blazes amid a record-breaking heatwave. The situation has been declared an "emergency level," underscoring the severity of the fires. This intense heat and fire activity pose risks to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems, with ongoing firefighting efforts aiming to contain the damage.</p>
<h2>Health Authorities Respond to Nipah Virus Outbreak in India</h2>
<p>Following an outbreak of the Nipah virus in India's West Bengal region, airports in Thailand and Nepal have begun screening passengers arriving from the area. This measure is part of precautions to prevent the spread of the virus beyond India and protect public health in neighboring countries. Monitoring and response efforts continue as health officials track the situation.</p>
