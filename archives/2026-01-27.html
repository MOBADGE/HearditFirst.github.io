    <h2>Immigration and Border Security</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, known for his strong support of former US President Donald Trump's immigration policies, has been deployed to Minneapolis in a role referred to as "border tsar." His presence signals a continued focus by US authorities on immigration enforcement and control amid ongoing policy debates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spain announced plans to grant legal status to around half a million undocumented migrants. Those eligible must have no criminal record and must prove they lived in Spain for at least five months before the end of 2025. This initiative aims to integrate long-term undocumented residents into Spanish society.</p>
<p>In related news, the US federal agency ICE stated that it will not have an immigration enforcement role during the upcoming Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina, Italy. This decision counters initial concerns from Italian officials who expressed unease over ICE agents' potential involvement at the international sporting event.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In France, former senator Joel Guerriau was found guilty of drugging a member of parliament. He received a prison sentence of four years, with 18 months required to be spent in jail. The conviction underscores ongoing legal accountability efforts involving public officials.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukraine faced a deadly drone strike targeting a crowded passenger train in the country's northeast. The attack killed at least four people and drew condemnation from Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. The incident highlights the ongoing violence and humanitarian challenges in the conflict with Russia.</p>
<h2>International Trade</h2>
<p>India and the European Union announced what they described as the "mother of all trade deals." This long-anticipated agreement comes amid growing economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States. The deal may reshape commercial relations between the two regions and impact global trade dynamics.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Trends</h2>
<p>A unique toy known as the "crying horse" has become popular in China ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations. Originally created by mistake, these frowning horse toys have struck a chord with young workers, reflecting current social moods and consumer trends.</p>
<h2>Environment and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Australia's state of Victoria is experiencing a severe heatwave accompanied by at least six major fires. Firefighters are working to control these "emergency level" blazes, which present significant challenges amid record-breaking temperatures.</p>
<h2>Crime and Youth Policy</h2>
<p>Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 13 years old in response to concerns about gangs recruiting children. However, critics warn this move could lead to even younger children entering the criminal justice system and may violate children's rights. The debate continues over the best approach to prevent youth involvement in crime while protecting minors' welfare.</p>
