    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Events and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The United States plans to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, Italy. However, the agency has clarified it will not have an immigration enforcement role during the event. This move has stirred some displeasure in Italy, reflecting ongoing sensitivities regarding foreign law enforcement activities on Italian soil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India and the European Union have announced what has been described as the "mother of all trade deals." This significant trade agreement comes as both Delhi and Brussels face increasing economic and geopolitical pressures, notably from the United States. The deal may reshape trade relations and influence global economic patterns.</p>
<p>Rwanda has taken legal action against the United Kingdom over the cancellation of a migrant deal. Rwanda claims it is owed payments related to the now-axed agreement. In response, the UK government has stated it will contest the case, underscoring ongoing tensions over migration policies.</p>
<h2>Migration Policy Developments</h2>
<p>Spain is set to grant legal status to around half a million undocumented migrants. Eligibility will require foreigners to have no criminal record and to prove residency in Spain for at least five months before the end of 2025. This policy aims to address the status of many migrants living in the country and may impact social and economic integration.</p>
<h2>Security and Social Issues</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have drawn international attention following a brutal crackdown by security forces earlier this month. Young Iranians have shared accounts of witnessing friends and others killed during these events, highlighting the severe impact on civilians and the continuing unrest.</p>
<p>In Sweden, a proposal to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 13 has sparked debate. The change aims to address concerns about gang recruitment of children. Critics warn the measure could criminalize even younger children and raise human rights issues relating to childhood and justice.</p>
<h2>Environment and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Australia faces an emergency situation as firefighters in Victoria battle at least six major blazes amid a record-breaking heatwave. These intense fires are straining resources and pose significant risks to communities and the environment in the region.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Media</h2>
<p>TikTok’s US operations have denied claims that they censor political content. Despite these assurances, thousands of users have alleged suppression of certain political topics following the platform’s spin-off as a US-based operation. This controversy sheds light on ongoing debates about content moderation and freedom of expression on social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Culture and Trends</h2>
<p>In China, "crying horse" toys have gone viral ahead of the Lunar New Year. Originally created by mistake, these frowning toys resonate with many young workers, reflecting a mix of humor and the emotional atmosphere among the younger generation during this cultural season.</p>
