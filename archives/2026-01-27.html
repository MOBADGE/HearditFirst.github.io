    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Diplomatic Developments</h2>
<p>The United States has announced it will deploy agents from its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. However, the agency clarified it will not be involved in immigration enforcement during the event. The plan has caused some tension with Italy, the host country, which expressed displeasure at the involvement of US federal agents.</p>
<p>In a diplomatic dispute, Rwanda has initiated legal action against the United Kingdom over a terminated agreement concerning migrant resettlement. Rwanda claims it is owed payments under the deal, while UK officials have stated they intend to contest the legal challenge. This disagreement highlights ongoing tensions around international migration policies.</p>
<h2>Protests and Human Rights in Iran</h2>
<p>Young people in Iran have shared harrowing accounts with the BBC of witnessing friends and acquaintances killed during a recent government crackdown on protests. The security forces’ actions have been described as brutal, with many victims known personally to those protesting. This situation underscores the severe repression faced by demonstrators and raises concerns about human rights violations amid ongoing unrest.</p>
<h2>Migration Policy Changes in Spain and Sweden</h2>
<p>Spain is planning to grant legal status to around half a million undocumented migrants. The policy will apply to foreign nationals without criminal records who can demonstrate residency in the country for at least five months before the end of 2025. This move aims to regularize a sizable portion of the migrant population.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 13 years old in response to concerns over gang recruitment of children. The proposal has faced criticism for potentially criminalizing even younger children and for possibly violating children's rights, reflecting a broader debate about how to address youth involvement in crime.</p>
<h2>Economic and Trade News</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a significant and long-anticipated trade agreement, which some are calling the "mother of all trade deals." Both India and the EU face mounting economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States, making this partnership particularly strategic as they work to strengthen ties and economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with US President Donald Trump following threats from Trump to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods. Trudeau denied that he had walked back any part of a speech made at the World Economic Forum in Davos during the phone call, illustrating ongoing trade tensions between the two North American neighbors.</p>
<h2>Environment and Culture</h2>
<p>Australia is experiencing a record-breaking heatwave in the state of Victoria, where firefighters are battling six major wildfires that have reached emergency status. The extreme weather and resulting fires pose significant risks to communities and the environment in the region.</p>
<p>In lighter news from China, "crying horse" toys have unexpectedly become popular ahead of the Lunar New Year. These frowning toys, initially produced by mistake, have struck a chord particularly with young workers, indicating a cultural moment of empathy or shared sentiment during the holiday season.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media</h2>
<p>TikTok’s US operation is facing criticism amid claims that political content is being censored. Thousands of users have alleged suppression of certain viewpoints following the platform’s spin-off from its parent company. TikTok US has pushed back against these accusations, contributing to ongoing debates about content moderation and free expression on social media platforms.</p>
