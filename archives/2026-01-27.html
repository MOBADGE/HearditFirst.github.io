    <h2>U.S. Immigration and Minneapolis Update</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, a key figure in the U.S. immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump, is set to leave Minneapolis. The White House appears to be shifting its approach, as it sends Homan, often called a "border tsar," to the city. This move indicates possible changes in immigration enforcement and local federal engagement, though specific future plans have not been detailed.</p>
<h2>India and EU Reach Trade Agreement</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a long-anticipated trade deal. This agreement comes amid growing economic and geopolitical challenges posed by the United States, leading both Delhi and Brussels to seek stronger ties. The deal aims to boost trade and strengthen cooperation, though details on its provisions and implementation remain forthcoming.</p>
<h2>Philippines' Duterte to Face ICC Proceedings</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court judges have concluded that Rodrigo Duterte, the former leader of the Philippines, is fit to stand trial. He faces accusations related to crimes against humanity linked to his administration's war on drugs, which reportedly resulted in thousands of deaths. The decision marks a significant step in the ongoing international scrutiny of Duterte's policies.</p>
<h2>Japan Orders Compensation for Migrants to North Korea</h2>
<p>A Japanese court has ruled that compensation must be paid to migrants who were persuaded to move to North Korea under false promises. The plaintiffs claimed they were led to believe North Korea was a “paradise on Earth.” This ruling addresses the longstanding grievances of those who were misled, though details on the sums involved have not been disclosed.</p>
<h2>Australia Battles Major Fires Amid Heatwave</h2>
<p>In Victoria, Australia, firefighters continue to combat at least six major fires during an unprecedented heatwave. The fires have been classified at an emergency level, signaling extreme risk and widespread impact. Authorities remain vigilant as temperatures remain high and conditions favor the spread of wildfires.</p>
<h2>Health Precautions as Nipah Virus Outbreak Spreads</h2>
<p>Following an outbreak of the Nipah virus in West Bengal, India, airports in Thailand and Nepal have started to screen passengers arriving from the region. This public health measure aims to contain the virus's spread amidst concerns over its severity. International monitoring and containment efforts are ongoing as health agencies respond to the situation.</p>
<h2>Additional Developments</h2>
<p>- Former U.S. President Donald Trump has increased tariffs on South Korean imports to 25%, citing Seoul's failure to meet terms of a 2025 trade deal.
- French lawmakers have voted in favor of a bill to ban social media use for children under 15, with potential implementation by September.
- Meta platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, plan to introduce premium subscription options while keeping their basic services free.
- A nurse named Alex Pretti, remembered as an outdoor enthusiast and mountain biking fan, was fatally shot in Minneapolis, sparking local attention and condolences.</p>
