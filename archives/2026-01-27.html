    <h2>US Immigration Changes in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>The immigration chief in Minneapolis is leaving as the administration appoints Tom Homan, known as a border tsar, to manage immigration issues on site. This change may indicate a shift away from the previous approach of strict immigration enforcement. The impact on the local community and immigration policy remains to be seen as this new leadership takes effect.</p>
<h2>US-South Korea Trade Tensions Rise</h2>
<p>The United States has increased tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25%. This move comes after accusations that South Korea failed to meet the terms of a trade deal struck last year. The higher tariffs could affect trade relations between the two countries and may lead to further negotiations or retaliatory measures.</p>
<h2>Japan Court Orders Compensation for North Korea Migrants</h2>
<p>A Japanese court has ordered compensation for a group of migrants who were enticed to move to North Korea under false promises. The migrants were told North Korea was a "paradise on Earth," a representation later proven to be misleading. This ruling recognizes their hardship and raises attention to the plight of those misled by propaganda.</p>
<h2>Social Media Giants Face Legal Challenges</h2>
<p>Leading technology companies including Meta (which owns Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp), ByteDance (owner of TikTok), and Google (YouTube’s parent company) are facing a landmark trial over claims that their platforms contribute to social media addiction. The court case could have significant implications for how social media companies design their products and protect users.</p>
<h2>Meta Trials Premium Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Meta is planning to introduce premium subscriptions for Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. While the basic services will remain free, users may have the option to pay for enhanced features. This marks a shift in revenue strategy for these platforms, potentially offering new ways to fund their operations beyond advertising.</p>
<h2>France Moves to Restrict Social Media Use for Under-15s</h2>
<p>French lawmakers have voted in favor of a bill that would ban children under 15 from using social media. If approved by the upper house, the law could take effect at the start of the school year in September. This legislation aims to protect younger users from potential harms associated with social media use.</p>
