    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The United States has announced it will send Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. However, the US agency clarified that it will not take on an immigration role during the event. This plan has sparked anger in Italy, which is hosting the global sporting event. Meanwhile, Rwanda has initiated legal proceedings against the United Kingdom, claiming it is owed payments related to a previously agreed migrant deal that the UK has since canceled. Downing Street has stated that it will defend its position in court.</p>
<h2>Protests and Rights Issues</h2>
<p>In Iran, young protesters have shared their experiences with the BBC, recounting how they witnessed friends and acquaintances killed during a recent government crackdown on demonstrations. The accounts highlight the severity of the repression faced by those participating in the protests. Meanwhile, Sweden is considering a proposal to lower the age of criminal responsibility from the current limit to 13 years old. The measure aims to address concerns about child recruitment by criminal gangs but has drawn criticism for potentially criminalizing younger children and infringing on children’s rights.</p>
<h2>Economic and Trade Developments</h2>
<p>Spain is set to legalize the status of around half a million undocumented migrants. The process will be open to foreign nationals without criminal records who can prove they lived in Spain for at least five months before December 31, 2025. In another major economic development, India and the European Union have announced a significant new trade agreement, described as the "mother of all trade deals." This deal comes amid growing economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States, signaling a strengthening of ties between Delhi and Brussels.</p>
<h2>Environment and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Australia is facing emergency-level wildfire conditions amid a record-breaking heatwave in the state of Victoria. Firefighters are currently battling at least six large fires, working to contain the blazes as extreme heat continues to strain resources and heighten risks for communities in the region.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Trends</h2>
<p>In China, "crying horse" toys have unexpectedly gone viral ahead of the Lunar New Year. These frowning horse figurines were originally produced by mistake but have struck a chord with young workers who identify with their anxious expressions. Meanwhile, TikTok’s US operations are under scrutiny from thousands of users who claim the platform is censoring political content. TikTok US has pushed back against these allegations, denying that it suppresses political expression following its separation from the overseas operation.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Communications</h2>
<p>In North America, Canadian Prime Minister Carney has denied reports that he walked back remarks made in a speech at the Davos economic forum. This came after a phone call between Carney and US President Trump, who had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods. The call indicates ongoing tension between the two countries on trade and economic issues, but the Canadian leader maintains his stance from the speech.</p>
