    <h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a major trade agreement described as the "mother of all trade deals." The pact aims to strengthen economic ties amid pressure both from the United States and shifting global geopolitical dynamics. This deal marks a significant milestone for India and the EU as they navigate a complex international trade environment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions between the US and South Korea have escalated after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on South Korean imports to 25%. Trump criticized South Korea for reportedly not fulfilling the terms of a trade agreement made last year, increasing strain on US-Asian trade relations.</p>
<h2>Security and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court judges have ruled that the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte is fit to face proceedings concerning allegations of crimes against humanity. These charges stem from his controversial war on drugs, which resulted in thousands of deaths. This ruling moves the case forward in international law and highlights ongoing debates about accountability.</p>
<p>In Japan, a court has ordered compensation for migrants who were deceived into moving to North Korea. Plaintiffs said they were led to believe North Korea was a "paradise on Earth," shedding light on longstanding issues related to forced migration and human rights.</p>
<p>The US federal agency ICE will send agents to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy; however, it clarified it will not perform immigration enforcement at the event. The planned deployment has sparked criticism and anger from Italian officials concerned about sovereignty and security arrangements during the games.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Health</h2>
<p>A severe winter storm in the United States has caused widespread disruption, leading to thousands losing power and numerous flight delays. Officials have reported at least a dozen deaths across several states potentially linked to the storm, underscoring the ongoing risks of extreme weather during winter months.</p>
<p>In Australia’s state of Victoria, firefighters continue to battle six major bushfires amid a record-breaking heatwave. Authorities have declared the fires at an emergency level, raising concerns about the impact on communities and the environment during the peak of wildfire season.</p>
<p>In health news, an outbreak of the Nipah virus originating in India has prompted enhanced airport screenings in countries including Thailand and Nepal. These precautions focus on passengers arriving from West Bengal, aiming to prevent broader regional spread of the infectious disease.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Trends</h2>
<p>In China, a new trend has emerged where "crying horse" toys have gone viral just before the Lunar New Year. Originally produced by mistake, these frowning horse figures have resonated with younger workers, reflecting a mix of humor and the social atmosphere among the youth during a significant cultural celebration.</p>
<h2>Domestic Policy Proposals</h2>
<p>Sweden is considering a proposal to lower the age of criminal responsibility from the current level to 13 years old. This move is motivated by concerns over children being recruited into gangs. However, critics warn it could lead to even younger children facing criminal charges and could infringe on children's rights, sparking a national debate on juvenile justice.</p>
