    <h2>US Immigration Leadership Shift</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, known for his role in enforcing former president Trump's immigration policies, is being reassigned to Minneapolis. This move signals a shift in the White House's approach to immigration enforcement. Homan's reassignment comes amid ongoing discussions about the US border and immigration policies. The change may affect local enforcement dynamics in Minneapolis and suggests adjustments in federal immigration priorities.</p>
<h2>India and EU Finalize Trade Agreement</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a significant trade deal after prolonged negotiations. This agreement is important as both parties navigate economic and geopolitical challenges, including pressure from the United States. The deal aims to strengthen economic ties and may influence global trade patterns, particularly in response to shifting alliances and trade tensions.</p>
<h2>Philippines' Duterte to Face ICC Proceedings</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court has determined that Rodrigo Duterte, former president of the Philippines, is fit to stand trial. The case concerns allegations of crimes against humanity linked to his controversial war on drugs, which resulted in thousands of deaths. This ruling marks a key moment in international justice and may affect diplomatic relations with the Philippines.</p>
<h2>Major Fires Threaten Australia During Heatwave</h2>
<p>Firefighters in Victoria, Australia, are battling at least six major fires amid an unprecedented heatwave. The fires have been described as reaching "emergency level," presenting serious challenges for local communities and emergency responders. As severe heat persists, authorities continue firefighting efforts to control the blazes and protect lives and property.</p>
<h2>Asia Implements Airport Screenings Amid Virus Outbreak</h2>
<p>In response to a Nipah virus outbreak in West Bengal, India, airports in Thailand and Nepal have begun screening passengers arriving from the affected region. The screening aims to prevent the spread of the virus across borders. This health measure highlights concerns about emerging infectious diseases and the importance of surveillance in international travel.</p>
<h2>Changes on Social Platforms and Trade Tensions</h2>
<p>In Europe, French lawmakers have approved a bill that could ban social media use for children under 15 if it passes the upper house. The law may come into effect by September, aligning with the new school year, and represents an effort to regulate young people's access to social media for safety reasons.</p>
<p>At the same time, Meta platforms including Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp announced plans to trial premium subscription services. While core access remains free, these optional paid features provide new revenue streams and may alter user experiences.</p>
<p>On the trade front, the US has raised tariffs on South Korean imports to 25%, accusing South Korea of not meeting the terms of a previously agreed trade deal. This escalation could impact economic ties between the two countries and highlights ongoing trade negotiations.</p>
