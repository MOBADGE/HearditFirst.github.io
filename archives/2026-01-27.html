    <h2>US Immigration and Minneapolis Developments</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, known for his role in former President Trump's border crackdown, is expected to leave Minneapolis. His reassignment signals a shift in tone from the White House regarding its immigration priorities. The change comes amid local tensions and follows the recent shooting of Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse in Minneapolis, who was remembered as an avid mountain biker and outdoorsman. The developments highlight ongoing challenges in the city relating to public safety and immigration enforcement.</p>
<h2>International Trade Moves</h2>
<p>India and the European Union are close to announcing a landmark trade deal. The agreement comes at a time when both India and the EU face economic and geopolitical pressures from the United States. Meanwhile, Trump has raised US tariffs on South Korean imports to 25%, accusing South Korea of failing to meet the terms of a trade deal reached the previous year. These shifts in trade policy indicate changing dynamics and tensions in global economic relations.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Technology Regulation</h2>
<p>France’s lower house of parliament has voted in favor of a bill that would ban social media use for children under 15. If the bill passes the upper house, it could take effect by the start of the new school year in September, representing a significant move toward regulating young people's online access.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, major tech companies including Meta (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp), ByteDance (TikTok), and Google (YouTube) are facing a landmark trial over claims their platforms contribute to social media addiction. In response to changing demands, Meta plans to trial premium subscription options for its core platforms, while keeping basic services free. This trial reflects ongoing efforts to balance user engagement, revenue, and regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Asia-Pacific Legal and Industrial Developments</h2>
<p>A Japanese court has ordered compensation for migrants who were enticed to North Korea with promises of a "paradise on Earth." The ruling acknowledges the hardships faced by those who moved under false pretenses.</p>
<p>In parallel, India is making substantial investments to grow its computer chip industry, betting hundreds of millions of dollars on this strategic sector. This push aims to establish India as a player in the highly competitive semiconductor market, a key element for future technological and economic growth.</p>
