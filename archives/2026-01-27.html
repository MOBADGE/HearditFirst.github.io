    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Trade Developments</h2>
<p>India and the European Union have announced a major trade agreement described as the "mother of all trade deals." This long-anticipated pact comes as both Delhi and Brussels face economic and geopolitical challenges, including pressure from the United States. The deal could reshape economic ties between Asia and Europe, addressing mutual concerns and opening new markets. Meanwhile, tensions persist in US trade relations, as former US President Donald Trump has raised tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25%, claiming that Seoul is not fulfilling a trade deal agreed upon last year. These moves highlight ongoing shifts and disputes in global trade dynamics.</p>
<h2>Security and Legal Actions</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) judges have determined that Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines is fit to face proceedings related to alleged crimes of humanity during his controversial war on drugs, which resulted in thousands of deaths. This decision allows the ICC to move forward with investigations into the allegations. Additionally, a Japanese court has ordered compensation for migrants who were deceived into going to North Korea with promises of it being a "paradise on Earth." These legal developments reflect the continuing international efforts to address human rights abuses and historical injustices.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Health Concerns</h2>
<p>A powerful winter storm in the United States has caused widespread disruption, killing at least twelve people across multiple states and leaving thousands without power. Travel and daily life have been significantly affected by flight delays and dangerous conditions. In Asia, a Nipah virus outbreak in India has prompted airport screenings in Thailand and Nepal, especially for passengers arriving from West Bengal. These health and safety challenges underscore the vulnerability of communities to natural disasters and infectious diseases.</p>
<h2>Social Policy in Sweden and Controversial Proposals</h2>
<p>Sweden is considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 13 in response to concerns about gangs recruiting children. Supporters argue this could help address juvenile crime more effectively, but critics warn that it risks criminalizing even younger children and violating children's rights. The debate raises important questions about balancing public safety and protecting youth, with potential implications for legal systems and social services across Europe.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Public Safety Challenges</h2>
<p>Australia is grappling with an intense heatwave driving multiple major fires, particularly in Victoria. Firefighters are working to contain six large blazes categorized at "emergency level," amid record-breaking high temperatures. These conditions highlight the continuing impact of climate change on fire risks and the need for preparedness and response strategies. At the same time, cultural trends are capturing public attention in China as "crying horse" toys, initially created by mistake, become unexpectedly popular among young workers ahead of the Lunar New Year, reflecting social moods in an unconventional way.</p>
<h2>US Involvement at Winter Olympics</h2>
<p>The US has announced it will send Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, though officials have stated these agents will not perform immigration duties during the event. The announcement has drawn criticism from Italy, signaling potential diplomatic sensitivity regarding security and cooperation at major international sporting events. The approach to security at the Olympics will remain a topic to watch as the event draws nearer.</p>
