    <h2>Ukraine's Ex-Energy Minister Detained</h2>
<p>Ukraine's former energy minister was detained while attempting to leave the country. His detention follows legal proceedings related to a corruption scandal that led to his dismissal. This development highlights ongoing efforts in Ukraine to tackle corruption within public office. The case may impact the broader political and anti-corruption climate in the country.</p>
<h2>New Evidence in Nancy Guthrie Case</h2>
<p>The FBI announced that DNA evidence recovered from a glove matches samples connected to the Nancy Guthrie case. The glove was found in a field near the side of a road just a few miles from Guthrie’s home. This discovery could play a key role in advancing the investigation and potentially identifying those responsible.</p>
<h2>Iran Signals Willingness to Negotiate Nuclear Deal</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, told the BBC that Iran is open to discussing compromises to finalize a nuclear agreement. However, he said the "ball was in America's court" to demonstrate a genuine desire to reach a deal. This statement suggests a cautious but hopeful stance towards renewed diplomatic efforts after years of stalled negotiations.</p>
<h2>Violence in Gaza and Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Gaza, Israeli strikes resulted in at least eleven deaths, including six people killed in a strike on a tent encampment in the north, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s Niger State experienced deadly motorbike raids where armed men killed dozens, burned homes, and abducted an unknown number of villagers. These incidents underscore ongoing security challenges and humanitarian concerns in both regions.</p>
<h2>UK Attributes Navalny’s Death to Poisoning</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office stated that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed by a toxin derived from a dart frog. Officials said there is no innocent explanation for the toxin’s presence in his body samples. This assertion adds to international scrutiny of Russia’s alleged actions against political opponents and may influence diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>International Developments and Protests</h2>
<p>Ghana has requested the extradition of a Russian man accused of secretly filming women during sexual encounters without their consent. In another development, the US boarded a tanker, Veronica III, in the Indian Ocean, accusing it of violating a Venezuelan oil shipment quarantine.</p>
<p>In global protests, hundreds of thousands took to the streets worldwide to demonstrate, including large gatherings in Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto, with smaller rallies in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. These protests reflect widespread public engagement on issues related to Iran.</p>
<p>Additionally, China announced it will ease visa restrictions for UK and Canadian passport holders starting February 17, enabling visa-free travel. This move may impact tourism and business travel between China and these countries.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Today's news highlights continued geopolitical tensions, security crises, and global civic activism, with diplomacy and justice processes unfolding in multiple regions.</p>
