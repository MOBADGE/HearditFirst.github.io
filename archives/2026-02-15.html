    <h2>Middle East Conflict</h2>
<p>At least 11 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to rescuers. The Palestinian Red Crescent said that a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza killed at least six individuals. These attacks add to ongoing tensions and violence in the region. The situation remains volatile with the potential for further escalation affecting civilians.</p>
<h2>Iran Nuclear Talks and Protests</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, stated in an interview with the BBC that Iran is ready to discuss compromises to revive the nuclear deal. He emphasized that the ball is “in America’s court” to demonstrate a willingness to make a deal. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people joined protests in support of Iran around the world. Large gatherings took place in cities like Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto, while smaller rallies happened in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. These developments reflect both diplomatic efforts and widespread public engagement internationally.</p>
<h2>Russia-related Incidents</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny by poisoning him with dart frog toxin, saying there is no innocent explanation for the presence of this toxin found in samples from his body. In a separate case, Ghana has called on Russia to extradite a man described as a "pick-up artist" who faces allegations of secretly filming women without their consent during sexual encounters. These cases contribute to ongoing concerns over Russia’s international actions and legal disputes.</p>
<h2>Violence in Nigeria</h2>
<p>Dozens of people were killed during armed motorbike raids on villages in Niger State, Nigeria. Attackers reportedly shot locals, set homes on fire, and abducted an unspecified number of individuals. The violent raids have caused significant fear and instability in the affected communities.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>In Europe, opposition politicians from the United States attended a summit in Munich aiming to reassure European allies. They presented themselves as an alternative to the "America First" policy and sought to establish credibility as future party leaders. Their message included a belief that President Donald Trump would be out of office within three years. This reflects ongoing political maneuvering and efforts to shape future US-European relations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China announced that starting February 17 it will allow visa-free travel for British and Canadian passport holders, signaling a relaxation of travel restrictions and potential boosts to tourism and business links between these countries.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>A multimillion-euro heist went unnoticed until after it happened, raising questions about how thieves knew exactly where a vault was located and why there was no audible sign of drilling. The investigation is considering if there was an inside job involved. This case highlights vulnerabilities in security systems, especially concerning high-value targets.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These updates cover key political, security, and social developments around the world today, with implications for international diplomacy, regional stability, and public safety.</p>
