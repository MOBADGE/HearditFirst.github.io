    <h2>International Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, stated in an interview that Iran is willing to discuss compromises to reach a new nuclear deal. He emphasized that the next step is up to the United States, saying it must show a genuine intent to finalize an agreement. This development follows ongoing international efforts to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities through diplomacy.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Israeli strikes have killed at least eleven people in Gaza, including six in a Palestinian tent encampment in the north of the territory, as reported by the Palestinian Red Crescent. The situation remains tense, reflecting ongoing conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Security Developments</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s former energy minister was detained while trying to leave the country amid legal proceedings tied to a corruption scandal. This arrest highlights continued efforts to address corruption within Ukraine.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, armed men conducted motorbike raids in Niger State, killing dozens of villagers, burning homes, and abducting an unspecified number of people. The attacks have heightened concerns over security in the region.</p>
<p>Russia faces an international accusation from the UK Foreign Office, which claims that opposition figure Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a toxin derived from a dart frog. Officials stated there was no innocent explanation for the presence of this toxin in Navalny’s body samples.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ghana has requested Russia to extradite a man accused of secretly filming women during sexual encounters in Ghana without their consent. The case has drawn attention to cross-border criminal issues.</p>
<h2>U.S. Law Enforcement and Investigations</h2>
<p>The FBI is examining a glove found near the home of a suspect in the Guthrie case. DNA samples recovered from the glove are helping authorities in their ongoing investigation, marking a step forward in forensic analysis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Attorney General has faced criticism from lawmakers over claims that all files related to Jeffrey Epstein’s case have been fully released. Some legislators, including those responsible for the law mandating the disclosure, argue that the released documents are incomplete.</p>
<p>The United States also boarded a second oil tanker, the Veronica III, in the Indian Ocean after monitoring its movements from the Caribbean. The U.S. accuses the vessel of violating a quarantine on Venezuelan oil shipments, reflecting ongoing enforcement of sanctions related to Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Global Protests and Public Response</h2>
<p>Protests inspired by events in Iran have attracted hundreds of thousands of participants worldwide. Major demonstrations took place in cities such as Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto, with smaller rallies reported in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. These gatherings demonstrate international solidarity and the global reach of concerns linked to Iran's domestic and foreign policies.</p>
