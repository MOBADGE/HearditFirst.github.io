    <h2>Middle East Tensions and Violence</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed eleven people, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. One of the deadliest attacks hit a tent encampment in northern Gaza, killing at least six. The violent escalation adds to ongoing conflict in the region, raising concerns about further civilian casualties and instability.</p>
<p>In addition, hundreds of thousands of people around the world participated in demonstrations in support of Iran. Large protests took place in cities like Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto, with smaller rallies also seen in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. The global nature of these protests shows widespread attention on Iran’s domestic and regional issues.</p>
<h2>Iran Nuclear Deal Talks</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, stated in an interview with the BBC that Iran is willing to discuss compromises aimed at reviving the nuclear deal. However, he emphasized that the "ball was in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal." This dialogue will be watched closely as the deal’s revival could impact regional security and international diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>Russia-Related Developments</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny using a toxin derived from dart frogs. Officials said there was no innocent explanation for the toxin being found in samples taken from Navalny’s body. This allegation adds to ongoing tensions between Russia and Western countries.</p>
<p>Separately, Ghana has called on Russia to extradite a man described as a "pick-up artist," who is accused of secretly filming women without their consent during sexual encounters. This case highlights issues of privacy and international law enforcement cooperation.</p>
<h2>Security and Violence in Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Nigeria’s Niger State, armed men conducted motorbike raids on several villages, killing dozens of people, setting homes on fire, and abducting an unspecified number of residents. This violence underscores ongoing insecurity challenges in the region and the threat to local communities.</p>
<h2>Travel and Diplomatic Updates</h2>
<p>China announced it will introduce visa-free travel for UK and Canadian nationals starting on 17 February. This policy change is designed to encourage tourism and business between these countries and China, potentially boosting international exchanges and economic ties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, opposition politicians in the United States gathered at a summit in Munich to present alternatives to the "America First" approach. They sought to reassure European partners and position themselves as future leaders, signaling ongoing political competition ahead of upcoming elections.</p>
