    <h2>Iran Nuclear Deal Discussions</h2>
<p>Iran has expressed a willingness to discuss compromises to revive its nuclear deal. Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, told the BBC that Iran is ready to negotiate but said the responsibility now lies with the United States to show it wants to make a deal. This statement signals a potential reopening of talks amid ongoing tensions over Iran's nuclear program. If the US responds positively, it could lead to progress in curbing nuclear proliferation in the region.</p>
<h2>UK Accuses Russia Over Navalny’s Death</h2>
<p>The UK government has accused Russia of killing opposition figure Alexei Navalny using a rare toxin derived from dart frogs. The British Foreign Office stated there is no innocent explanation for the presence of this toxin in samples taken from Navalny's body. This allegation heightens diplomatic tensions between Russia and Western countries, as it points to a deliberate attempt to silence a prominent critic of the Russian government.</p>
<h2>Violence in Nigeria’s Niger State</h2>
<p>At least 30 people have been killed in violent motorbike raids on villages in Nigeria’s Niger state. Attackers carried out shootings, throat-slitting, arson, and abductions in several communities. The scale and brutality of the assaults have caused alarm and raise concerns over the security situation in the region. The violence could destabilize local communities and complicate efforts by authorities to maintain order.</p>
<h2>US Political Figures Address Europe</h2>
<p>Leading Democrats have sought to reassure European allies about the future of US politics during a summit in Munich. They positioned themselves as alternatives to the "America First" approach championed in recent years and aimed to present a vision of renewed cooperation. This move reflects ongoing political contestation in the United States and an effort by opposition figures to restore transatlantic relations.</p>
<h2>US Abduction Case Draws National Attention</h2>
<p>The abduction of Nancy Guthrie has gained widespread public interest, partly due to the involvement of her daughter, Savannah Guthrie, a well-known television personality. The case, which also involves a demand for Bitcoin ransom, has captivated the nation. The high-profile nature of the incident underscores how media attention can influence public engagement with criminal investigations.</p>
<h2>Large-Scale Heist Shakes Confidence in Germany</h2>
<p>A multimillion-euro theft in Germany has recently come to light, revealing a major crime that went unnoticed for some time. The incident has caused concern among Germans about their trust in public institutions and the security of systems responsible for safeguarding valuables. The repercussions could prompt calls for increased oversight and reforms to prevent similar breaches in the future.</p>
