    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 15, 2026</div>
    <h2>Middle East Tensions and Conflicts</h2>
<p>Eleven people have died in Israeli strikes on Gaza, with the Palestinian Red Crescent reporting that at least six were killed in an attack on a tent encampment in northern Gaza. The violence adds to the ongoing tensions in the region. Meanwhile, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, stated in an interview with the BBC that Iran is willing to discuss compromises to revive the nuclear deal. However, he emphasized that the United States needs to demonstrate its willingness to make a deal, suggesting that progress depends on American actions.</p>
<h2>Global Protests for Iran</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in cities worldwide to protest in support of Iran. Large gatherings occurred in Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto, with smaller demonstrations reported in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. These protests signal broad international attention to issues related to Iran.</p>
<h2>Accusations Against Russia</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office has accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny using a toxin derived from dart frogs. Officials assert there is no innocent explanation for the presence of this toxin in Navalny’s body samples. Additionally, Ghana has requested Russia to extradite a man described as a Russian "pick-up artist" accused of secretly filming women during sexual encounters without their consent. The request highlights ongoing international legal and diplomatic tensions involving Russia.</p>
<h2>Violence in Nigeria</h2>
<p>Violent raids by armed assailants on villages in Nigeria's Niger state have resulted in dozens of deaths. Attackers reportedly used shootings and throat-cutting and set homes on fire. Multiple people were also abducted during these motorbike raids, raising concerns about security and humanitarian conditions in the region.</p>
<h2>International Travel and Security Headlines</h2>
<p>China announced that it will allow visa-free travel for UK and Canadian nationals, with the new rules taking effect on February 17. This move aims to ease travel restrictions and could strengthen tourism and business ties. In a separate security-related story, a multimillion-euro heist recently came to light, raising questions about how thieves pinpointed the vault’s location and operated undetected. Authorities are investigating whether the robbery involved inside information.</p>
<h2>U.S. Political Developments and Public Interest</h2>
<p>At a political summit in Munich, leading Democrats sought to reassure European partners by positioning themselves as alternatives to the current U.S. administration, with some predicting changes within the next three years. On a different note, the abduction of Nancy Guthrie has attracted nationwide attention in the U.S., partly due to the involvement of her daughter, television personality Savannah Guthrie, making the case a subject of public fascination and concern.</p>
