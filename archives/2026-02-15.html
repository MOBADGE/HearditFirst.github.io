    <h2>Global Diplomacy and Security</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said the country is ready to discuss compromises to revive the nuclear deal but emphasized that the ball is now "in America's court" to prove its willingness to make a deal. This statement underlines ongoing efforts to negotiate a resolution to tensions over Iran's nuclear program, with potential implications for regional security and global diplomacy.</p>
<p>In a separate development, the UK government has accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny by poisoning him with dart frog toxin. The UK Foreign Office stated there was no innocent explanation for the toxin found in Navalny's body. This allegation adds another layer of tension to already strained relations between Russia and Western countries.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Violence</h2>
<p>Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed at least eleven people, including six who died in a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The strikes contribute to ongoing violence in the region, raising concerns about civilian casualties and the potential for further escalations.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, armed men on motorbikes carried out raids on villages in Niger State, killing dozens, burning homes, and abducting an undetermined number of people. The attacks highlight ongoing security challenges in parts of Nigeria, affecting local communities and humanitarian conditions.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s former energy minister was detained while attempting to leave the country amid legal proceedings linked to a corruption scandal. His detention underscores ongoing investigations and political accountability efforts in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ghana has requested the extradition of a Russian man accused of secretly filming women without their consent during sexual encounters. Ghana’s call seeks to address allegations of privacy violations and sexual misconduct involving a foreign national.</p>
<h2>Protests and Public Movements</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people took part in protests supporting Iran in cities worldwide, including Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto. Smaller rallies were also held in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. These demonstrations reflect widespread international attention and solidarity on issues related to Iran.</p>
<h2>Travel and International Relations</h2>
<p>China announced that it will allow visa-free travel for British and Canadian nationals starting February 17. This move relaxes previous visa restrictions and may facilitate tourism, business, and people-to-people exchanges between China and these countries.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>A multimillion-euro heist, notable for its precision and secrecy, has raised questions about how the thieves knew exactly where the vault was and why no alarms were triggered. Suspicion falls on the possibility of inside involvement, but details remain limited.</p>
<p>In Munich, opposition politicians from the U.S. gathered to offer an alternative to the "America First" policy and to reassure European partners about future U.S. leadership. They conveyed confidence that a current political figure would "be gone in three years," signaling efforts to rebuild alliances and present new leadership options.</p>
