    <div class="date">February 15, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Eleven people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. One strike targeted a tent encampment in northern Gaza, killing at least six individuals. The incident reflects ongoing hostilities in the region with continuing impact on civilian populations.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, armed men conducted motorbike raids on villages in Niger State, killing dozens, setting homes on fire, and abducting an unspecified number of people. These attacks highlight ongoing insecurity and violence in parts of northern Nigeria, raising concerns about the safety of local communities.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s former energy minister was detained while attempting to leave the country. He faces legal proceedings related to a corruption scandal that led to his dismissal. His detention may influence ongoing anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In Ghana, authorities have called for the extradition of a Russian man accused of secretly filming women during sexual encounters without their consent. This case involves sensitive issues around privacy and international cooperation on criminal matters.</p>
<p>The UK government alleged that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a toxin derived from dart frogs. The Foreign Office stated there is no innocent explanation for the presence of the toxin in samples taken from Navalny's body, underscoring accusations of foul play against Russian authorities.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said Tehran is ready to discuss compromises to reach a nuclear deal. Speaking from Tehran, he noted that the "ball was in America's court," implying the United States must demonstrate willingness to conclude an agreement. This signals potential progress in negotiations that have long affected regional and global security.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement and Investigations</h2>
<p>The FBI is analyzing a glove recovered near the home of Guthrie, which appears to match gloves seen in a suspect video. The glove yielded a DNA sample that may be important to advancing the case. This is part of ongoing efforts to solve the investigation and bring clarity to the circumstances involved.</p>
<h2>Public Demonstrations and Social Movements</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people gathered worldwide to protest in support of movements originating in Iran. The largest crowds were reported in Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto, with smaller demonstrations in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. These protests illustrate widespread international solidarity with Iranian activists and ongoing debates about social and political issues in Iran.</p>
<h2>US Government and International Maritime Activity</h2>
<p>The US has boarded a second tanker, the Veronica III, in the Indian Ocean after tracking it from the Caribbean. US authorities accuse the vessel of violating a "quarantine" on oil shipments from Venezuela. This action is part of broader US enforcement related to sanctions and maritime regulations in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US Attorney General comments stating that all files related to Jeffrey Epstein have been released drew criticism from lawmakers. Those involved in passing the law requiring disclosure argue that the release was incomplete, highlighting concerns about transparency and accountability in high-profile investigations.</p>
