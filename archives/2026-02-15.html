    <h2>Iran Nuclear Deal Talks</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said that Iran is ready to discuss compromises to reach a nuclear deal. Speaking to the BBC from Tehran, he emphasized that the responsibility now lies with the United States to show a genuine willingness to make a deal. This statement suggests a potential opening for renewed diplomatic efforts after years of stalled negotiations. The outcome could affect regional stability and global non-proliferation efforts.</p>
<h2>Russia and Alexei Navalny Case</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office accused Russia of killing opposition figure Alexei Navalny using a toxin derived from the dart frog. Officials stated there is no innocent explanation for this toxin being found in samples taken from Navalny’s body. This development adds to ongoing international concerns over Navalny’s poisoning and Russia’s role in suppressing political dissent. The accusation may increase tensions between Russia and Western countries.</p>
<h2>Violence in Nigeria’s Niger State</h2>
<p>At least 30 people were killed in a series of brutal raids in villages across Niger state, Nigeria. Armed assailants attacked on motorbikes, shooting victims, cutting throats, setting homes on fire, and abducting multiple individuals. These attacks highlight the continued security challenges faced by communities in the region and raise urgent questions about the Nigerian government’s ability to prevent such violence.</p>
<h2>US Political Opposition Seeks to Reassure Europe</h2>
<p>Opposition politicians in the United States gathered at a summit in Munich to present themselves as an alternative to the “America First” approach. They aimed to reassure European allies and assert their vision for future leadership. During the event, top Democrats expressed confidence that the current political figure would be “gone in three years,” signaling their intent to change the course of US foreign and domestic policy. This meeting may influence how Europe and the US collaborate in coming years.</p>
<h2>High-Profile Abduction Grips US Public</h2>
<p>The case of Nancy Guthrie’s abduction has attracted widespread attention in the United States, partly because of her daughter Savannah Guthrie’s prominence as a television personality. The media focus has turned the personal tragedy into a national obsession, underscoring how public figures can shape news coverage and public interest. The case involves a ransom demand in Bitcoin, adding a modern twist to the unfolding story. It remains under active investigation.</p>
