    <h2>Global Politics and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Iran has expressed willingness to negotiate compromises to revive the nuclear deal. Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, told the BBC that the next step depends on the United States to show its commitment to making an agreement. This development highlights ongoing diplomatic efforts amid long-standing tensions over Iran’s nuclear program.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine’s former energy minister was detained while trying to leave the country. His detention relates to legal proceedings following his dismissal during a corruption scandal. This reflects continuing anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, with potential implications for the country’s political and energy sectors.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In northern Gaza, Israeli strikes killed at least 11 people, including six in a tent encampment, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. These strikes contribute to the ongoing cycle of violence in the region, further exacerbating humanitarian concerns.</p>
<p>In Nigeria’s Niger State, armed men conducted motorbike raids on villages, killing dozens, burning homes, and abducting an unknown number of people. This attack underscores the continuing security challenges in parts of Nigeria, affecting civilian safety and stability.</p>
<h2>International Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>The UK has accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny using a toxin derived from a dart frog. The British Foreign Office stated there is no innocent explanation for the toxin found in Navalny’s body samples. This accusation adds to tensions between Russia and Western countries over human rights and political repression issues.</p>
<p>Ghana has requested Russia to extradite a man described as a "pick-up artist," who is accused of secretly filming women during sexual encounters without their consent. This case raises concerns about privacy violations and cross-border legal cooperation.</p>
<h2>US Legal and Security News</h2>
<p>The US attorney general has faced criticism from lawmakers over the claim that all files related to Jeffrey Epstein have been released. Critics, including those involved in the law mandating the publication, say the release is incomplete, highlighting ongoing demands for transparency regarding the Epstein case.</p>
<p>In the Indian Ocean, US authorities intercepted a second tanker named Veronica III, accusing it of violating a “quarantine” on oil shipments from Venezuela. This move reflects increased enforcement of US sanctions and the complexities of international maritime security.</p>
<h2>Social Movements and Travel</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide participated in protests supporting movements in Iran, with large crowds reported in cities like Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto. Smaller demonstrations also took place in Tel Aviv and Lisbon, indicating widespread global solidarity on Iranian issues.</p>
<p>On a different note, China announced it will allow visa-free travel starting 17 February for British and Canadian nationals. This policy change is expected to facilitate easier travel and potentially boost tourism and business exchanges between these countries.</p>
