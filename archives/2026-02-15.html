    <h2>Middle East Nuclear Talks</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said in an interview with the BBC in Tehran that Iran is ready to discuss compromises to achieve a nuclear deal. He emphasized that the “ball is in America’s court,” suggesting that the United States needs to demonstrate a genuine willingness to reach an agreement. This statement indicates a potential reopening of diplomatic efforts toward resolving tensions over Iran’s nuclear program. The next steps depend largely on how the U.S. responds to Iran’s overture.</p>
<h2>UK Accuses Russia in Navalny Poisoning</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office has accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny using a rare dart frog toxin. British officials stated that there is no innocent explanation for the toxin being found in samples taken from Navalny’s body. This assertion adds to international concerns about Navalny’s poisoning and suggests a direct state involvement in the attack, raising further questions about accountability and diplomatic consequences for Russia.</p>
<h2>Violence in Nigeria’s Niger State</h2>
<p>At least 30 people have been killed in a series of violent motorbike raids on villages in Niger state, Nigeria. The assailants reportedly shot victims, cut throats, set homes on fire, and abducted multiple individuals. This violence highlights continuing security challenges in the region, with significant humanitarian implications including displacement and trauma for affected communities. The situation calls for urgent attention to improve local security and support victims.</p>
<h2>US Democratic Leaders Reassure Europe</h2>
<p>A group of top US Democratic politicians attended a summit in Munich to offer an alternative vision to the “America First” approach. They sought to reassure European allies and presented themselves as future leaders of the party. One key message was a prediction that the current political figure dominating US politics will be “gone in three years,” suggesting confidence in changing political dynamics. This outreach reflects ongoing efforts to strengthen transatlantic ties amid global challenges.</p>
<h2>High-Profile Abduction Case Captures US Attention</h2>
<p>The abduction of Nancy Guthrie has become a nationally followed story in the United States, partly due to the involvement of her daughter, TV icon Savannah Guthrie. Media coverage has turned the case into a broader public obsession, with widespread interest in developments and appeals for information. The case underscores how the involvement of well-known figures can influence public engagement in missing person investigations.</p>
<h2>Unnoticed Multimillion-Euro Heist in Europe</h2>
<p>A multimillion-euro theft occurred from a vault, raising questions about how the thieves knew the vault’s location and why no alarms were triggered. Observers have speculated about the possibility of an inside job due to the precision and silence of the operation, including the apparent lack of noise from drilling. Authorities are investigating the incident as they work to understand the methods used and identify suspects. This case highlights challenges in securing valuable assets even in heavily protected environments.</p>
