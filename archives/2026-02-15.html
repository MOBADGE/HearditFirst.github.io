    <h2>Middle East Conflict</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes on northern Gaza killed at least 11 people, including six in a strike on a tent encampment, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The attacks reflect ongoing tensions and violence in the region, continuing to cause civilian casualties and humanitarian concerns. The situation remains fragile, with no immediate resolution in sight.</p>
<h2>Iran Nuclear Talks and Global Protests</h2>
<p>Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said in an interview with the BBC that Iran is willing to discuss compromises to revive the nuclear deal. However, he emphasized that the "ball was in America's court" to demonstrate willingness for an agreement. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide participated in protests supporting Iran, with large gatherings in cities such as Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto, and smaller events in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. These demonstrations highlight the global engagement with Iran’s political situation.</p>
<h2>Russia and International Legal Cases</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny using a toxin derived from dart frogs, stating there is no innocent explanation for the toxin’s presence in Navalny’s samples. This allegation adds to tensions between Russia and Western countries over suspected state actions against dissidents.</p>
<p>Separately, Ghana has requested Russia to extradite a Russian man accused of secretly filming women during sexual encounters without their consent. The case has drawn attention to concerns about privacy violations and cross-border cooperation in criminal matters.</p>
<h2>Security Issues in Africa</h2>
<p>In Nigeria’s Niger State, armed men on motorbikes conducted raids that resulted in dozens of deaths, destruction of homes, and the abduction of an undetermined number of people. This wave of violence emphasizes ongoing security challenges in parts of Nigeria, contributing to local instability and humanitarian issues.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Travel</h2>
<p>China announced it will allow visa-free travel for UK and Canadian nationals starting 17 February. This easing of travel restrictions is part of China’s efforts to promote international travel and strengthen ties with these countries amid shifting global diplomatic landscapes.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the US and Europe</h2>
<p>Opposition politicians from the United States met at a summit in Munich to present alternatives to the America First policy and sought to position themselves as future party leaders. Some participants expressed confidence that President Donald Trump would be out of office within three years, aiming to reassure European allies about the United States' political direction. This event underscores ongoing debates about US leadership and its impact on transatlantic relations.</p>
