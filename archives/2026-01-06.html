    <h2>Venezuela's Political Turmoil Continues</h2>
<p>Venezuela has taken a dramatic step as an interim president was sworn in following a period of political tension. This development comes amid President Nicolás Maduro pleading not guilty to unspecified charges. Delcy Rodríguez, a prominent figure aligned with Maduro, expressed deep distress, describing what she called the "kidnapping" of Maduro and his wife by the United States. The situation remains fluid and highlights ongoing disputes over Venezuela's leadership. The swearing-in of an interim president indicates a contested political landscape, and it remains to be seen how this will affect the country’s stability and international relations.</p>
<h2>South Korea and China Seek Closer Relations</h2>
<p>In a sign of warming ties between South Korea and China, South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung embarked on a four-day visit to Beijing aimed at ushering in a "new phase" in bilateral relationships. During the visit, Lee was seen taking selfies with China's Xi Jinping, symbolizing a friendly and less formal approach to diplomacy. This move suggests an intention to strengthen cooperation and dialogue between the two countries, which could have implications for regional politics and economic partnerships. The visit may lead to increased collaboration and a more stable relationship in East Asia going forward.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Both Venezuela and South Korea are navigating moments of considerable change. Venezuela’s political crisis is still unfolding, with the international community closely watching for further developments regarding Maduro and the interim leadership. Meanwhile, South Korea's engagement with China might signal a shift towards greater regional cooperation, potentially influencing trade, security, and political discussions in the coming months. These events underscore how leadership dynamics and diplomatic efforts shape global affairs today.</p>
