    <h2>Global Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Protests have intensified in Iran, spreading across more than 50 towns and cities, including regions known for strong government support. Videos shared online show the widening unrest, signaling growing national discontent. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, the president has replaced the head of a key security agency, a move that has drawn significant criticism amid ongoing conflict. At the same time, French President Macron is hosting talks with Ukraine and its allies to discuss security guarantees, as Russia continues attacks targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>In another geopolitical development, Israel’s foreign minister made a historic visit to Somaliland, marking the first official recognition of Somaliland’s independence by any country. This move is notable given Somaliland’s lack of widespread international recognition.</p>
<h2>Tensions Involving the United States and Europe</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump stated that American oil companies could potentially resume operations in Venezuela within 18 months, expressing his ambitions to expand US energy presence there. However, analysts warn that such developments would require considerable time and effort.</p>
<p>Trump has also sparked controversy in Europe by refusing to rule out the use of force to annex Greenland. This prompted strong backlash from Denmark, which warned that such an action could threaten the existence of NATO. European allies have expressed support for Denmark in this dispute, emphasizing the importance of alliance unity.</p>
<h2>Press Freedom and Public Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, security forces detained 14 journalists while armed police patrolled the streets. Many Venezuelans reported fear of speaking out publicly as authorities also monitored social media activity. This reflects ongoing challenges to press freedom and civil liberties in the country.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, questions have been raised about safety oversight following a deadly New Year’s Eve fire at a ski bar in Crans-Montana, which resulted in 40 deaths and 116 injuries. Officials revealed the bar had not been inspected for five years before the tragedy, raising concerns about regulatory enforcement.</p>
<h2>Legal and Consumer Updates</h2>
<p>In France, Cyril Zattara, who identified as a hypnotherapist, stood trial on charges including drugging and raping 14 women over the past decade and secretly filming others. The case has brought attention to issues of abuse and consent.</p>
<p>On the consumer front, Nestlé has issued a global recall of certain batches of SMA infant and follow-on formula following concerns that some products could cause vomiting. The company’s action aims to ensure the safety of infant nutrition worldwide.</p>
