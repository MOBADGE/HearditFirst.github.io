    <h2>Global Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Videos from January 6 show that anti-government protests in Iran have expanded widely, now reaching more than 40 towns and cities across the country. This includes areas typically known as strongholds for the government. The unrest signals growing dissatisfaction and widespread participation, reflecting deep tensions within the country. The situation remains fluid, and how authorities will respond to such broad-scale protests is a key question going forward.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy and Security</h2>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron hosted talks with Ukraine and allied countries to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine amid ongoing conflict. These discussions come as Russia continues attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, tensions involving the United States and Greenland have escalated, with Donald Trump not ruling out force to annex Greenland. Denmark, whose territory includes Greenland, warned this could end NATO and received support from European allies regarding their stance against any annexation efforts.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Swiss Ski Resort</h2>
<p>A fire at a ski bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, on New Year's Eve resulted in 40 deaths and 116 injuries. Authorities revealed the bar had not been inspected for five years before the deadly blaze. This lapse in safety inspections raises concerns about regulatory oversight in public venues. Investigations into the cause of the fire and responsibility are ongoing.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings in France</h2>
<p>Cyril Zattara, who describes himself as a hypnotherapist, went on trial in France charged with serious crimes including raping 14 women over a decade and secretly filming others. The case has drawn attention to issues of abuse of trust and exploitation in alternative therapy settings. The trial is a major step towards accountability for the alleged victims.</p>
<h2>Corporate Safety and Consumer Alerts</h2>
<p>Nestlé announced a global recall of certain batches of its SMA infant and follow-on baby formula after discovering a potential toxin risk. The affected products could cause vomiting, prompting the company to act quickly to protect consumers. Parents and caregivers are advised to check product details and follow recall instructions.</p>
<h2>Technology Advances in AI and Transportation</h2>
<p>Nvidia introduced new self-driving car technology as part of its efforts to expand artificial intelligence applications beyond software to physical products. This development signals a broader push by tech companies to integrate AI into everyday life, including transportation systems, which could reshape industries and daily routines in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Migrant Tragedy in Ethiopia</h2>
<p>Authorities reported that at least 22 Ethiopian migrants were killed in a road crash while attempting to leave the country. The migrants numbered about 85 in total. This incident highlights the ongoing risks faced by people seeking to leave challenging conditions in Ethiopia and underscores the need for safer migration routes and support systems.</p>
