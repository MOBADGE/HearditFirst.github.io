    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 06, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Political Changes</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, President Zelensky has replaced the chief of the country's powerful security service. This move has sparked significant criticism amid ongoing conflict and security challenges in the region. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, 14 journalists from foreign news outlets have been detained by security forces as authorities increase social media monitoring. Many Venezuelans report growing fear around speaking openly, reflecting tightening controls on information and media freedom.</p>
<h2>Protests and Conflict</h2>
<p>Iran is experiencing widespread anti-government protests, with unrest spreading to more than 50 towns and cities, including areas typically supportive of the government. This expansion hints at deeper national dissatisfaction. In Sudan, a drone strike in el-Obeid city has resulted in the deaths of at least 13 people, including eight children, underscoring the ongoing violence and humanitarian concerns in the region.</p>
<h2>European Weather Disruptions and Tragedy</h2>
<p>Heavy snowfall across Europe has caused severe transport disruptions, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights in cities such as Amsterdam and Paris and leaving thousands stranded. In Switzerland, a deadly New Year's Eve fire at a ski bar in Crans-Montana has been linked to inadequate safety inspections, as local officials revealed the venue had not been inspected for five years. The fire claimed 40 lives and injured 116 others.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Developments and Alliances</h2>
<p>French President Macron hosted Ukraine and its allies in talks focused on bolstering security guarantees amid continued Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. These discussions come amid heightened geopolitical tensions, including U.S. threats to annex Greenland. Denmark has rallied European support against such a move, warning that annexation would effectively end the NATO alliance. In a separate diplomatic development, Israel made a historic visit to Somaliland and became the first country to officially recognize Somaliland as independent, a move that has generated controversy.</p>
<h2>U.S. Political Update</h2>
<p>In the United States, the sudden death of Congressman Doug LaMalfa, an ally of former President Trump, has reduced the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to a slim margin. This change may affect the balance of power and dynamics in upcoming legislative sessions.</p>
