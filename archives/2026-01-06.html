    <h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>US officials have obtained a warrant to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker suspected of violating sanctions while en route to Europe. This move reflects ongoing tensions over enforcement of international trade rules. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting Ukraine and its allies to discuss security guarantees amid continued Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. These talks take place against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, including former US President Donald Trump's recent refusal to rule out using force to annex Greenland—a scenario Denmark warns could threaten NATO unity.</p>
<h2>Political and Social Unrest</h2>
<p>Anti-government protests in Iran have reportedly spread to over 50 towns and cities, including areas traditionally supportive of the government. This widespread unrest is captured in videos shared publicly. In Venezuela, 14 foreign journalists have been detained by security forces, with authorities also monitoring social media activity. Venezuelans describe a climate of fear around expressing dissent, highlighting ongoing concerns about press freedom and government control.</p>
<h2>Tragic Incidents and Disasters</h2>
<p>A deadly fire in a Swiss ski bar in Crans-Montana, which killed 40 people and injured 116, occurred in a venue that had not been inspected for safety in over five years, according to the local mayor. Elsewhere, severe winter weather has caused disruption across Europe, with six deaths and hundreds of flight cancellations in cities like Amsterdam and Paris, leaving thousands stranded. In Sudan, a drone strike hit a home in el-Obeid city, killing at least 13 people, including eight children, as reported by medics.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Ukraine and the United States</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s president has replaced the head of the country’s powerful security service amid criticism of the decision. The agency had previously been regarded as successful, making the leadership change notable in the ongoing conflict context. In the United States, Congress member Doug LaMalfa, known as an ally of Donald Trump, died unexpectedly at age 65. His passing reduces the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to a slim margin, potentially impacting legislative dynamics.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These developments capture a snapshot of ongoing global political tensions, social unrest, and humanitarian crises shaping the early days of 2026. Monitoring responses to these events will be important for understanding future geopolitical and domestic shifts.</p>
