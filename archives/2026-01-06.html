    <h2>International Security and Ukraine</h2>
<p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced after a meeting in Paris that the UK and France are prepared to send troops to Ukraine, but only if a peace deal is reached. French President Emmanuel Macron hosted the talks, which aimed to strengthen security guarantees for Ukraine amid ongoing Russian attacks, particularly targeting the country’s energy infrastructure. This diplomatic effort comes at a tense time with broader geopolitical concerns in Europe.</p>
<h2>Russia and Sanctions Enforcement</h2>
<p>US officials have obtained a warrant to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker currently headed to Europe. The ship is accused of violating sanctions, although details about the vessel or its cargo were not specified. This move highlights continuing efforts by the US to enforce sanctions on Russia in response to the ongoing conflict and related geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>Protests and Unrest in Iran and Venezuela</h2>
<p>Widespread anti-government protests in Iran have expanded to more than 50 towns and cities, including areas usually supportive of the government. Videos from the country show growing unrest across provinces indicating deepening dissatisfaction with the regime.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, authorities detained 14 journalists from foreign news organizations amid increasing restrictions and social media monitoring. Local residents expressed fear about openly speaking out, highlighting a deteriorating environment for press freedom and civil liberties.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Disrupts Europe</h2>
<p>Heavy snowfall caused significant disruptions across Europe, leading to the deaths of six people and the cancellation of hundreds of flights in major hubs like Amsterdam and Paris. Thousands of travelers were stranded as infrastructure struggled under the winter conditions, impacting transport and daily life.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>In Sudan’s el-Obeid city, a drone strike hit a residential area, killing at least 13 people, including eight children, according to medical sources.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Switzerland, the mayor of Crans-Montana revealed that a ski bar where a New Year’s Eve fire killed 40 people and injured 116 had not been inspected for five years, raising concerns about safety oversight.</p>
<p>Lastly, tensions around Greenland remain high after former US President Donald Trump refused to rule out the use of force to annex the territory.</p>
<p>Denmark has warned that such a move could spell the end of NATO, and European allies have backed Denmark amid these threats.</p>
