    <h2>Venezuela's Political Crisis Continues</h2>
<p>Venezuela is experiencing heightened political tensions following the swearing-in of an interim president. This development comes amid significant turmoil after Nicolás Maduro pleaded not guilty in a US court, where he faces charges. Meanwhile, Delcy Rodríguez expressed deep distress over what she described as the "kidnapping" of Maduro and his wife. This ongoing conflict underscores the continuing instability in Venezuela, with potential implications for the country's governance and international relations.</p>
<h2>South Korea Seeks Improved Relations with China</h2>
<p>South Korea is aiming to enter a "new phase" in its relationship with China during a four-day visit by Lee Jae Myung. As part of the efforts to strengthen ties, Lee took informal steps such as snapping selfies with China's leader Xi Jinping. This visit highlights South Korea's interest in enhancing diplomatic and economic cooperation with its neighbor, signaling a possible shift towards closer engagement between the two countries after a period of strained relations.</p>
