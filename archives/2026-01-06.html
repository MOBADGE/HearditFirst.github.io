    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a meeting with Ukrainian officials and their allies to discuss security guarantees amid ongoing conflict. The talks come as Russia continues attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The meeting also took place against a backdrop of tensions over US statements regarding Greenland. Separately, a US aide stated that no country would confront the United States over Greenland, while six European nations emphasized that only Greenland and Denmark have the authority to decide the territory’s future.</p>
<p>In a notable diplomatic development, Israel’s foreign minister visited Somaliland on a historic trip. Israel became the first country to officially recognize Somaliland as an independent state, a move that has drawn significant attention internationally.</p>
<h2>Energy and Industry Developments</h2>
<p>Donald Trump expressed confidence that US oil companies could be operational in Venezuela within 18 months if conditions allow. While Trump openly articulated ambitions for expanded US energy operations in the country, analysts caution that such a timeline may be optimistic given the complexities involved.</p>
<p>In parallel, Nvidia unveiled new technology aimed at advancing self-driving cars, seeking to extend its artificial intelligence capabilities beyond software into physical products. This move illustrates the company’s effort to broaden AI applications into more tangible innovations.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Health</h2>
<p>Swiss officials disclosed that a ski bar in Crans-Montana had not undergone fire safety inspections for five years prior to a deadly New Year’s Eve fire. The tragic incident resulted in 40 deaths and 116 injuries, raising concerns about safety oversight in public venues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nestlé initiated a global recall of certain batches of its SMA infant and follow-on formula. The recall followed the discovery that these products might cause vomiting in babies, underscoring ongoing attention to food safety and consumer health.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Africa and South Asia</h2>
<p>In the Central African Republic, the president secured a third term in office following a referendum that removed term limits. The main opposition coalition boycotted the election, leading to a landslide victory for the incumbent leader.</p>
<p>In India, a 26-year-old survivor of a gang rape returned home after spending a week in hospital with serious head, facial, and bone injuries. The case has drawn widespread attention, highlighting ongoing concerns about violence against women and the need for survivor support.</p>
<h2>Culture and Events</h2>
<p>Tomorrowland, one of the world’s most iconic electronic dance music festivals, announced plans to hold a three-day event in Thailand. Founded 20 years ago, the festival continues to expand its global reach and celebrate electronic music culture in new locations.</p>
