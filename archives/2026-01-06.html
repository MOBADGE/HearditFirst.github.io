    <h2>Ukraine and Security Talks in Europe</h2>
<p>The UK and France have pledged to send troops to Ukraine if a peace deal is reached, according to UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. This announcement came after a meeting in Paris involving Ukraine and its allies, aiming to solidify security guarantees. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted discussions to strengthen support for Ukraine amid ongoing Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. These developments highlight continued international efforts to back Ukraine's sovereignty and could shape the security landscape in Europe if formal agreements are made.</p>
<h2>Rising Unrest and Security Concerns Worldwide</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have spread across more than 50 towns and cities, including areas typically supportive of the government. Videos circulated show the scale of the unrest, pointing to broad dissatisfaction. In Venezuela, 14 journalists from foreign media have been detained by security forces, with police monitoring social media closely. Residents express fear around speaking out, illustrating increasing restrictions on free expression in the country. These events reflect growing tensions and government crackdowns in different parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Tragic Incidents and Threats to Safety</h2>
<p>A deadly drone strike in el-Obeid city, Sudan, has killed at least 13 people, including eight children, according to medics. In Switzerland, a major fire at a ski bar in Crans-Montana over New Year's Eve resulted in 40 deaths and 116 injuries. The local mayor revealed the establishment had not been inspected for five years before the incident, raising questions about safety oversight. Both tragedies underscore ongoing risks faced by civilians in conflict zones and during public events.</p>
<h2>Political Developments and International Tensions</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky has replaced the head of the powerful security service, a move that has drawn significant criticism amid the country's conflict with Russia. Meanwhile, the US is facing diplomatic friction with Denmark after former US President Donald Trump refused to rule out military action to annex Greenland. Denmark warned such a move could jeopardize NATO, showing continuing strains among Western allies even as they collaborate on Ukraine.</p>
<h2>US Political Landscape</h2>
<p>US Congressman Doug LaMalfa, an ally of Donald Trump, died unexpectedly at age 65. His passing reduces the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to just a few seats, which may influence the balance of power and upcoming legislative decisions in Washington.</p>
<h2>Weather Disruptions in Europe</h2>
<p>Heavy snow across Europe has caused widespread travel chaos, including hundreds of flight cancellations in Amsterdam and Paris. The severe weather has led to six deaths and left thousands stranded, emphasizing the ongoing challenges posed by winter storms to public safety and transportation networks.</p>
