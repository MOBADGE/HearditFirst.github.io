    <h2>Media Restrictions in Venezuela</h2>
<p>Venezuelan security forces have detained 14 journalists from foreign news organizations amid increased government scrutiny. Police have also been monitoring social media activity closely. These actions contribute to a climate of fear among Venezuelans about speaking out publicly. The tightening controls on the media and online expression highlight ongoing challenges to press freedom in the country.</p>
<h2>Political Changes and Unrest in Ukraine and Iran</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s president has replaced the head of the country’s main security service, a move that has drawn significant criticism. The agency has been seen as one of the country's most effective security bodies, making the reshuffle a notable shift in Ukraine’s security landscape.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Iran, anti-government protests have expanded across more than half of the country’s provinces, including areas traditionally seen as supporters of the government. Videos showing unrest in over 50 towns and cities underscore rising tensions and widespread dissatisfaction.</p>
<h2>Deadly Conflict and Tragedies</h2>
<p>In Sudan, a drone strike in the city of el-Obeid killed at least 13 people, including eight children, according to medical officials. The incident adds to the ongoing violence affecting civilians in the region.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, a deadly fire at a ski bar in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve resulted in 40 deaths and 116 injuries. Local authorities revealed that the bar had not undergone safety inspections for five years, raising questions about regulatory oversight.</p>
<h2>European Winter Weather Disruptions</h2>
<p>Heavy snowfall across Europe has caused severe travel disruption, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations in major hubs such as Amsterdam and Paris. Thousands of travelers have been stranded as transportation networks struggle to cope with the severe weather. The snowstorm also resulted in six fatalities, highlighting the dangerous conditions.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Ukraine’s officials and allied representatives to discuss security guarantees amid ongoing Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. These talks underscore continuing efforts to support Ukraine during the conflict.</p>
<p>At the same time, Denmark has received backing from European allies following comments from former US President Donald Trump that did not rule out using force to annex Greenland. Denmark warned that such a move could threaten the future of NATO, underscoring tensions around territorial sovereignty and alliance cohesion.</p>
<p>Additionally, Israel made a historic visit to Somaliland, becoming the first country to formally recognize it as an independent state. The decision was viewed as controversial given Somaliland’s limited international recognition.</p>
<h2>US Political News</h2>
<p>Doug LaMalfa, a US Congressman and ally of Donald Trump, died unexpectedly at the age of 65. His passing reduces the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to a narrow margin, potentially affecting legislative dynamics in Washington.</p>
