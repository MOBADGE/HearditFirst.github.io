    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung is on a four-day visit to China, where he has taken selfies with China's Xi Jinping. This visit is seen as an effort to usher in a "new phase" in relations between South Korea and China. Strengthening diplomatic ties may have implications for regional cooperation and economic partnerships in East Asia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Central African Republic, the president has won a third term in office by a large margin. The main opposition coalition boycotted the election following a referendum that allowed the removal of presidential term limits. This development raises questions about the political landscape and governance in the country going forward.</p>
<h2>Technology and Innovation</h2>
<p>Chipmaker Nvidia has unveiled its new "Alpamayo" artificial intelligence technology designed for self-driving cars. The company is partnering with Mercedes-Benz to launch a driverless vehicle powered by this AI system. This advancement could mark significant progress in autonomous vehicle technology and impact the future of transportation and automotive safety.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Consumer Alerts</h2>
<p>Nestle has issued a global recall of some batches of its SMA infant and follow-on formula products. The recall was prompted by concerns that certain batches could cause vomiting. This action highlights ongoing vigilance around product safety in the baby food market and the importance of consumer awareness.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Justice</h2>
<p>In South Africa, families face long waits for justice as tens of thousands of court cases remain pending. Some individuals are waiting up to four years for their trials to begin, reflecting challenges in the judicial system that affect public trust and the timely resolution of legal matters.</p>
<p>Separately, a 26-year-old Indian woman who survived a gang rape has returned home after spending a week in hospital. She was initially admitted with serious head and facial injuries as well as several fractures. Her recovery underscores ongoing issues of violence against women and the need for continued support and protection.</p>
<h2>Culture and Environment</h2>
<p>Skiers in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, formed a heart shape on the slopes as a tribute to the 40 people who died in a recent fire at the ski resort town. This gesture expresses community solidarity and remembrance following the tragedy.</p>
<p>In India, farmers are increasingly cultivating the butterfly pea flower, known for its striking blue color. This crop is gaining popularity due to growing demand and is helping to improve farmers' incomes. The trend illustrates how agricultural innovation can offer new economic opportunities for rural communities.</p>
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<p>Netflix has removed a Chinese drama called Shine on Me after protests in Vietnam. The controversy centers on an episode that showed a map featuring disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea, touching on sensitive geopolitical issues in the region.</p>
<p>In sports, women's tennis world number one Aryna Sabalenka highlighted the lasting impact of the "Battle of the Sexes" tennis match during a strong season-opening victory in Brisbane. The event is credited with boosting attention and popularity for women's tennis.</p>
