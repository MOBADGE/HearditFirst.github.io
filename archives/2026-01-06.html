    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 06, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Protests and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Large-scale anti-government protests continue to spread in Iran, with videos showing unrest in more than 50 towns and cities, including areas that typically support the government. In Venezuela, security forces have increased their presence, detaining 14 media workers amid fears among civilians about speaking out. Armed police patrol the streets and reportedly check individuals’ social media, highlighting a tense and restrictive environment.</p>
<h2>Political and Security Developments</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, the president has replaced the head of the country’s influential security service. This decision has sparked heavy criticism, as the agency has been regarded as one of the country's most effective. Meanwhile, French courts have begun the trial of Cyril Zattara, a self-described hypnotherapist charged with drugging and raping 14 women over the past decade, in addition to secretly filming some victims.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>France’s President Macron hosted talks with Ukraine and its allies to discuss security guarantees amid ongoing Russian attacks targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure. At the same time, Denmark has expressed concern over statements from Donald Trump who refused to rule out the use of force to annex Greenland. European allies have shown support for Denmark, warning that any such move would threaten NATO’s future. In a separate diplomatic milestone, Israel’s foreign minister visited Somaliland, marking Israel as the first country to formally recognize Somaliland as an independent state, a move that has been met with controversy.</p>
<h2>Business and Safety News</h2>
<p>Nestlé, the global food company, has issued a worldwide recall of certain batches of its SMA infant and follow-on formula due to potential toxin-related risks that could cause vomiting. In Switzerland, the aftermath of a deadly New Year’s Eve fire in a ski bar in Crans-Montana continues to raise questions after officials revealed the bar had not undergone safety inspections for five years. The fire resulted in 40 deaths and 116 injuries.</p>
<h2>Energy Sector Outlook</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has expressed ambitions for American oil companies to resume operations in Venezuela within 18 months. However, analysts caution that restarting large-scale production in the country’s oil sector would take significant time, despite Trump's openness about these plans.</p>
