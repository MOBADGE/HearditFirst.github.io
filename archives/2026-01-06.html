    <h2>Venezuela Political Crisis</h2>
<p>Venezuela is experiencing a significant political upheaval as an interim president was sworn in amid ongoing conflict with Nicolás Maduro. Maduro has pleaded not guilty to undisclosed charges while facing opposition claims. Delcy Rodríguez, a Venezuelan official, accused the United States of "kidnapping" Maduro and his wife, reflecting heightened tensions. This development deepens the political crisis in Venezuela and could impact international relations and internal stability in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Potential U.S. Foreign Policy Moves</h2>
<p>Following the situation in Venezuela, there is discussion about which countries might next attract attention from former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has reportedly made multiple threats against various nations within Washington’s sphere of influence. How this rhetoric might translate into concrete policy or actions remains uncertain, but it suggests the potential for increased diplomatic or geopolitical pressure in the near future.</p>
<h2>South Korea-China Relations</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung is on a four-day visit to China, signaling a desire to improve bilateral relations between the two countries. During the visit, Lee and Chinese leader Xi Jinping engaged in informal interactions, including taking selfies together, highlighting a move toward a "new phase" in ties. This visit indicates an effort to strengthen cooperation and ease regional tensions, which could have broader implications for East Asian diplomacy and economic collaboration.</p>
