    <h2>US Politics</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton told a House panel that she "had no idea" about Jeffrey Epstein's sexual crimes. During a closed-door deposition, the former secretary of state denied any knowledge of Epstein's misconduct prior to it becoming public. Clinton also called for President Donald Trump to be questioned under oath regarding his past association with Epstein. This development comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Epstein’s network and those connected to him. At the same time, at least 10 FBI agents involved in an investigation into Trump’s handling of classified documents following his first term have been fired, highlighting continuing tensions around legal probes linked to the former president.</p>
<h2>Cuba’s Political Situation</h2>
<p>Cuba faces one of its biggest internal crises since its revolution, raising questions about the future stability of its government. Analysts suggest that worsening economic and political conditions could challenge the longstanding revolutionary regime from within. While the details of this internal crisis are evolving, the situation underscores growing uncertainty about Cuba’s direction in the coming years and the resilience of its current leadership.</p>
<h2>China’s Military Leadership Changes</h2>
<p>China has removed nine military officials ahead of its important annual Two Sessions political meeting. No official reasons were provided for these dismissals. The timing suggests that the changes could be related to the country’s preparation for major policy discussions and leadership decisions expected at the event, which shapes China’s political and military strategies going forward.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business Shifts</h2>
<p>Jack Dorsey's company Block is cutting thousands of jobs as it refocuses its efforts on artificial intelligence (AI). Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter, expressed his belief that many businesses will undergo similar workforce reductions as AI technologies transform industries in the next year. In another major business development, Paramount is set to acquire Warner Bros in a $111 billion deal after Netflix dropped out of the bidding war. This move could reshape the entertainment industry by consolidating two major studios under one company.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns in Yemen</h2>
<p>Aid organizations in Yemen report being pushed to the brink by Houthi rebels controlling large parts of the country. These groups provide vital support to millions of Yemenis but have faced increasing obstacles, including the seizure of resources by the rebels. The situation threatens to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where ongoing conflict continues to create urgent needs for aid and relief efforts.</p>
<h2>Disinformation and Security Challenges</h2>
<p>Security experts warn that Russia is using AI-generated videos to amplify its online disinformation campaigns. These sophisticated AI tools are making it harder for Western governments to detect and respond to false information spreading online. This new frontier in digital warfare poses significant challenges for information security and democratic processes globally.</p>
