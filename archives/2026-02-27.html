    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>President Trump expressed dissatisfaction with Iran following recent talks about the country's nuclear program. Although unhappy with Iran's position, he has not made a decision on whether to launch a military attack. This stance maintains uncertainty around the future of diplomatic efforts and potential conflict in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan's defence minister stated that the country is in an "open war" with Afghanistan after a series of strikes. This escalation follows months of clashes despite a fragile ceasefire agreed upon in October, indicating ongoing tensions and instability along the border.</p>
<p>In Europe, Sweden's prime minister reported that a drone jammed near a French aircraft carrier was of Russian origin. The incident was serious but not unexpected, reflecting what Sweden describes as a familiar pattern of Russian tactics in other areas.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>Dozens of well-known aid organizations operating in Gaza and the West Bank faced the threat of shutdown due to a new Israeli law. However, an Israeli court has temporarily paused the ban, providing a temporary lifeline to these groups. The ruling's temporary nature suggests continued uncertainty for humanitarian operations in the region.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Public Safety</h2>
<p>A tram in Milan derailed during rush hour after apparently crashing into the side of a building. The accident resulted in two deaths and left dozens of people injured. The incident highlights the challenges of urban transport safety in densely populated areas.</p>
<h2>Business and Economy</h2>
<p>Netflix has dropped out of the bidding war for Warner Bros, clearing the way for Paramount to acquire the company in a deal worth $111 billion. This development marks a major shift in the entertainment industry's landscape, with Paramount poised to significantly expand its holdings.</p>
<h2>Technology and AI Regulation</h2>
<p>Following a shooting incident in Tumbler Ridge linked to an individual whose ChatGPT account raised internal concerns at OpenAI, the company has pledged changes to its safety policies. Canada's AI minister plans to meet OpenAI CEO Sam Altman next week to discuss the incident and potential regulatory responses. This dialogue signals growing government interest in overseeing AI safety and accountability.</p>
<h2>Conflict-Related Casualties</h2>
<p>Ghana has reported at least 55 of its citizens killed in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, representing the highest confirmed number of casualties from a single African country. This highlights the broader international impact of the conflict, affecting nationals far beyond the immediate region.</p>
