    <h2>South Asia Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have worsened, with Pakistan's defence minister stating that the country is now in "open war" with its neighbour following recent bombing strikes. These attacks mark the most significant escalation since a fragile ceasefire was agreed upon in October 2025. Although clashes had been ongoing for several months, the scale of the latest bombings signals a notable deterioration in the security situation. The full physical impact of the strikes remains unclear, but the situation is raising concerns about further destabilization in the region.</p>
<h2>Military Incident Near French Aircraft Carrier</h2>
<p>Sweden's defence minister has indicated a likely "strong link" between a drone jamming event near a French aircraft carrier and a Russian naval vessel operating in the area. The drone malfunction disrupts military operations and adds to the rising tensions involving Russia and European military forces. This incident underlines growing concerns in Northern Europe about Russian military activities and highlights potential challenges to NATO and allied security efforts in the region.</p>
<h2>Media Industry Update: Paramount to Acquire Warner Bros</h2>
<p>Paramount appears poised to complete a takeover of Warner Bros valued at $111 billion, following Netflix's decision to withdraw from the bidding competition. Netflix's exit clears the way for Paramount to win the deal, which will significantly reshape the media landscape by consolidating two major entertainment companies. This acquisition is expected to enhance Paramount's content library and competitive position in the streaming and film distribution markets.</p>
<h2>Impact of Ukraine Conflict on Ghana</h2>
<p>The Russia-Ukraine war continues to exact a human toll beyond the immediate combatants, with Ghana reporting at least 55 of its nationals killed in the conflict. This represents the highest confirmed number of casualties from any single African country involved. The loss underscores the widespread impact of the war, including on foreign nationals living or working in the conflict zone.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Spain and India</h2>
<p>In Spain, the leader of the main opposition party has called for former King Juan Carlos, currently in exile, to return and spend his remaining years with dignity. Juan Carlos, aged 88, remains a contentious figure, and this appeal highlights ongoing debates about his legacy and the monarchy's role in Spain.</p>
<p>In India, former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was cleared of corruption charges. Kejriwal had been arrested in March 2024, prior to the general election, and spent several months in jail. Additionally, India and Israel announced plans to strengthen ties in defence and technology, a move that has drawn criticism from opposition parties for potentially sidelining the Palestinian cause. This development signals a shift in India's international partnerships and strategic priorities.</p>
