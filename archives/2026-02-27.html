    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton has publicly stated before a House panel that she "had no idea" about the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. During closed-door testimony, she called for Donald Trump to be questioned under oath regarding his past connections with Epstein. This development adds to ongoing scrutiny surrounding ties between Epstein and prominent figures. Meanwhile, at least 10 FBI agents involved in a probe into Trump’s handling of classified documents after his first term have been fired. The firings come amid continued controversy over investigations linked to Trump and documents.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Technology News</h2>
<p>Jack Dorsey’s company Block, formerly known as Square, is cutting thousands of jobs as it pivots towards artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Dorsey expressed the belief that most companies will make similar staff reductions due to AI integration within a year. This highlights the growing impact of AI on employment in the tech sector. Meanwhile, Paramount has gained an edge in acquiring Warner Bros after Netflix withdrew from the bidding war. The proposed $111 billion takeover would reshape the entertainment industry, marking a major consolidation move.</p>
<h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>Cuba is facing a significant internal crisis marked by widespread blackouts and increasing calls for emergency aid. This situation poses a serious challenge to the stability of the Cuban Revolution, raising questions about whether current hardships might lead to internal unraveling. In China, nine military officials were removed ahead of the crucial Two Sessions political meeting. No reasons were publicly provided, but such changes suggest preparations for key political and military shifts.</p>
<h2>Disinformation and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>New AI-generated videos are playing a role in boosting Russia’s online disinformation campaigns. Security experts warn that Western governments lack adequate tools to effectively counter this emerging threat in digital misinformation. This signals a growing challenge in safeguarding public discourse and national security against increasingly sophisticated manipulation techniques online.</p>
<h2>Jeffrey Epstein Background Update</h2>
<p>New information has surfaced revealing that Jeffrey Epstein was attempting to purchase a luxury palace in Morocco called Bin Ennakhi just days before his arrest in 2019. The deal, however, was never completed. Additionally, the Department of Justice is accused of withholding documents related to Epstein that connect to Donald Trump. These files remain a critical point of contention in ongoing investigations and public interest surrounding Epstein’s network.</p>
