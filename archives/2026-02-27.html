    <h2>US Politics and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton appeared before a House panel and stated she "had no idea" about the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. During her testimony, she called for President Donald Trump to be questioned under oath about his past association with Epstein. This development comes as investigations and public scrutiny continue around Epstein's network and connections to prominent figures.</p>
<p>In a related story, at least 10 FBI agents who worked on a Trump-related investigation have been fired. These agents were involved in probing Trump's handling of classified documents after his first term. The terminations raise questions about ongoing tensions within the FBI and possible repercussions for the investigation's integrity.</p>
<h2>Jeffrey Epstein’s Final Years</h2>
<p>New details have emerged about Epstein's activities shortly before his arrest in 2019. He was reportedly in negotiations to buy a luxury palace called Bin Ennakhi in Morocco. However, the purchase was never completed. This information sheds light on Epstein's movements and financial dealings in the months leading up to his arrest.</p>
<h2>China’s Military Leadership Changes</h2>
<p>China has removed nine military officials without providing an official explanation. This action comes just before the country's important Two Sessions political meeting, a major annual event where key policies and leadership decisions are made. The timing suggests the removals could be linked to broader political or military restructuring ahead of this gathering.</p>
<h2>Business and Technology</h2>
<p>Jack Dorsey's company Block has announced plans to cut thousands of jobs as the firm increases its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Dorsey, known for co-founding Twitter, suggested that many other companies might follow a similar path within the next year. This shift highlights how AI is transforming industries but also bringing significant workforce changes.</p>
<p>In the entertainment industry, Netflix has dropped its bid to acquire Warner Bros, clearing the way for Paramount to win the takeover battle. Netflix’s withdrawal ends a competitive process and could reshape the landscape of media ownership and content production, with Paramount likely to become a larger player.</p>
<h2>Challenges in Cuba</h2>
<p>Cuba is facing a worsening internal crisis marked by blackouts and the need for emergency aid. Observers are questioning whether these challenges could threaten the stability of the Cuban Revolution from within. The economic and social difficulties have intensified, raising concerns about the future direction of the country and its government.</p>
