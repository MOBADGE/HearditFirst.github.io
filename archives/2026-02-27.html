    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 27, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>President Trump expressed dissatisfaction with Iran’s position following recent nuclear talks but has not yet decided on a military response. The situation remains tense and uncertain, with potential for escalation depending on future diplomatic developments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan’s defence minister stated that the country is in an "open war" with Afghanistan following recent cross-border strikes. This comes despite a fragile ceasefire agreement between the two nations that was reached in October, indicating ongoing instability and conflict in the region.</p>
<p>In Europe, Sweden’s prime minister confirmed that a drone jammed near a French aircraft carrier was Russian. He described the incident as serious but not unexpected, characterizing it as a recognized pattern of Russian military behavior. This highlights continuing tensions between Russia and NATO countries.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In the Middle East, aid groups operating in Gaza and the West Bank received a temporary reprieve after an Israeli court paused a threat to shut down dozens of organizations under a new law. The decision provides a short-term lifeline for these groups, though the long-term outcome remains uncertain, potentially impacting humanitarian efforts in the region.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Casualties</h2>
<p>A tram derailment in Milan during rush hour resulted in two deaths and dozens of injuries after the vehicle collided with the side of a building in the city centre. The incident has raised questions about urban transportation safety and emergency response protocols in Italy’s largest city.</p>
<p>In the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Ghana reported at least 55 nationals killed, marking the highest confirmed number of casualties from a single African country in the war. This underscores the international impact of the ongoing conflict and the significant toll on foreign nationals.</p>
<h2>Business and Technology</h2>
<p>Netflix has withdrawn from the bidding war to acquire Warner Bros, clearing the way for Paramount to complete a $111 billion takeover. This move consolidates major players in the media and entertainment industry and may affect competition and content distribution in the coming years.</p>
<p>In technology news, OpenAI announced plans to revise its safety policies after the Tumbler Ridge shooting in Canada. The suspect’s ChatGPT account had raised internal concerns that were not reported to law enforcement. Canada’s AI minister is scheduled to meet with OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman to discuss these issues, highlighting growing scrutiny over AI’s role in public safety.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Stories</h2>
<p>An investigation revealed that disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein had attempted to purchase a luxury palace in Morocco just days before his arrest in 2019. The deal for the Bin Ennakhi property never went through, but the detail adds to the timeline of Epstein’s controversial activities prior to his detainment.</p>
<p>Lastly, an analysis of Cuba’s internal crisis suggests that the Cuban Revolution is facing significant challenges from within. Worsening conditions could threaten the long-standing political regime, raising questions about the future stability of the country.</p>
