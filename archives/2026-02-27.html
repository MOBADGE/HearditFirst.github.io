    <h2>Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton told a House panel that she "had no idea" about Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes. She also called for President Donald Trump to be questioned under oath about his past association with the convicted sex offender. Epstein remains a focus of legal and public interest years after his arrest, shining a light on connections to high-profile individuals.</p>
<p>In related news about Epstein, it was revealed that he tried to buy a luxurious property called Bin Ennakhi in Morocco just days before his 2019 arrest. The purchase did not go through, but the move underscores Epstein’s attempts to maintain a lavish lifestyle amid his legal troubles.</p>
<p>Additionally, at least 10 FBI agents involved in an investigation into Trump’s handling of classified documents after his first term have been fired. The reasons for the terminations have not been detailed, but the move marks a significant development in the ongoing scrutiny of the former president’s actions.</p>
<h2>Business and Technology</h2>
<p>Netflix has dropped out of a bidding war to acquire Warner Bros, which clears the way for Paramount to win the takeover battle. This decision marks a significant shift in the entertainment industry, signaling a consolidation trend among major companies.</p>
<p>In the tech sector, Jack Dorsey’s company Block has announced thousands of job cuts as it focuses more on artificial intelligence (AI). Dorsey stated that he believes many other companies will follow this path within the next year, pointing to a broader trend of AI reshaping the workforce and corporate strategies.</p>
<h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>China has removed nine military officials ahead of its key political event known as the Two Sessions meeting. The government has not provided an official reason for these removals. This move occurs at a sensitive political moment and may signal shifts within China's military or political strategy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cuba faces what some describe as the biggest threat to its revolution in decades. The country is dealing with worsening internal crises, including blackouts and worsening economic conditions. Emergency aid is being deployed, but experts question whether the revolutionary government can withstand these growing challenges, which could lead to significant changes within the country.</p>
