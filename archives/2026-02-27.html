    <h2>South Asia Tensions Escalate</h2>
<p>Pakistan’s defence minister announced that Pakistan is in an "open war" with Afghanistan following recent bombings by Pakistan in Afghan territory. These strikes mark the most serious escalation in ongoing clashes between the neighbouring countries, which had been maintaining a fragile ceasefire since October. The physical damage from the latest attacks has not been fully reported, but the situation signals worsening relations, raising concerns about future stability and the potential for broader conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict Impacts African Nationals</h2>
<p>The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of at least 55 Ghanaians, according to a Ghanaian minister. This is the highest confirmed death toll reported from a single African country involved in or affected by the conflict. The figures highlight the international human cost of the war and underscore the broad range of countries impacted by the fighting.</p>
<h2>India Strengthens Ties with Israel Amid Criticism</h2>
<p>India and Israel have pledged to enhance cooperation in defence and technology sectors during a recent visit. However, this move has drawn criticism from Indian opposition parties, who argue the government is neglecting the Palestinian cause. This development reflects India’s evolving foreign relationships and may influence regional dynamics in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Spain’s Opposition Calls for Ex-Monarch’s Return</h2>
<p>The leader of Spain’s main opposition party has called for the return of former King Juan Carlos from exile. At 88 years old, the former monarch is urged to spend his remaining years with dignity in Spain. This call adds to ongoing discussions about the ex-monarch’s legacy and the monarchy’s role in Spanish society.</p>
<h2>Major Corporate Takeover in Entertainment Industry</h2>
<p>Paramount is set to acquire Warner Bros in a deal worth $111 billion, following Netflix’s withdrawal from the bidding war. This development clears the path for Paramount to finalize one of the largest entertainment industry mergers to date. The deal is expected to reshape the competitive landscape of streaming and content production.</p>
<h2>International Security Concerns Rise Near French Naval Assets</h2>
<p>Sweden’s prime minister described a recent incident where a drone was jammed near a French aircraft carrier as serious but not unexpected. The drone interference is believed to have been conducted by Russian actors, noted for similar behaviour elsewhere. This event highlights ongoing tensions and security challenges around military assets in contested areas.</p>
