    <h2>South Asia Tensions Rise Between Pakistan and Afghanistan</h2>
<p>Pakistan’s defence minister has declared that the country is in "open war" with Afghanistan following recent Pakistani airstrikes. These attacks come after several months of clashes despite a fragile ceasefire agreement reached in October 2025. The bombings mark a significant escalation in the already tense relations between the neighboring countries, though the exact physical damage remains unclear. This development threatens regional stability and may complicate ongoing peace efforts.</p>
<h2>Conflict Impact on Ghanaian Citizens in Ukraine</h2>
<p>The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of at least 55 Ghanaians, according to Ghana’s government minister. This figure represents the highest number of confirmed casualties from a single African nation involved in the Ukraine-Russia war. The loss highlights the broader international impact of the conflict and underscores the dangers faced by foreign nationals in the region.</p>
<h2>Indian Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been cleared of corruption charges by an Indian court. Kejriwal had been arrested in March 2024, shortly before India’s general election, spending several months in jail during the investigation. This legal decision could influence political dynamics in India, especially regarding his public image and future role.</p>
<h2>India and Israel Strengthen Bilateral Ties</h2>
<p>India and Israel have pledged to enhance cooperation, particularly in defence and technology sectors. However, the announcement has drawn criticism from opposition parties in India, who accuse the government of neglecting the Palestinian cause. This diplomatic move may lead to shifts in regional alliances and influence India’s foreign policy discourse.</p>
<h2>Media Industry Shakeup: Paramount to Acquire Warner Bros</h2>
<p>Paramount is poised to acquire Warner Bros in a deal valued at $111 billion. This development follows Netflix’s withdrawal from the bidding competition, effectively clearing the way for Paramount’s takeover. The consolidation could reshape the entertainment industry landscape, affecting content production and distribution strategies worldwide.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns Near French Naval Operations</h2>
<p>Sweden’s defence minister indicated that a drone jammed near a French aircraft carrier probably has ties to a Russian naval vessel operating in the area. The suggestion of a "strong link" between the drone and Russia raises concerns about increasing surveillance or interference activities near European naval forces. This incident reflects ongoing security tensions in the region and may prompt heightened military vigilance.</p>
