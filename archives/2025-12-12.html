    <h2>Europe and Ukraine</h2>
<p>The European Union has agreed to indefinitely freeze Russian funds that have been held since the start of Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine nearly four years ago. This decision comes as Ukraine faces a severe cash shortage and estimates it will need around €135.7 billion over the next two years to manage the ongoing conflict and its aftermath. This financial move aims to support Ukraine’s continued needs, including a forthcoming loan plan backed by the EU.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine reported that a Turkish car ferry was damaged in an attack at a Ukrainian port. Ukraine’s president blamed Russia for the strike. In response, Turkey has called for a halt to strikes targeting shipping and ports to protect maritime traffic and commerce in the region.</p>
<h2>Cybersecurity and Diplomatic Tensions</h2>
<p>Germany has formally accused Russia of conducting a cyber-attack on its air traffic control systems. Alongside this, Germany has also raised concerns about Russian attempts at electoral interference. The Russian ambassador was summoned to address these serious allegations, highlighting growing tensions between the two countries over cyber operations and political security.</p>
<h2>International Conflicts and Agreements</h2>
<p>After days of fighting along their shared border, Thailand and Cambodia appear to have agreed to a ceasefire, according to an announcement made by Donald Trump. Neither country’s leaders have publicly confirmed this agreement yet. The situation follows weeks of hostilities that had raised regional concerns.</p>
<p>Separately, Eritrea has announced its departure from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad), a regional bloc. Eritrea cited being targeted by the organization and claimed that Igad is no longer fulfilling its founding principles. This exit adds to existing tensions between Eritrea and neighboring Ethiopia.</p>
<h2>Social and Human Rights Developments</h2>
<p>In Iran, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, a well-known women’s rights activist, has been arrested by security services during a memorial event, according to her supporters. The arrest of such a prominent human rights figure draws attention to ongoing issues concerning civil rights and government repression in Iran.</p>
<p>In France, farmers have staged protests and blockades in response to the culling of a herd affected by a cow disease. The demonstrations have taken place across several regions, reflecting rural discontent with government measures that affect livestock and farming livelihoods.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>At The Game Awards, the French role-playing video game Clair Obscur dominated the night with nine wins, including the prestigious game of the year award. The ceremony celebrated outstanding achievements in video gaming, highlighting the growing cultural impact of the industry.</p>
<p>In a more somber moment from the world of entertainment, footage has surfaced showing singer Taylor Swift breaking down in tears backstage after meeting families affected by a recent attack in the UK. The encounter took place during her ongoing world tour and underscored the emotional connection between artists and communities affected by tragedy.</p>
