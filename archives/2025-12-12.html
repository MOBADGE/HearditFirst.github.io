    <h2>Europe and Ukraine: Financial Aid and Conflict Impacts</h2>
<p>The European Union has backed a plan to indefinitely freeze Russian assets to support Ukraine financially amid ongoing conflict. Kyiv is facing severe cash shortages due to nearly four years of full-scale war and urgently needs approximately €135.7 billion over the next two years to sustain its economy and military efforts. This move is part of broader international support aimed at helping Ukraine cope with the prolonged crisis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, conflict effects escalated with a strike on a Ukrainian port damaging a Turkish car ferry. Ukraine's president blamed Russia for the attack, while Turkey called for a suspension of strikes on shipping and ports to avoid further disruptions and damage to maritime trade routes in the region.</p>
<h2>Cybersecurity and Diplomacy: Germany-Russia Tensions</h2>
<p>Germany has accused Russia of carrying out a cyber-attack targeting the country's air traffic control systems. In addition to this, there were attempts at interfering in German elections. As a response, the Russian ambassador was summoned to address these allegations. This development adds strain to already tense relations between Russia and Western countries over various geopolitical conflicts.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Activism: Arrest in Iran</h2>
<p>Narges Mohammadi, a women’s rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 2023, was reportedly arrested by Iranian security forces during a memorial event. Her supporters have voiced concern over the arrest, which highlights ongoing challenges in Iran related to activism and the state’s response to dissent.</p>
<h2>Social Unrest in France: Farmers’ Protests</h2>
<p>In France, farmers have staged protests across several regions following a controversial cull of cattle affected by a disease. The culling, carried out by veterinary authorities, has sparked anger among farming communities. The demonstrations aim to challenge government and veterinary policies, reflecting tensions over agricultural disease management and rural livelihoods.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment: Game Awards Highlights</h2>
<p>At The Game Awards, the French role-playing game *Clair Obscur* emerged as the biggest winner, securing nine awards including game of the year. The event showcased various prizes and announcements, spotlighting significant achievements in the gaming industry and the growing global influence of French game development.</p>
<h2>Regional Politics: Eritrea Leaves IGAD</h2>
<p>Eritrea announced it is quitting the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a regional bloc, citing accusations that IGAD has targeted Eritrea and failed to uphold its founding principles. This decision comes amid rising tensions in the Horn of Africa, particularly strained relations with Ethiopia, and could impact regional cooperation and stability.</p>
