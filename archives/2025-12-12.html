    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 12, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Cybersecurity Concerns</h2>
<p>Germany has accused Russia of carrying out a cyber attack that disrupted air traffic control systems. The incident is also linked to attempts by Russian actors to interfere in Germany’s upcoming elections. In response, German officials summoned the Russian ambassador to address the allegations. This development highlights ongoing tensions related to cybersecurity and election security in Europe. The situation may lead to further diplomatic actions or increased protective measures as the election approaches.</p>
<h2>Middle East Peace Efforts Stall</h2>
<p>Efforts led by the United States to advance a peace plan for Gaza, proposed by former US President Donald Trump, are facing significant challenges. Washington is trying to encourage both Israel and Hamas to agree to a second phase of negotiations, but progress has been slow. Meanwhile, Gazans continue to endure hardships amid the ongoing conflict. The stalled negotiations underline the complexity of achieving peace in the region and the urgent need for solutions to improve conditions on the ground.</p>
<h2>Thai Political Developments</h2>
<p>Thailand’s Prime Minister has dissolved the country’s parliament, stating the move is intended to “return power to the people.” This decision follows the loss of support from the largest opposition bloc for Anutin Charnvirakul, a prominent political figure. The dissolution will trigger new elections, marking a significant moment in Thailand’s political landscape and potentially reshaping the balance of power.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Entertainment Highlights</h2>
<p>The French role-playing video game Clair Obscur dominated at The Game Awards, winning nine prizes including Game of the Year. The event celebrated creativity and innovation in gaming, drawing attention to the growing influence of French game developers.</p>
<p>In music, Taylor Swift was seen breaking down in tears after meeting families affected by a recent attack in the UK during her world tour. The emotional moment was captured in backstage footage, reflecting the deep impact of connecting with survivors.</p>
<p>Additionally, Swiss singer Nemo announced plans to return their Eurovision trophy in protest against Israel’s participation in the contest. Nemo expressed concerns about a conflict between Israel’s involvement and the values Eurovision promotes, pointing to ongoing political sensitivities around the event.</p>
<h2>Science and Culture</h2>
<p>The UK can expect a spectacular meteor shower this weekend as the Geminid meteor shower reaches its peak. With favorable dark skies, weather permitting, many people may have the chance to witness this natural display.</p>
<p>Separately, in Colombia, a remarkable cathedral built 180 meters underground has drawn interest. Inspired by miners in the 1930s who created makeshift altars to pray for safety, this underground cathedral reflects a unique intersection of faith and mining history.</p>
<h2>Business and Social Media News</h2>
<p>In response to backlash over cultural appropriation, Prada announced it will launch a $930 pair of Kolhapuri sandals made in India. The luxury brand’s decision comes months after it faced criticism for allegedly copying sandal designs created by Indian artisans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reddit has initiated a High Court challenge against Australia’s new social media ban for children. The company argues that the policy raises serious concerns about Australians’ privacy and political rights. This legal action could have implications for social media regulation and digital rights in Australia.</p>
