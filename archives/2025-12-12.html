    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 12, 2025</div>
    <h2>Middle East Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>Efforts to advance a peace plan proposed by Donald Trump to address the conflict between Israel and Hamas are facing significant challenges. Washington is working to move both sides into the next phase of negotiations, but progress is slow. As the stalemate continues, people living in Gaza are experiencing ongoing hardships. The situation underscores the complexity of brokering peace in the region and the urgency for diplomatic breakthroughs to alleviate civilian suffering.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>In Indiana, Republicans have resisted proposals for a new voting map, going against President Donald Trump's recommendations. Some lawmakers involved in rejecting the map have reported receiving death threats and other forms of intimidation related to their vote. Meanwhile, Trump issued an executive order aimed at preventing states from implementing their own artificial intelligence regulations. This order prompted a strong reaction from California Governor Gavin Newsom, reflecting tensions between federal and state authorities on technology governance.</p>
<h2>International Security in West Africa</h2>
<p>Approximately 200 soldiers from West African countries are currently stationed in Benin following a failed coup attempt. This is the first official disclosure regarding the number of foreign troops deployed to assist Beninese authorities in stabilizing the situation after the mutiny was suppressed. The deployment highlights regional cooperation efforts to maintain security and prevent political instability.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime News</h2>
<p>Matt Wright, a former star of a Netflix series known for crocodile wrangling, has been sentenced to jail after being found guilty of tampering with evidence related to a fatal helicopter crash in 2022. In financial crime news, cryptocurrency figure Do Kwon received a sentence linked to an extensive $40 billion stablecoin collapse. Kwon admitted to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud in August and expressed remorse for his role in the fraud.</p>
<h2>Culture and Social Media</h2>
<p>The French role-playing game Clair Obscur dominated The Game Awards, securing nine wins including the prestigious Game of the Year title. The game was also recognized for its music and performance elements. In a related cultural event, Swiss singer Nemo, winner of Eurovision, announced plans to return their trophy in protest over Israel's participation in the contest, citing a belief that it conflicts with Eurovision's values. On the digital front, Reddit has launched a High Court challenge against Australia's social media ban targeting children, raising concerns about its effects on privacy and political rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Energy and Global Relations</h2>
<p>Venezuela has accused Donald Trump of wanting to control its oil resources. However, the reality is complicated by Venezuela's sharply reduced oil production, making any quick restoration of its former production capacity difficult. This situation adds complexity to international energy dynamics and discussions about resource control.</p>
