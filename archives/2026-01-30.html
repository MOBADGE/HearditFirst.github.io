    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The United States is increasing its military presence in the Gulf amid rising tensions with Iran. The US president stated he has communicated to Iran that the country must meet two conditions to avoid military action, noting that it "would be great" if force were unnecessary. In related developments, the European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list, citing Tehran's violent suppression of protesters as motivation for this move. These actions highlight escalating international pressure on Iran and reflect concerns about stability in the region.</p>
<p>In West Africa, suspected jihadists attacked an airport near Niger's capital. According to Niger's defence ministry, 20 attackers were killed and four military personnel were injured during the incident. This attack underscores ongoing security challenges faced by the region.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Politics and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>The US president and his sons have filed a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the US Treasury, seeking $10 billion in damages. The lawsuit follows the public release of their tax information, which they allege was leaked unlawfully to the media. This case adds another chapter to ongoing disputes revolving around tax transparency and privacy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, political negotiations in Washington have yielded a deal to continue funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at current levels for two more weeks. This temporary measure provides Congress additional time to finalize a longer-term funding agreement for the agency.</p>
<h2>US Immigration and Local Government Relations</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, federal immigration agents could scale back their operations if local officials agree to increased cooperation, according to an official leading the immigration efforts. The approach aims to make the operations more "targeted" and seeks to ease tensions both within the city and on Capitol Hill. This development reflects ongoing negotiation efforts to balance immigration enforcement with local governance concerns.</p>
<h2>Global Infrastructure and Geopolitics</h2>
<p>Panama has canceled contracts with a Hong Kong-based firm related to port operations at the Panama Canal. This decision follows comments by the US president about the United States "taking the Panama Canal back" from China, indicating strategic interests in controlling this vital international waterway. The move highlights ongoing geopolitical competition involving major global powers over critical infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Culture and Legacy</h2>
<p>In cultural news, Nigerian musician Fela Kuti has become the first African artist to receive the Grammys Lifetime Achievement Award. The honor is being bestowed posthumously nearly 30 years after his death, recognizing his enduring influence on music worldwide. This award spotlights the global reach of African cultural contributions.</p>
