    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 30, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>The United Nations is facing a serious financial crisis, with Secretary-General António Guterres warning that the organization could run out of money by July if member states do not pay their outstanding fees. This would put the UN’s operations and global initiatives at risk, underscoring ongoing challenges in funding international organizations.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, the Syrian government has reached a deal with Kurdish-led forces for the gradual integration of Kurdish military units and administrative bodies into the Syrian state. This agreement marks a significant development in Syria’s complex conflict, potentially altering the balance of power and governance within the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, South Africa and Israel have expelled each other's envoys in a diplomatic dispute. South Africa accused the Israeli envoy of insulting its President Ramaphosa, while Israel described the expulsion as “baseless.” This diplomatic row highlights ongoing tensions between the two countries.</p>
<h2>United States</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has nominated economist Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve. Warsh, aged 55, was previously considered for the Fed chair position during Trump’s first term. His appointment will be closely watched as the Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in shaping US monetary policy and economic stability.</p>
<p>In legal news, Trump and his sons have launched a $10 billion lawsuit against the IRS and US Treasury. The suit responds to leaked tax information that was published in the media, marking another chapter in Trump’s ongoing legal and political battles.</p>
<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon was arrested during an anti-ICE protest at a church in Minnesota. Lemon said his presence was part of his journalistic work covering the protests. The incident raises questions about the role of journalists in covering politically sensitive demonstrations.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>There was a quieter night in Ukraine as Russian strikes on Kyiv paused temporarily. US President Donald Trump said that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attack Ukrainian cities and that the pause in attacks was requested by the US, partly due to cold weather conditions. The pause is set to last until February 1, offering a brief respite amid ongoing tensions.</p>
<p>However, not all conflicts have seen a reduction in violence. The United Nations reported that at least 170 people were killed in air strikes during Myanmar’s recent election period. Credible sources identified over 400 strikes, many widely condemned internationally, highlighting the ongoing instability and humanitarian concerns in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Judicial Developments</h2>
<p>A judge ruled that Luigi Mangione, who faces murder charges, will not be subjected to the death penalty if convicted. The judge dismissed two federal counts against the 27-year-old, though state-level murder charges remain active. This decision affects the potential sentencing and legal proceedings moving forward.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Punishments</h2>
<p>In Indonesia, a couple in Aceh province was caned 140 times for violations related to sex and alcohol offenses. Caning is a controversial and common form of punishment under Islamic law in the region. This case sheds light on the tensions between local legal traditions and international human rights perspectives.</p>
