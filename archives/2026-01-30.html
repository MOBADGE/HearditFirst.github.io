    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 30, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in several regions, with notable developments reported today. In Myanmar, the United Nations highlighted a severe escalation of violence during the country’s recent election period. At least 170 people were killed in air strikes amid over 400 reported attacks, drawing widespread international criticism.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, there was a quieter night following a reported pause in strikes on Kyiv, reportedly requested by Russia until 1 February. US President Donald Trump indicated this pause was influenced by cold weather conditions and also expressed the view that Russian forces led by Vladimir Putin would not target Ukrainian cities further.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran’s stance on its missile and defense systems continues to cause concern. While Tehran has stated it will never negotiate on these matters, President Trump said Iran prefers reaching a deal rather than facing military action. This leaves some uncertainty about the prospects for future talks.</p>
<h2>Economic and Institutional Challenges</h2>
<p>The United Nations is facing a significant financial crisis. Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the organization risks an “imminent financial collapse,” with the possibility of running out of funds by July. This situation is largely attributed to member countries failing to pay their dues, which could impact the UN's operations and its global initiatives.</p>
<p>In the United States, President Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh, a 55-year-old economist previously considered for the Federal Reserve chairmanship during Trump’s first term, to lead the US Federal Reserve. This appointment is closely watched as it could influence economic policy and market confidence.</p>
<h2>Legal and Civil Rights Developments</h2>
<p>A judge ruled that Luigi Mangione, aged 27, will not face the death penalty if convicted. While two federal counts against him have been dismissed, he still faces state murder charges, keeping the case active in the legal system.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, a civil rights investigation has been opened following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, according to the deputy attorney general, who described the inquiry as standard procedure. This comes amid ongoing attention to police-related shootings and community responses.</p>
<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon faces charges related to his presence at an anti-ICE protest held in a Minnesota church. Lemon stated that he was fulfilling his role as a journalist reporting on the event, underscoring the complex intersection of media coverage and legal actions in protest situations.</p>
<h2>Regional Politics</h2>
<p>In West Africa, Mamadou Hawa Gassama, a Malian lawmaker, has been jailed in Ivory Coast for insulting President Alassane Ouattara. Prosecutors accused Gassama of describing Ouattara as a “tyrant” and “an enemy of Mali,” highlighting regional political tensions between the neighboring countries.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The entertainment world mourns the loss of Catherine O’Hara, an Emmy-winning actress known for her roles in "Schitt's Creek" and "Home Alone." She died at her home in Los Angeles at the age of 71 after a brief illness. Her passing marks a significant moment for fans and colleagues in the arts.</p>
