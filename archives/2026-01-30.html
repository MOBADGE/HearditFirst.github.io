    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>The United Nations is facing a serious financial crisis, with Secretary-General António Guterres warning that the organization could run out of money by July due to unpaid member fees. This shortfall threatens the UN’s ability to carry out its global operations effectively. In the same realm, tensions involving Iran continue as Tehran maintains it will not negotiate on its missile and defense systems, though it says it remains open to talks. Former US President Donald Trump has stated that Iran prefers making a deal rather than facing military action.</p>
<h2>US Political and Legal News</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has selected economist Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve. Warsh, 55, had previously been considered for the Federal Reserve Chair position during Trump’s first term, indicating a return to familiar territory for the former president. Meanwhile, Trump and his sons have filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the IRS and US Treasury. They are seeking damages following the leak of their tax information to the media.</p>
<p>On the legal front, former CNN host Don Lemon faces charges connected to his reporting on an anti-ICE protest at a Minnesota church. Lemon states he was performing his duties as a journalist. Additionally, a judge has ruled that Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty if convicted, after dismissing two federal counts against him; however, he continues to face state murder charges.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine experienced a quieter night amid ongoing conflict, as Russia reportedly agreed to a pause in strikes on Kyiv until February 1. Trump said this pause was requested due to cold weather conditions, and he indicated that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not attack Ukrainian cities at this time. In Minnesota, a civil rights investigation was launched following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti. The deputy attorney general described the inquiry as a “standard investigation,” reflecting the authorities' approach to the case.</p>
<p>In West Africa, Mamadou Hawa Gassama, a lawmaker from Mali, has been jailed in Ivory Coast. Prosecutors say he insulted Ivory Coast’s President Alassane Ouattara by calling him a "tyrant" and "an enemy of Mali," highlighting regional political tensions.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict Impact</h2>
<p>The United Nations has reported severe violence in Myanmar during a recent election, stating that at least 170 people have been killed in air strikes. These attacks, which have drawn widespread criticism, reportedly involved over 400 strikes based on reports from credible sources. This situation underscores the ongoing instability and humanitarian challenges in Myanmar.</p>
