    <h2>International Organization Faces Financial Crisis</h2>
<p>The United Nations is facing a serious financial challenge, according to Secretary-General António Guterres. He warned that the organization could run out of money by July due to many member countries not paying their dues. This shortfall threatens the UN’s ability to fund its various programs and operations worldwide. If the funding gap is not addressed, it could impact global efforts on peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, and development projects supported by the UN.</p>
<h2>Changes in U.S. Federal Reserve Leadership</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has selected economist Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve. Warsh is 55 years old and was previously considered for the Fed chair position during Trump’s earlier term. The Federal Reserve plays a key role in setting monetary policy, influencing interest rates, and guiding the US economy. Warsh’s appointment, if confirmed, may signal changes in the Fed’s approach to managing inflation and economic growth.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Conflict-Related Violence in Myanmar and Ukraine</h2>
<p>The United Nations reported that at least 170 people were killed during air strikes tied to Myanmar’s recent election period, with over 400 strikes documented by credible sources. The violence has drawn international criticism as the country struggles with political instability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Ukraine, there has been a quieter night after strikes on Kyiv paused. The pause reportedly came at the request of the US president, Donald Trump, allegedly because of cold weather conditions. Russia agreed to pause attacks on the capital until February 1. Trump has also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not target Ukrainian cities, which could suggest a temporary de-escalation in the ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>A judge ruled that Luigi Mangione, 27, will not face the death penalty if convicted in a serious criminal case, dismissing two federal counts against him. However, he continues to face murder charges at the state level.</p>
<p>In Ivory Coast, Mamadou Hawa Gassama, a lawmaker from Mali, has been jailed after prosecutors said he insulted President Alassane Ouattara by calling him a “tyrant” and “an enemy of Mali.” The arrest highlights tensions between political figures and limits on speech in the region.</p>
<h2>Economic Trends: Gold Prices</h2>
<p>Gold prices recently rose to record levels before experiencing a decline. Despite this fall, multiple factors are still driving investor interest in gold as a safe-haven asset. These factors include global economic uncertainty and changing market conditions. Gold remains an important asset for those seeking to protect wealth during volatile times.</p>
