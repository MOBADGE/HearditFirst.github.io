    <h2>International Organization Funding Crisis</h2>
<p>The United Nations is facing a serious financial challenge that could threaten its operations. António Guterres warned that the UN might run out of money by July unless member countries pay their outstanding fees. This could lead to an "imminent financial collapse" of the organization, highlighting the need for timely contributions to sustain its work worldwide.</p>
<h2>U.S. Federal Reserve Leadership Change</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has chosen economist Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve. Warsh, 55, was previously considered for the Fed chair position during Trump’s first term and brings experience in economic policy. This selection is an important step for the future of U.S. monetary policy and could influence economic direction in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Diplomacy in Syria and Myanmar</h2>
<p>In Syria, the government has reached a deal to gradually integrate Kurdish-led forces and their administration into the Syrian state. This marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict, potentially stabilizing the region and altering power dynamics within the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Myanmar, the UN reported a high number of air strikes, with "credible sources" counting more than 400 attacks during a recent election period. At least 170 people were killed in these strikes. The international community widely criticized the violence, underscoring the ongoing humanitarian and political crisis in Myanmar.</p>
<h2>Regional Diplomatic Tensions</h2>
<p>South Africa and Israel are involved in a diplomatic dispute after expelling each other’s envoys. South Africa accused the Israeli envoy of insulting President Ramaphosa, while Israel dismissed the expulsion as "baseless." This diplomatic row could affect relations between the two countries and reflects broader regional political sensitivities.</p>
<h2>Legal Actions and Protests in the United States</h2>
<p>There have been notable legal and protest-related events involving President Donald Trump. Trump and his sons have filed a lawsuit against the IRS and the US Treasury, seeking $10 billion in damages over the leak of their tax information to the media. Additionally, former CNN host Don Lemon was arrested while covering anti-ICE protests at a church in Minnesota. Lemon stated that he was acting in his role as a journalist reporting on the events.</p>
<h2>Justice and Punishment in Indonesia and the United States</h2>
<p>A federal judge ruled that Luigi Mangione, 27, will not face the death penalty if convicted, dismissing a federal murder charge against him.</p>
<p>Separately, an Indonesian couple in Aceh province received 140 caning blows for sex and alcohol-related offenses, punishments carried out under Islamic law. Caning remains a common but controversial form of punishment in the region, reflecting ongoing debates about human rights and local laws.</p>
