    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 30, 2026</div>
    <h2>Protests and Legal Actions</h2>
<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon was arrested during anti-ICE protests at a church in Minnesota. Lemon said he was simply doing his job as a journalist reporting on the event. Meanwhile, in the United States, Donald Trump and his sons have filed a lawsuit against the IRS and the Treasury Department seeking $10 billion in damages. The suit follows the leak of tax information related to Trump and his family.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>In Syria, the government has reached a deal with Kurdish-led forces to gradually integrate them and their administration into the Syrian state. This represents a significant step in addressing long-standing territorial and political conflicts in the region. In related news from the Gulf, the US president has stated that it "would be great" if military force against Iran could be avoided. He said Iran must take two unspecified actions to avoid such intervention, as the US continues to build up military forces in the area.</p>
<h2>International Diplomatic Moves</h2>
<p>South Africa has expelled Ariel Siedman, an Israeli envoy, citing "violations of diplomatic norms." Siedman has been given 72 hours to leave the country. In Central America, Panama has voided canal port contracts held by a Hong Kong-based firm. This move follows previous claims by Donald Trump that the US was reclaiming control of the Panama Canal from China.</p>
<h2>Conflict Zones and Violence</h2>
<p>Ukraine experienced a quieter night recently, with Russia reportedly requesting a pause in strikes on Kyiv until 1 February. The US president attributed this temporary halt to cold weather. In Myanmar, the United Nations reported that at least 170 people were killed in air strikes during recent elections, with credible sources identifying more than 400 strikes in total during the period. These figures highlight ongoing violence in the country amid political turmoil.</p>
<h2>Political Changes in Africa</h2>
<p>In Burkina Faso, the ruling junta has announced a ban on all political parties, claiming the multiparty system was causing division among citizens. This marks a significant shift away from democratic processes in the country.</p>
<h2>Social Issues in Indonesia</h2>
<p>In Aceh province, Indonesia, a couple was sentenced to be caned 140 times each for sex outside marriage and alcohol offenses. Caning is a common but contentious form of punishment under Islamic law in the region, sparking ongoing debates about human rights and legal practices.</p>
