    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 30, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Governance and Finance</h2>
<p>The United Nations is facing a serious financial crisis, with Secretary-General António Guterres warning that the organization could run out of money by July. This situation arises from member states not paying their dues on time. The potential collapse of the UN's finances could impact its global operations and peacekeeping efforts. If the financial situation does not improve, urgent measures may be needed to secure funding and maintain the organization's functions.</p>
<h2>US Economic Policy</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has chosen economist Kevin Warsh to head the US Federal Reserve. Warsh, aged 55, was previously considered for the Fed chair position during Trump's first term. His appointment signals the administration's direction for monetary policy, which will be closely watched by markets and economists. Warsh's leadership will influence decisions on interest rates and economic stability at a time of global uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in High-Profile Cases</h2>
<p>A judge has ruled that Luigi Mangione, 27, will not face the death penalty if convicted, after dismissing two federal counts against him. However, Mangione still faces state-level murder charges. This ruling narrows the legal consequences he faces but leaves the outcome of the state case pending. Additionally, former CNN host Don Lemon faces charges related to his presence at an anti-ICE protest at a Minnesota church. Lemon maintains he was fulfilling his role as a journalist by reporting on the event. These cases highlight ongoing legal and political tensions in the US.</p>
<h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high regarding Iran's missile and defence programs. Donald Trump has stated that Iran prefers to negotiate rather than face military action, although Tehran insists it will not compromise on its missile capabilities. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, there has been a quieter night in the conflict, with Russia reportedly agreeing to pause strikes on Kyiv until February 1 at the request of the US president. This pause was attributed to cold weather conditions, reducing immediate threats to Ukrainian cities.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Civil Unrest</h2>
<p>The UN reported that at least 170 people were killed in air strikes during Myanmar’s recent election period, with more than 400 strikes verified from credible sources. This has drawn widespread criticism of the violence surrounding the elections. In the US, a civil rights investigation has been launched into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, described as a “standard investigation” by the deputy attorney general. These developments underscore ongoing issues of violence and human rights concerns in different parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Controversies</h2>
<p>Mamadou Hawa Gassama, a lawmaker from Mali, has been jailed in Ivory Coast after prosecutors said he insulted the country's president, Alassane Ouattara, calling him a "tyrant" and "an enemy of Mali." This case reflects regional political sensitivities and legal responses to dissent. In the US, Donald Trump and his sons have filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the IRS and Treasury Department. The case concerns the alleged leaking of their tax information to the media, further fueling ongoing disputes over privacy and official conduct.</p>
