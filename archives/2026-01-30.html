    <h2>Europe and Iran Relations</h2>
<p>The European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its list of terrorist organizations. This decision came as a response to Iran's violent crackdown on protesters within the country. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the EU’s stance against Tehran’s actions. This move could deepen tensions between the EU and Iran, potentially leading to further diplomatic and economic consequences.</p>
<h2>Security Incident in Niger</h2>
<p>Near Niger’s capital, suspected jihadists launched an attack on a local airport. According to Niger's defense ministry, four military personnel were injured during the incident. The military reportedly killed 20 attackers in response. This event highlights ongoing security challenges in the region and may prompt increased military or international efforts to stabilize the area.</p>
<h2>US Political Developments on Funding</h2>
<p>Republicans and Democrats in the United States have reached a temporary agreement to maintain funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at its current level for two more weeks. This deal allows both parties extra time to negotiate a more comprehensive funding package. The agreement helps avoid an immediate funding lapse for the agency, which is critical for national security and border management.</p>
<h2>Legal Drama Over Luigi Mangione</h2>
<p>A man has been accused of impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murder. The individual falsely claimed he possessed paperwork “signed by a judge” to jail officers, according to an official complaint. This unusual incident underlines concerns about legal impersonation and its potential to disrupt the justice process.</p>
<h2>Venezuela’s Oil Towns and Economic Hopes</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, towns once booming from oil production now lie neglected, characterized by rusting pumps and rigs. Residents of these oil ghost towns are now hoping that new investment plans from former US President Donald Trump might help revive their local economies. While the specifics of the plan or its potential impacts remain to be seen, these communities are looking for opportunities to rebuild after years of economic downturn.</p>
