    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 30, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Organizations</h2>
<p>The United Nations is facing a severe financial challenge, with Secretary-General António Guterres warning that the organization risks an "imminent financial collapse." Due to unpaid membership fees from some member countries, the UN could run out of money by July. This situation raises concerns about the UN’s ability to continue funding its operations and peacekeeping missions, which may require urgent action from member states to resolve.</p>
<h2>United States Politics and Economy</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve. Warsh, a 55-year-old economist, was previously considered for the Fed chair during Trump's first term. The Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in shaping US monetary policy, so Warsh's nomination may signal certain economic priorities. Additionally, Trump and his sons have filed a lawsuit against the IRS and US Treasury, seeking $10 billion in damages. The suit is in response to leaked tax information published by the media, highlighting ongoing disputes over financial transparency and privacy.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, there has been a quieter night amid ongoing conflict with Russia. Russian officials stated that the US president requested a pause in strikes on Kyiv until 1 February, reportedly due to cold weather conditions. Meanwhile, a civil rights investigation has been launched into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. The Deputy Attorney General described this as a standard investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>
<h2>Legal and Justice Developments</h2>
<p>Luigi Mangione, 27, will not face the death penalty if convicted, following a judge’s dismissal of two federal counts against him. He still faces state-level murder charges, indicating that legal proceedings will continue. In Ivory Coast, Mamadou Hawa Gassama, a lawmaker from Mali, was jailed for insulting the Ivorian president, Alassane Ouattara, whom he called a "tyrant" and "an enemy of Mali." This event highlights ongoing tensions in West Africa regarding political expression and diplomatic relationships.</p>
<h2>International Conflicts and Agreements</h2>
<p>In Myanmar, the United Nations reported that at least 170 people were killed in air strikes during the country’s recent election period, with over 400 strikes reportedly recorded by credible sources. The violence has drawn widespread international criticism. On another front, the Syrian government has reached a deal with Kurdish-led forces. This agreement aims at the gradual integration of Kurdish fighters and their administration into the Syrian state structure, potentially reshaping the region’s political landscape.</p>
<h2>Social and Media Events</h2>
<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon was arrested while covering anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests at a church in Minnesota. Lemon stated that he was performing his duties as a journalist reporting on the events. This incident raises questions about press freedom and the interaction between media workers and law enforcement during protests.</p>
