    <h2>Europe Takes Action Against Iran’s Revolutionary Guards</h2>
<p>The European Union has officially designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization. This decision, announced by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, comes in response to Iran's violent crackdown on recent protests within the country. By adding the Revolutionary Guards to the EU’s terrorist list, European leaders signal increased condemnation of Tehran’s tactics and aim to put further pressure on the Iranian regime. This move could lead to tighter sanctions and affect diplomatic relations, underscoring Europe’s stance on human rights and security concerns in the region.</p>
<h2>US Political Deal Prevents Department Shutdown</h2>
<p>In the United States, Republican and Democratic lawmakers have agreed on a temporary funding package for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The funding will continue at current levels for two weeks, giving both sides more time to negotiate a longer-term budget deal. According to US media, this agreement, confirmed by the US president, prevents a potential shutdown that could have disrupted the agency’s operations. The ongoing talks highlight the challenges in reaching consensus on government spending but also reflect a willingness to compromise to avoid immediate disruptions.</p>
<h2>Security Incident Highlights Risks in Niger</h2>
<p>Near Niger’s capital, suspected jihadist attackers targeted a local airport, injuring four military personnel. The country’s defence ministry reported that 20 of the attackers were killed in the ensuing clashes. This incident underscores ongoing security challenges faced by Niger and the broader Sahel region, which continues to grapple with militant violence. The attack highlights the fragile security environment and the need for continued efforts to stabilize the area and protect key infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Fraud Attempt to Free Accused Killer in the US</h2>
<p>In a separate story from the US, authorities have accused a man of impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Luigi Mangione, a man accused of murder. The alleged impersonator reportedly told jail officers he had documents signed by a judge authorizing Mangione’s release. This fraudulent act has been formally complained about by law enforcement. The case serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by the justice system in preventing attempts to undermine legal processes.</p>
<h2>Venezuelan Oil Towns Look to US Investment for Revival</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, several once-prosperous oil towns, now marked by decaying infrastructure such as rusted pumps and rigs, are hopeful that a new investment plan originating from the US will rejuvenate their declining fortunes. The local communities, once dependent on thriving oil production, see the potential for economic recovery and revitalization through renewed foreign investment. This situation highlights the ongoing economic difficulties in Venezuela’s oil sector and the reliance on external capital to stimulate growth and job creation.</p>
