    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 30, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>
<p>The Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces have reached an agreement to gradually integrate Kurdish forces and administration into the Syrian state. This deal aims to enhance stability and cooperation in a region long marked by conflict.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions between South Africa and Israel have escalated after both countries expelled each other's envoys. South Africa accused the Israeli envoy of insulting President Ramaphosa, while Israel dismissed the expulsion as "baseless." This diplomatic row could affect their bilateral relations going forward.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, a quieter night was reported amid ongoing tensions with Russia. The US president reportedly requested a pause in strikes on Kyiv until February 1, citing cold weather as the reason. Russia confirmed this request, and US President Donald Trump said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin would not attack Ukraine’s cities during this time.</p>
<h2>United Nations Financial Warning and Myanmar Election Violence</h2>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres issued a warning that the UN faces an "imminent financial collapse," with the organisation potentially running out of funds by July. The crisis stems from unpaid fees by member states, which jeopardises the UN's operations and ability to respond to global challenges.</p>
<p>In Myanmar, the United Nations reported that at least 170 people were killed during air strikes amid the recent widely criticised elections. Credible sources cited more than 400 air strikes in total over the period. This violence highlights ongoing instability and human rights concerns in the country.</p>
<h2>United States: Federal Reserve Appointment and Legal Actions</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has selected economist Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve. Warsh, 55, was previously considered for the Fed chair position during Trump’s earlier term. His appointment could influence the direction of US monetary policy in the coming years.</p>
<p>In a separate development involving Trump, he and his sons have filed a lawsuit against the IRS and the US Treasury seeking $10 billion in damages. The suit follows the leak of tax information about Trump and his family to the media, marking a major legal confrontation over privacy and government transparency.</p>
<h2>Legal and Judicial News</h2>
<p>A judge ruled that Luigi Mangione, who faces murder charges, will not face the death penalty if convicted after dismissing two federal counts against him. However, he still faces state-level murder charges. The decision affects the legal proceedings and potential sentencing for Mangione going forward.</p>
<p>Additionally, former CNN host Don Lemon was arrested while covering anti-ICE protests at a church in Minnesota. Lemon stated he was performing his role as a journalist during the incident. This raises questions about journalists’ rights and safety when reporting on protests.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Issues</h2>
<p>In Indonesia’s Aceh province, a couple received 140 lashes each for offences related to sex and alcohol under Islamic law. Caning is a commonly used but controversial punishment in the region, sparking discussions about human rights and legal practices in Aceh.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These developments reflect a range of issues from diplomacy and conflict to finance and justice, underscoring ongoing tensions and challenges worldwide.</p>
