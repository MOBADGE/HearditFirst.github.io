    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 30, 2026</div>
    <h2>Ukraine Conflict Developments</h2>
<p>Ukraine's Air Force reported that areas near the frontline were targeted overnight by drones and a ballistic missile, highlighting ongoing tensions in the region. Meanwhile, Donald Trump commented that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not attack Ukrainian cities during the current cold week. This statement comes amid continued concerns about escalation, though attacks near the frontline continue to affect Ukraine's security situation.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Operation in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Tom Homan discussed the ongoing immigration operation in Minneapolis, indicating that federal agents might be withdrawn if local officials cooperate. He described the enforcement efforts as becoming more "targeted," aiming to reduce tensions in the city and address concerns raised in Congress. This reflects efforts by the administration to balance enforcement with political and community pressures.</p>
<h2>EU's Response to Iran</h2>
<p>The European Union added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its list of terrorist organizations. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas cited this move as a response to Iran's deadly crackdown on protesters, signaling increased pressure on Tehran from European governments. This designation could lead to new sanctions or diplomatic consequences as the EU seeks to respond to Iran's internal repression.</p>
<h2>US Budget Agreement</h2>
<p>Republican and Democratic lawmakers have reached a temporary funding agreement for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). According to US media reports, DHS funding will continue at the current level for two more weeks while both parties negotiate a longer-term deal. This short-term extension avoids an immediate funding lapse and provides additional time to resolve budget differences.</p>
<h2>Security Incident in Niger</h2>
<p>Suspected jihadist militants launched an attack near the airport close to Niger's capital. Niger's defense ministry confirmed that four military personnel were injured in the assault and that 20 attackers were killed during the response. This incident underscores ongoing security challenges in the region related to extremist groups.</p>
<h2>Venezuela's Oil Towns and US Investment Hopes</h2>
<p>Oil towns in Venezuela, marked by rusty pumps and inactive rigs, are looking to US investment to revive their fortunes. These once-wealthy communities have been economically depressed amid oil industry difficulties. The prospect of renewed investment linked to plans associated with Donald Trump has raised hopes that the sector and local economies might recover in the future.</p>
