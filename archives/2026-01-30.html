    <h2>US-Iran Tensions and Military Posture</h2>
<p>The US president has stated he would prefer to avoid military conflict with Iran but emphasized that Tehran must meet two conditions to prevent such action. Meanwhile, the US is increasing its military presence in the Gulf region. Alongside this, the European Union added Iran’s Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list, citing their role in suppressing protests in Iran. This move signals a hardening stance by European authorities in response to Iran's internal crackdown.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict and Security Developments</h2>
<p>In the ongoing conflict involving Ukraine, Ukrainian Air Force officials reported attacks near the front lines with drones and a ballistic missile. The US president asserted that Russian leader Vladimir Putin would not launch attacks on Ukrainian cities during an intense cold spell. This suggests some anticipation of tactical limitations amid worsening weather conditions that may influence military actions.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Politics: Immigration and Legal Actions</h2>
<p>The US immigration operation in Minneapolis may become more focused as federal agents could be withdrawn if local authorities cooperate, according to Tom Homan, an official overseeing border policies. This development aims to reduce tension both within the city and in federal legislative debates. Meanwhile, the US president and his sons have filed a lawsuit against the IRS and Treasury Department seeking $10 billion in damages, related to leaked tax information that appeared in the media.</p>
<h2>International Security: Attack in Niger</h2>
<p>Security concerns persist in West Africa after suspected jihadists attacked an airport near Niger’s capital. Reports from Niger’s defence ministry indicated that four military personnel were injured in the incident, while 20 attackers were killed. This event highlights ongoing instability and the challenges faced by regional forces combating militant groups.</p>
<h2>US Political Funding and UK-China Relations</h2>
<p>A bipartisan agreement has been reached to continue funding the US Department of Homeland Security at existing levels for two weeks, allowing more time for lawmakers to negotiate a longer-term funding deal. This short-term arrangement prevents immediate disruptions in homeland security operations. Separately, UK opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer’s recent visit to China resulted in agreements covering visas, services, healthcare, green technology, and finance, signifying efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation on various fronts.</p>
<h2>Cultural Recognition</h2>
<p>In cultural news, Nigerian music legend Fela Kuti will posthumously receive a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, marking the first time an African artist has been honored with this recognition nearly 30 years after his death. This award honors his lasting impact on music and global culture.</p>
