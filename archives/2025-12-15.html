    <h2>Australia’s Deadly Bondi Shooting</h2>
<p>A tragic mass shooting occurred at a Hanukkah festival in Bondi, Australia, marking the country’s deadliest such event in nearly 30 years. Among the victims were a 10-year-old girl, two rabbis, and a Holocaust survivor. Eyewitness videos capture how the celebration quickly turned to horror within minutes. Authorities continue to investigate the incident, which has deeply shaken the local community and raised concerns about security at public gatherings.</p>
<h2>Security Threats and Arrests in the US</h2>
<p>Officials in southern California have thwarted a New Year’s Eve terror plot. Four individuals face conspiracy charges after being caught planning to test explosives in the desert. The FBI’s intervention highlights ongoing vigilance against domestic threats ahead of major holidays, emphasizing the importance of intelligence and preventive actions to protect public safety.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Ukraine and Chile</h2>
<p>In Berlin, US representatives offered what they called “strong” security guarantees to Ukraine amid ongoing tensions. However, they provided few specifics on how Ukraine’s territorial disputes will be resolved. This development underlines the complex and unresolved nature of Ukraine’s sovereignty issues on the international stage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Chile, José Antonio Kast has been elected president. Kast is considered by many to be the most right-wing leader the country has had since Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship began in 1973. His presidency signals a significant political shift that may influence Chile’s future policies and international relations.</p>
<h2>High-Profile Legal and Human Rights Cases</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai was convicted in a national security trial. The 78-year-old UK citizen was found guilty of lobbying foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China, a case that has drawn widespread attention to China’s tightening control over the region.</p>
<p>Separately, Iranian Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi was reportedly taken to hospital following a violent arrest. Family members said she was beaten by plainclothes agents during the incident in Mashhad. Her treatment raises further concerns about human rights and political repression in Iran.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters Impacting Morocco</h2>
<p>Severe flash floods have hit Morocco, notably affecting Safi’s old city centre. At least 70 homes were flooded, causing significant damage and displacement. Authorities are monitoring the situation, which highlights the ongoing risks from extreme weather events in vulnerable regions.</p>
