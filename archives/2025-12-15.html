    <h2>Australia Mass Shooting at Bondi Hanukkah Festival</h2>
<p>A Hanukkah festival in Bondi, Australia, turned tragic when a gunman opened fire, resulting in the country’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years. Videos and eyewitness reports reveal how the joyful event quickly escalated into horror within minutes. Authorities have identified several of the victims, including two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor, and a 10-year-old girl. The incident has deeply affected the local community and raised urgent questions about public safety and security at gatherings.</p>
<h2>Gun Violence Incident in Rhode Island</h2>
<p>Following a shooting at Brown University in Rhode Island, authorities have named two of the victims who were killed, while nine others were injured. A search for the gunman remains underway. The attack has heightened concerns about gun violence in the United States, prompting law enforcement and community leaders to seek measures to prevent further tragedies.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Chile</h2>
<p>Chile has elected José Antonio Kast as its next president. Kast is described as a far-right figure, and many observers note that he may be the most right-wing leader since Augusto Pinochet, who led Chile through a 17-year dictatorship beginning in 1973. This political shift could have significant implications for the country’s future policies and social landscape.</p>
<h2>US-Ukraine Security Discussions</h2>
<p>In Berlin, US officials highlighted progress in offering Ukraine "strong" security guarantees amid ongoing conflict in the region. However, the talks did not clarify how Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty issues would be resolved. The lack of detail leaves questions about the next steps in diplomatic efforts to support Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity.</p>
<h2>Other News Highlights</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, tycoon Jimmy Lai, a 78-year-old UK citizen, was convicted in a high-profile national security trial. He was found guilty of lobbying foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China, underscoring continuing tensions between pro-democracy advocates and Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>In Iran, Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi was reportedly taken to hospital after a "violent arrest." Family members say she was beaten on the head and neck by plainclothes agents during her detention in Mashhad, raising concerns about human rights and the treatment of activists.</p>
<p>Morocco has suffered severe flash floods in the old city centre of Safi, resulting in dozens of homes being submerged. The floods have caused significant damage, and emergency responders are assessing the impact on affected communities.</p>
<p>Finally, in India, the conclusion of Lionel Messi’s tour was smooth despite a chaotic start in Kolkata, where fans damaged a stadium after missing any chance to see the football star. The incident highlighted the high public enthusiasm and challenges in managing large crowds during celebrity visits.</p>

<p>These stories show developments in public safety, international politics, and natural disasters affecting different parts of the world today.</p>
