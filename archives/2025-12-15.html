    <h2>International Tragedies: Bondi Beach and Brown University Shootings</h2>
<p>Two separate shooting incidents have drawn international attention this weekend. In Bondi Beach, Australia, authorities reported that among the victims were a 10-year-old girl, two rabbis, and a Holocaust survivor. This event marks the worst mass shooting in the country in almost 30 years. Verified footage has helped piece together how the incident unfolded. Meanwhile, at Brown University in Rhode Island, two people died and nine were injured in a shooting involving students. Officials initially detained a "person of interest," but they are set to be released. The identities of those affected at Brown University have not yet been made public.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments: Jimmy Lai Convicted in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>In a significant legal case, Jimmy Lai, a 78-year-old Hong Kong pro-democracy tycoon and UK citizen, was convicted on charges related to national security. He was found guilty of lobbying foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. This verdict comes amid ongoing concerns about political freedoms and the reach of national security laws in Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Politics: Chile Elects Far-Right President</h2>

This election outcome signals a notable shift in Chile's political landscape, and observers will be watching to see how Kast's policies impact the nation’s future.</p>
