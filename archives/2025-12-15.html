<h2>Hong Kong Trial and Conviction</h2>
<p>Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy prominent businessman in Hong Kong and UK citizen, has been convicted in a high-profile national security trial.

This development underscores ongoing concerns about the treatment of activists in Iran.</p>
<h2>Deadly Floods in Morocco</h2>
