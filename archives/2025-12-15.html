    <h2>Bondi Shooting Tragedy</h2>
<p>Australia is mourning one of its worst mass shootings in nearly 30 years after an attack at a Hanukkah festival in Bondi. Among those killed were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor, and a 10-year-old girl. Eyewitness videos and accounts show how the event quickly shifted from a festive celebration to horror within minutes. The incident has shocked the community and sparked a national conversation about safety and extremism.</p>
<h2>Security Threats and Law Enforcement Actions in the U.S.</h2>
<p>Authorities in southern California disrupted a New Year's Eve terror plot involving four individuals charged with conspiracy. The suspects were apprehended while planning to test explosives in the desert, preventing what officials describe as a serious security threat. This incident highlights ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement in countering domestic terrorism.</p>
<h2>International Politics: US and Ukraine</h2>
<p>U.S. officials announced "strong" security guarantees for Ukraine during talks in Berlin, signaling support amid ongoing conflict concerns. However, details remain unclear regarding how Ukraine's territorial sovereignty will be addressed. The developments suggest continued diplomatic efforts, though key questions about Ukraine's future borders remain unresolved.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Chile and Hong Kong</h2>
<p>In Chile, José Antonio Kast has been elected the next president. His victory is notable because many consider him the most right-wing leader since Augusto Pinochet’s 17-year dictatorship. This outcome could lead to significant changes in Chile’s political landscape.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, tycoon Jimmy Lai was convicted in a prominent national security trial. The 78-year-old UK citizen was found guilty of lobbying foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. This case reflects ongoing tensions around security laws and international relations in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>- Iranian Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi was hospitalized after what her family described as a violent arrest by plainclothes agents. She reported being beaten on the head and neck during the incident in Mashhad.
- Morocco faced severe flash floods that inundated at least 70 homes in the old city centre of Safi, causing casualties and significant damage.
- In India, footballer Lionel Messi’s tour ended smoothly despite earlier chaos in Kolkata, where fans damaged a stadium in frustration at not seeing him.</p>
