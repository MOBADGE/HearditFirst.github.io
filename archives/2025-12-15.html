    <h2>Australia Mass Shooting at Hanukkah Festival</h2>
<p>A tragic mass shooting took place at a Hanukkah festival in Bondi, Australia, resulting in several fatalities. Among the victims were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor, and a 10-year-old girl. Eyewitness accounts and videos show how the festive event turned to horror in just minutes. This incident marks Australia's deadliest mass shooting in nearly 30 years. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the motives and circumstances surrounding this attack.</p>
<h2>Security and Terrorism Updates in the US</h2>
<p>The FBI has disrupted a terror plot planned for New Year's Eve in southern California. Four people have been charged with conspiracy after attempting to test explosives in a desert area. This preemptive action highlights ongoing concerns about domestic security and the prevention of violent acts during major public events.</p>
<h2>US-Ukraine Security Discussions</h2>
<p>US officials have expressed that "strong" security guarantees have been offered to Ukraine amidst ongoing conflict talks in Berlin. However, they provided little detail on how Ukraine's territorial sovereignty issue will be resolved. These discussions are crucial for shaping future international support and security arrangements in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in Hong Kong and Iran</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai, a 78-year-old UK citizen, was convicted of lobbying foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. This high-profile national security trial draws attention to ongoing political tensions and legal measures in the region.</p>
<p>Separately, Iranian Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi was reportedly taken to hospital following a "violent arrest." Her family said she was beaten by plainclothes agents in the city of Mashhad. This incident raises concerns about human rights and treatment of activists in Iran.</p>
<h2>International News: Morocco Floods and Chilean Election</h2>
<p>Morocco is dealing with severe flash floods that have inundated parts of Safi's old city center, damaging at least 70 homes. The flooding has caused multiple deaths and significant property damage, emphasizing the challenges of extreme weather in vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>In Chile, far-right candidate José Antonio Kast has been elected as the next president. Many observers note he may be the most right-wing leader since Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile under a dictatorship from 1973. This election signals a potential shift in the country’s political landscape.</p>
