The label announced it has dropped member Danielle Marsh, while the status of fellow member Minji is still unclear. This breakup marks an abrupt end for a group that had gained significant attention, with the future activities of the remaining members uncertain.</p>
<h2>Environmental Efforts Halted on Mount Everest</h2>

The move highlights ongoing challenges in managing environmental impact and waste cleanup on one of the world's busiest and highest peaks.</p>
<h2>Tensions Rise Between Thailand and Cambodia</h2>
