    <h2>Entertainment: K-pop Group NewJeans Disbands After Record Label Dispute</h2>
<p>K-pop band NewJeans has broken up following a bitter conflict with their record label, Ador. The label announced it has dropped member Danielle Marsh, while the future of member Minji remains unclear. This marks an abrupt end to the band's activities, with no statement yet on any potential continuation or reformation of the group.</p>
<h2>Environment: Nepal Ends Mount Everest Waste Deposit Initiative</h2>
<p>Nepal has decided to scrap its Mount Everest waste deposit scheme, which required climbers to pay a $4,000 deposit refundable upon bringing down at least 8 kilograms of waste from the mountain. The scheme was deemed a failure, highlighting ongoing challenges in managing environmental impacts caused by tourism and mountaineering on Everest.</p>
<h2>International Relations: Tensions Rise in Southeast Asia and Middle East</h2>
<p>Thailand has accused Cambodia of violating a newly signed ceasefire agreement, which had come into effect just recently. The situation underlines continuing instability in the border region despite diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China conducted military drills around Taiwan, signaling a warning to "separatist forces." These exercises followed a major weapons sale from the US to Taiwan, reflecting persistent geopolitical tensions in the region.</p>
<p>In another development, the US claimed it had targeted a significant facility linked to alleged Venezuelan drug trafficking operations. According to remarks made by Donald Trump, the location involved dock areas used for loading drug boats, emphasizing ongoing concerns about drug trade routes.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Aid: US Commits $2 Billion Amid Calls for UN Reform</h2>
<p>The United States has pledged $2 billion in humanitarian aid, a move welcomed by the United Nations. However, this donation comes after previous reductions in US funding for humanitarian efforts, accompanied by a clear message from the US to the UN to "adapt or die." The pledge and accompanying commentary highlight ongoing debates about the efficiency and reform of international aid organizations.</p>
<h2>Politics: Kosovo Election Results and Israeli Recognition of Somaliland</h2>
<p>Kosovo's ruling party, Vetevendosje, secured a decisive election victory after months of political deadlock. This outcome grants a third term to party leader Albin Kurti, potentially affecting the region's political trajectory.</p>
<p>Separately, Israel's recent recognition of Somaliland as an independent state has stirred controversy. Somaliland seeks broader international recognition, and Israel’s decision adds a new dimension to diplomatic discussions about the region's status and political future.</p>
<h2>Refugees and Return: Syrians in Turkey Consider Returning Home</h2>
<p>Following the fall of Assad, Syrians living in Turkey are contemplating whether to return to their homeland. While some see an opportunity to go back, many recognize numerous challenges ahead, reflecting the complexities facing displaced populations in post-conflict scenarios.</p>
