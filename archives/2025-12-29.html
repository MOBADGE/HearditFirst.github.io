    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 29, 2025</div>
    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Tensions</h2>
<p>Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out a drone attack on a presidential residence. However, Ukrainian President Zelensky dismissed the accusation as "typical Russian lies." This exchange highlights ongoing hostilities and information disputes between the two countries. The situation remains tense, with little sign of de-escalation.</p>
<h2>K-pop Group NewJeans Disbands</h2>
<p>The popular K-pop band NewJeans has broken up following a bitter feud with their record label, Ador. The label has dropped member Danielle Marsh, while the return of another member, Minji, is currently uncertain. This development marks an abrupt end to the band's activities and raises questions about its members' future careers.</p>
<h2>US Drug Operation and Humanitarian Aid</h2>
<p>The US president announced a strike on what he described as a major facility linked to Venezuelan drug boats. He identified the target as a dock area used for loading boats with drugs. In a related development, the US pledged $2 billion for humanitarian aid, a move welcomed by the United Nations. However, this commitment comes after previous significant cuts to US funding for humanitarian operations, prompting calls for the UN to "adapt or die" in managing aid efforts.</p>
<h2>Environmental Efforts on Mount Everest End</h2>
<p>Nepal has decided to scrap a scheme aimed at reducing waste on Mount Everest. Under the failed program, climbers paid a $4,000 deposit that was refundable only if they brought down 8 kilograms of waste from the mountain. The decision to end the scheme points to ongoing challenges in managing environmental impacts in one of the world's most popular climbing destinations.</p>
<h2>Regional Conflicts and Military Drills</h2>
<p>Tensions persist in Southeast Asia, as Thailand accused Cambodia of breaking a newly signed ceasefire deal effective from midday Saturday local time. Meanwhile, China is conducting military drills around Taiwan, warning "separatist forces." These drills follow the recent announcement of a large US weapons sale to Taiwan, signaling continued friction in the region.</p>
<h2>Refugee Return Considerations and International Recognition</h2>
<p>Syrians living in Turkey are carefully considering whether it is the right moment to return home following the fall of President Assad, noting many challenges remain. In a separate diplomatic development, Israel has recognized Somaliland as an independent state. Somaliland seeks greater international recognition, and Israel’s move may influence geopolitical dynamics in the region.</p>
