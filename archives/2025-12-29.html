    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 29, 2025</div>
    <h2>Entertainment Industry</h2>
<p>The K-pop group NewJeans has disbanded following a serious dispute with their record label, Ador. As part of the fallout, Ador has removed member Danielle Marsh from the band while the status of another member, Minji, remains unclear. This breakup ends the band's activities, raising questions about the future of its former members.</p>
<h2>Environmental Issues</h2>
<p>Nepal will discontinue its Mount Everest waste deposit scheme, which was designed to encourage climbers to bring back trash from the mountain. Under the program, climbers paid a $4,000 deposit refundable upon returning at least 8kg of waste. Authorities have labeled the scheme as unsuccessful, signaling ongoing challenges for environmental management on the world's highest peak.</p>
<h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The US president announced a military strike against a Venezuelan facility alleged to be a hub for drug boat operations. He described the targeted location as a dock area used to load boats with drugs. This action underscores continued US efforts to combat drug trafficking in the region, although further details on the operation’s impact have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, Thailand has accused Cambodia of violating a newly established ceasefire agreement that took effect at midday local time on Saturday. The situation reflects persisting tensions between the neighboring countries despite recent efforts to reduce conflict.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China conducted military drills around Taiwan as a warning against separatist movements. These exercises shortly followed the announcement of a significant US arms sale to Taiwan, highlighting ongoing regional tensions surrounding Taiwan’s political status.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Aid and Political Developments</h2>
<p>The United States has pledged $2 billion to support humanitarian aid globally, a move welcomed by the United Nations. However, this commitment follows prior reductions in US funding and was accompanied by a call for the UN to "adapt or die," indicating expectations for reform within the organization.</p>
<p>In Kosovo, the ruling party Vetevendosje secured a decisive election victory, ending months of political deadlock. This win will grant the Albanian nationalist party’s leader, Albin Kurti, a third term, potentially ensuring continuity in governance amid ongoing challenges.</p>
<h2>Regional Recognition and Returnees</h2>
<p>Israel’s recent recognition of Somaliland as an independent state has sparked debate. Somaliland seeks broader international recognition, and Israel’s move may have strategic or political motivations, though the full implications remain uncertain.</p>
<p>In Turkey, many Syrians are considering whether to return to Syria following the fall of the Assad regime. Although some see this as a hopeful moment, numerous challenges remain for those contemplating resettlement, reflecting the complex and unsettled nature of the post-conflict environment.</p>
