    <h2>Ukraine Peace Talks Progress but Key Issues Remain</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky met in Florida to discuss peace talks aimed at resolving the conflict in Ukraine. Both leaders described the talks as positive, calling them "great" and "terrific." Despite this progress, the issue of territory remains unresolved, indicating significant challenges still lie ahead.

<h2>Mexico Train Derailment Causes Casualties</h2>

<h2>Heroic Act Thwarts Gunman in Australia</h2>
