    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 03, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Conflicts and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Russia's president is showing strong determination to continue the war in Ukraine despite mounting economic challenges. Recent talks indicate he remains committed to ongoing military efforts, which could mean further escalation in the conflict.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Israel has announced plans to open the Rafah crossing soon, allowing Palestinians to leave Gaza via Egypt. However, Egypt has denied coordinating with Israel on reopening the crossing and insists that any passage must allow movement in both directions. Meanwhile, Israel has received a coffin that Palestinian groups claim contains the body of a Gaza hostage, which will undergo forensic testing in Tel Aviv.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Federica Mogherini, a former European Union top diplomat, is under investigation for alleged favoritism in EU funding connected to a training programme at a school she leads. The inquiry focuses on whether there was any misuse of funds or preferential treatment in awarding the contract.</p>
<p>In the United States, President Donald Trump has announced plans to issue a "full and unconditional" pardon to a Democratic congressman from Texas and his wife, who were involved in a bribery case. Separately, Trump has expressed opposition to immigrants from Somalia amid plans by immigration authorities for a targeted operation in Minnesota, describing certain immigrants as "garbage" in his remarks.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Investigations</h2>
<p>Hong Kong authorities have ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh following a deadly fire at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex last week, which claimed at least 159 lives. Investigations into the cause and circumstances of the blaze are ongoing.</p>
<p>In Kenya, members of parliament have aired severe accusations against British soldiers, alleging decades of sexual abuse, including rape and other forms of violence, as well as environmental destruction. These allegations follow a two-year investigation highlighting serious abuses.</p>
<p>In France, three teenagers tragically drowned after their car ended up upside down in a swimming pool. The local prosecutor described the incident as stemming from an "unbelievable series of circumstances," suggesting it was a rare and complex accident.</p>
<h2>Human Interest</h2>
<p>An unusual incident in the United States involved a raccoon that broke into a liquor store, became intoxicated, and passed out on the floor. The animal was unharmed during the episode and was safely released back into the wild after sobering up, providing a rare light-hearted moment amid darker news stories.</p>
