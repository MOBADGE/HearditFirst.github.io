    <h2>Middle East Border Crossing Developments</h2>
<p>Israel has announced plans to open the Rafah crossing soon to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza via Egypt. This move could ease some pressure on the Gaza Strip, where movement is heavily restricted. However, Egypt has denied coordinating with Israel on the reopening and emphasized that passage should be possible in both directions. The situation remains sensitive as both countries navigate the complex humanitarian and security concerns linked to the crossing.</p>
<h2>International Investigation into EU Funding</h2>
<p>A fraud investigation has been launched targeting Federica Mogherini, the former top diplomat of the European Union. The inquiry focuses on allegations of favouritism connected to EU funds granted for a training programme at a school Mingherini heads. The probe could have implications for accountability and transparency within EU funding programmes, depending on the findings.</p>
<h2>U.S. Immigration and Minnesota ICE Operation</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Somali immigrants in the United States amid plans by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a new operation in Minnesota. Trump stated that allowing more immigration is going the "wrong way" for the country, using harsh language to describe immigrants. This reflects ongoing tensions around immigration policy, particularly concerning vulnerable communities.</p>
<h2>Renewed Search for Missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370</h2>
<p>Authorities are set to resume the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared in 2014 with 239 people aboard. The Boeing 777’s disappearance remains one of the most enduring aviation mysteries. Restarting the search efforts may bring new insights or closure to families affected by the tragedy.</p>
<h2>Allegations of Abuse by British Soldiers in Kenya</h2>
<p>Kenyan members of parliament have presented a report detailing decades of alleged abuse by British soldiers. The two-year investigation uncovers disturbing claims including rape, sexual violence, murders, and environmental destruction. These accusations raise serious questions about past military conduct and accountability.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>- In France, three teenagers drowned after their car crashed upside down in a swimming pool. Local prosecutors described the accident as the result of an "unbelievable series of circumstances."</p>
<p>- A Chinese factory producing sex dolls with a childlike appearance has halted production amid increased scrutiny. This follows a global ban announced by the retailer Shein on such products.</p>
<p>- India has rescinded an order requiring smartphones to come pre-installed with a state-run cyber safety app. The original mandate faced strong opposition from cyber experts concerned about privacy and security.</p>
