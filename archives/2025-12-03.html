    <h2>Immigration Policy and Social Issues in the US</h2>
<p>The president has expressed opposition to allowing more Somali immigrants into the United States, stating that the country will "go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country." This statement comes amid plans for a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation targeting the Somali community in Minnesota. The president’s remarks highlight ongoing tensions over immigration policies and enforcement practices in the US.</p>
<h2>Political Debate in Israel</h2>
<p>In Israel, lawmakers are debating a draft bill that aims to end the military exemption currently granted to ultra-Orthodox Jewish men engaged in full-time religious studies. This exemption has long been a contentious issue, with critics arguing that it creates unequal service obligations. The outcome of this debate could significantly affect social cohesion and military service policies within the country.</p>
<h2>Investigation Involving Former EU Diplomat</h2>
<p>Federica Mogherini, the former top diplomat of the European Union, is under investigation for alleged favoritism in awarding EU funding. The inquiry focuses on a training programme at a school where Mogherini holds a leadership position. This development sheds light on concerns related to transparency and accountability in the allocation of EU resources.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns Raised by Kenyan MPs</h2>
<p>A two-year investigation by Kenyan lawmakers has brought forward serious allegations against British soldiers stationed in Kenya. The report includes disturbing accusations of rape, sexual violence, murders, and environmental damage. These claims have put pressure on both the British and Kenyan authorities to address these issues and reinforce protections for local communities.</p>
<h2>Resumption of Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370</h2>
<p>Efforts to locate the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are set to resume. The Boeing 777 vanished in 2014 with 239 people onboard, marking one of the most mysterious cases in aviation history. Renewed search operations signal ongoing commitment to solving the mystery and providing closure for the families affected.</p>
<h2>Technology and Consumer Protection in India</h2>
<p>India has withdrawn a controversial order requiring smartphones to have a state-run cyber safety app pre-installed and registered by users. The mandate faced strong opposition from cyber experts who criticized it on privacy and security grounds. The reversal may influence future government approaches to digital safety and regulation.</p>
<h2>Additional Notable Stories</h2>
<p>- A man has been charged after allegedly swallowing a $19,000 Fabergé egg pendant set with diamonds and sapphires. Authorities have not yet recovered the precious item.
- Italian fashion company Prada has acquired Versace in a deal valued at $1.38 billion, well below the $2 billion price paid for Versace in 2018, indicating shifts in the luxury fashion market.
- YouTube has stated that upcoming social media regulations in Australia will make its platform less safe for children, due to the removal of parental controls designed to protect young users.
- In a lighter story, a raccoon was found intoxicated and passed out inside a liquor store after breaking in. The animal was unharmed and released back into the wild after recovering.</p>
<p>These developments highlight ongoing concerns and changes across politics, international relations, human rights, technology, and culture worldwide.</p>
