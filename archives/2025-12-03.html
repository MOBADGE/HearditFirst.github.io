    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 03, 2025</div>
    <h2>US Immigration and Enforcement</h2>
<p>The US president expressed strong opposition to allowing more Somalis to enter the country, describing them in negative terms. This statement comes amid plans by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to carry out operations in Minnesota, where there is a significant Somali community. The administration’s stance signals a continued focus on stricter immigration controls.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Israel and Honduras</h2>
<p>In Israel, a controversy is emerging over a proposed bill to end military service exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jewish men who study religious texts full-time. Lawmakers are debating this draft legislation which could alter longstanding arrangements and provoke societal debate about military service obligations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Honduras, the presidential election remains too close to call. Former vice-president Salvador Nasralla currently has a slight lead over Nasry Asfura, a conservative former mayor of the capital, Tegucigalpa. The results will shape Honduras’ political future, though it is unclear whether former US political figure Donald Trump’s preferences regarding the election outcome will be realized.</p>
<h2>Aviation Mystery: MH370 Search to Resume</h2>
<p>Efforts to find Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are set to restart. The Boeing 777 disappeared in 2014 with 239 people onboard, creating one of the most enduring mysteries in aviation history. Renewed search activities could provide answers to what happened to the plane and possibly offer closure to families affected.</p>
<h2>Digital Policy Changes in India</h2>
<p>The Indian government has withdrawn an order requiring all smartphones sold in the country to come pre-installed with a state-run cyber safety app. This reversal follows significant criticism from cybersecurity experts who raised concerns about privacy and security implications. The move highlights ongoing tensions between government policy initiatives and digital rights advocates.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Social Challenges in Asia</h2>
<p>Delhi is facing a severe health crisis due to toxic air pollution, with about 200,000 cases of acute respiratory illness recorded recently. Over the past two years, this pollution has led to tens of thousands of hospital admissions, spotlighting the city’s environmental and public health challenges.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, recent cyclone-induced flooding has spurred a strong community response. Local fishing boats are aiding relief efforts by delivering supplies to affected areas, and volunteer-run kitchens are providing food. This grassroots effort underlines the resilience and solidarity in the face of natural disasters.</p>
<h2>Business and Consumer Technology News</h2>
<p>In the fashion industry, Prada has acquired Versace in a deal valued at $1.38 billion, significantly less than the price Versace commanded in an earlier 2018 sale. This acquisition reshapes the landscape of Italian luxury brands.</p>
<p>In Australia, a new social media ban has led YouTube to warn that its platform will be less safe for children. Due to restrictions, parental control features will be reduced, potentially affecting how children use the platform and raising concerns about online safety.</p>
<h2>Unusual Crime Report</h2>
<p>A man has been charged with theft linked to a rare Fabergé egg pendant, worth thousands of dollars and adorned with diamonds and sapphires. Authorities have not recovered the item, and reports indicate the suspect may have swallowed it. The case remains under investigation.</p>
