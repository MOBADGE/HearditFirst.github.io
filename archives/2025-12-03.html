    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>Immigration and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>The US president has publicly opposed the presence of Somali immigrants in the country, warning that accepting what he called "garbage" would be detrimental to the nation. This statement comes as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) prepares for an operation in Minnesota, a state with a relatively large Somali community. The development highlights ongoing debates around immigration policies and enforcement actions.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Israel</h2>
<p>Israeli lawmakers are debating a controversial draft bill that would end the longstanding exemption from military conscription for ultra-Orthodox men engaged in full-time religious study. This issue has been a point of tension in Israeli society, reflecting debates about equality in national service and the integration of religious communities into broader civic responsibilities. The outcome of the bill could have significant social and political implications.</p>
<h2>International Investigations and Accusations</h2>
<p>In Europe, a fraud investigation has been launched involving Federica Mogherini, the head of a school, who is also a former top European Union diplomat. The inquiry centers on allegations of favoritism related to EU funding provided for a training programme at the institution she leads. This matter raises questions about transparency and accountability in the use of EU funds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kenyan members of parliament have accused British soldiers of multiple serious offenses, including sexual abuse, murder, and environmental destruction. A two-year investigation has uncovered disturbing accounts detailing these acts, highlighting ongoing concerns about the conduct of foreign military personnel and their impact on local communities.</p>
<h2>Aviation Mystery Search Resumes</h2>
<p>Efforts to locate the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared in 2014 with 239 people on board, are set to resume. This flight's disappearance remains one of the most puzzling aviation mysteries in recent history. Renewed search operations may provide answers for the families affected and the broader aviation community interested in the case.</p>
<h2>Technology Policy Change in India</h2>
<p>India has reversed a recent directive that would have required smartphones to come pre-installed with a government-run cyber safety app. The original order met significant opposition from cybersecurity experts who raised concerns about privacy and security. This policy reversal suggests a reconsideration of how best to balance digital safety with individual rights.</p>
