    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Diplomatic Efforts</h2>
<p>Talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine recently took place in Moscow but did not lead to significant progress. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, to stop wasting time, signaling frustration over the stalled negotiations. At the same time, analysts note that Putin appears determined to continue the conflict despite mounting economic challenges facing Russia. The ongoing war and failed diplomacy highlight the continued instability in the region, with no clear resolution in sight.</p>
<h2>Developments in Gaza and Israel</h2>
<p>Israel announced plans to reopen the Rafah crossing to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza through Egypt. However, Egypt denied coordinating with Israel on this move and emphasized that any passage at the crossing should be open in both directions. Meanwhile, Israel received a coffin containing what Palestinian groups say is the body of a hostage from Gaza. The remains will be brought to Tel Aviv for forensic examination. These developments come as tensions and humanitarian concerns in the region remain high.</p>
<h2>Investigations and Controversies in Europe</h2>
<p>An investigation has been launched into former EU diplomat Federica Mogherini over allegations of favoritism related to EU funding for a training program at a school where she held a leadership role. The inquiry focuses on possible misconduct in the allocation of funds, underscoring ongoing scrutiny of public officials and transparency within the European Union’s institutions.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Tragedies</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, authorities ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh following a deadly fire at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex last week. The blaze resulted in at least 159 deaths, and investigations into its cause continue. Elsewhere in France, three teenagers drowned after a car crashed upside down into a swimming pool. Local prosecutors described the crash as the result of an “unbelievable series of circumstances,” emphasizing the tragic nature of the accident.</p>
<h2>Other News Highlights</h2>
<p>In the United States, the president expressed opposition to Somalis entering the country amid plans by immigration enforcement officials for an operation in Minnesota. He described continued immigration from certain groups as "taking in garbage," reflecting ongoing debate over immigration policy. On a lighter note, a raccoon was found passed out on the floor of a liquor store after breaking in and consuming alcohol. The animal was unharmed and released back into the wild after sobering up.</p>
