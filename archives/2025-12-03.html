    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 03, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Russia's president appears resolute in continuing the war in Ukraine, despite mounting economic challenges facing the country. His determination suggests the conflict may persist, potentially prolonging instability in the region.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Israel announced plans to open the Rafah crossing to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza via Egypt. However, Egypt denied coordinating with Israel on the reopening and emphasized that passage should be open in both directions. Meanwhile, Israel received a coffin that Palestinian groups claim contains the body of a hostage found in northern Gaza. The remains will undergo forensic testing in Tel Aviv to clarify the circumstances.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in Europe and the US</h2>
<p>Federica Mogherini, the former top diplomat for the European Union, is under investigation for alleged favoritism involving EU funds directed to a training program at a school she leads. The inquiry focuses on whether funding decisions were improperly influenced.</p>
<p>In the United States, the president stated opposition to Somali immigration amid plans for a Minnesota immigration enforcement operation by ICE. He expressed concern about allowing what he called "garbage" into the country, signaling a hardline stance on immigration. Additionally, the same president announced plans to grant a "full and unconditional" pardon to a Texas Democratic congressman and his wife, who face bribery charges.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Social Issues</h2>
<p>Kenyan members of parliament have accused British soldiers of sexual abuse, including rape, violence, and murder, as well as environmental destruction, spanning several decades. This followed a two-year investigation detailing the allegations, raising questions about historical accountability.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accidents and Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>In France, three teenagers drowned after their car crashed upside down into a swimming pool. Authorities described the event as resulting from an "unbelievable series of circumstances," highlighting the tragic and unusual nature of the accident.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, authorities ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh from buildings after a deadly fire at Wang Fuk Court housing complex killed at least 159 people last week. Investigations continue as officials assess safety measures and fire prevention protocols to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<h2>Lighthearted Incident</h2>
<p>In a lighter story, a raccoon was found intoxicated and passed out on the floor of a liquor store after breaking in. Animal protection officers ensured the animal suffered no injuries and released it back into the wild once it recovered.</p>
