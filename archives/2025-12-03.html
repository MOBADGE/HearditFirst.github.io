    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 03, 2025</div>
    <h2>U.S. Immigration and Minnesota ICE Operation</h2>
<p>The U.S. president expressed opposition to Somalis entering the country, stating the nation would "go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country." This comes as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans an operation in Minnesota. The operation and the president’s remarks highlight ongoing tensions around immigration policies and enforcement in the U.S., especially concerning refugee and immigrant communities.</p>
<h2>Israeli Conscription Debate</h2>
<p>A political crisis is emerging in Israel over a proposed law that would end the exemption from military conscription for ultra-Orthodox men who study full-time religious texts. Lawmakers are considering this draft bill, which could significantly impact the ultra-Orthodox community and the broader Israeli society. The debate reflects long-standing tensions about military service obligations and social integration.</p>
<h2>Honduran Election Drama</h2>
<p>In Honduras, the presidential election remains tightly contested with former vice-president Salvador Nasralla holding a small lead over Nasry Asfura, a conservative and former mayor of Tegucigalpa. The close race raises questions about political dynamics in the country and whether external influences, including the U.S. president’s preferences, might affect the outcome.</p>
<h2>Resumption of MH370 Search</h2>
<p>Efforts to locate Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared in 2014 with 239 people onboard, are set to resume. The disappearance remains one of the most baffling aviation mysteries. Restarting the search could provide answers to families still hoping for closure and advance understanding of aviation safety.</p>
<h2>Significant Fashion Industry Deal</h2>
<p>Italian fashion company Prada has acquired Versace for $1.38 billion (£1.04 billion), a price notably lower than Versace’s $2 billion sale in 2018. This deal brings together two major Italian luxury brands, potentially reshaping the fashion landscape and signaling shifts in the industry's business strategies.</p>
<h2>Australian Social Media Ban Effects</h2>
<p>YouTube has warned that Australia’s new social media ban will make its platform less safe for children. The Google-owned service stated that parental controls will be removed as a result of the ban. This development raises concerns about online safety and the impact of regulatory measures on digital platforms for young users.</p>
