    <h2>U.S. Immigration and Enforcement Plans</h2>
<p>The U.S. president has expressed opposition to accepting more immigrants from Somalia, stating that continuing to take in what he called "garbage" would be detrimental to the country. This statement comes as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans an operation in Minnesota. The comments highlight ongoing debates over immigration policy and enforcement actions, with potential impacts on communities with Somali residents in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Political Tensions in Israel</h2>
<p>Israeli lawmakers are considering a contentious draft bill that would end the exemption from military service currently granted to ultra-Orthodox men enrolled in full-time religious studies. The move has sparked a crisis in the country’s political landscape, as the ultra-Orthodox community strongly opposes conscription. The outcome of this bill could significantly affect Israeli society and politics, influencing military recruitment and religious-community relations.</p>
<h2>Close Election in Honduras</h2>
<p>Honduras is in the midst of a tight presidential election race. Former vice-president Salvador Nasralla holds a slight lead over Nasry Asfura, the conservative former mayor of Tegucigalpa. The narrow margin suggests a closely contested result, raising questions about what the election outcome means for the country’s future policies and international relations. The article also hints at uncertainty about whether the U.S. president’s preferences will be influential in this context.</p>
<h2>Resuming Search for MH370</h2>
<p>Authorities plan to restart the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared in 2014 with 239 people on board. This airplane vanishing is considered one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history. Renewed efforts to locate the aircraft reflect ongoing interest and hope for closure for the families of those lost, and may involve advances in technology or new information guiding investigators.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Child Safety in Australia</h2>
<p>YouTube has warned that Australia's new social media ban could reduce safety features for children using its platform. The Google-owned service says parental controls will be removed as a consequence of the ban, potentially making the platform less safe for younger users. This development points to challenges in balancing regulatory measures with online safety, and raises concerns among parents and regulators about protecting children on digital platforms.</p>
<h2>Crisis and Community Response in Sri Lanka</h2>
<p>Sri Lanka is coping with severe flooding caused by a cyclone. In response, local volunteers and communities have mobilized to provide relief, including delivering supplies by fishing boats and supplying food through community kitchens. This grassroots effort highlights the resilience and solidarity of affected populations amid natural disasters, as well as the ongoing need for coordinated aid to manage humanitarian impacts.</p>
