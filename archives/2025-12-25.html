    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 25, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Peace and Conflict</h2>
<p>Pope Leo delivered his first Christmas address from the Vatican, urging "courage" to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. In his message to worshippers, he also expressed concern for the situation faced by Palestinians. The pope called for peace and resolution in conflicts around the world, emphasizing the need for dialogue and compassion during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Nigeria, a bomb blast in a packed mosque in Maiduguri during evening prayers resulted in five deaths and injured 35 others. Police are investigating the incident, which has added to concerns about safety and security in the region.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in South Asia and Latin America</h2>
<p>Tarique Rahman, a leading figure and front-runner to become Bangladesh's prime minister, returned to the country after 17 years in exile in London. His arrival comes ahead of upcoming pivotal elections, signaling a significant moment for Bangladesh’s political future.</p>
<p>In Honduras, a closely contested election resulted in victory for a candidate supported by Donald Trump. Although his opponent, Salvador Nasralla, has refused to accept the results, he urged his supporters to remain calm, hinting at possible political tensions as the situation unfolds.</p>
<h2>Security Actions in Turkey</h2>
<p>Turkish authorities detained 115 individuals suspected of planning attacks on New Year's celebrations. Firearms were seized during the operations, and officials are continuing efforts to track down other possible suspects. This move underscores ongoing security concerns in Turkey amid heightened vigilance during holiday periods.</p>
<h2>Notable Events in the United States and Brazil</h2>
<p>In the United States, Representative Joyce Beatty, who serves on the board of the Kennedy Center, filed a lawsuit to reverse the renaming of the center to include Donald Trump’s name. Beatty argues that legally such a change requires approval from Congress, making the current renaming invalid.</p>
<p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro underwent successful hernia surgery. Bolsonaro is currently serving a 27-year prison sentence related to allegations of plotting a coup following the 2022 presidential election, a significant detail reflecting ongoing political turmoil in Brazil.</p>
<h2>Christmas Celebrations Worldwide</h2>
<p>Festive activities and religious services took place across the globe to mark Christmas. From waterskiing Santas to traditional meals, communities from London to Bethlehem celebrated the holiday in diverse and vibrant ways. In the United States, Donald Trump participated in NORAD’s 70th annual Santa Tracker event, answering children’s calls about Santa’s whereabouts, adding a lighthearted touch to the holiday season.</p>
