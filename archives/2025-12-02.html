    <div class="date">December 02, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Steve Witkoff, an envoy connected to former US President Donald Trump, is scheduled to hold important talks at the Kremlin in Moscow. These discussions focus on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The White House has expressed optimism about the potential for a breakthrough in peace efforts. These talks come at a critical time as both sides seek to find common ground, though details on what might be agreed upon remain unclear.</p>
<h2>US Military Actions and Legal Questions</h2>
<p>The US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorised two deadly strikes on boats linked to Venezuela, with a US Navy admiral ordered to carry out the second attack. These operations have sparked questions about their legality under international and domestic laws. However, the White House insists that all necessary legal protocols were observed. This situation raises concerns about the use of military force in the region and its diplomatic implications.</p>
<h2>Technology and Cybersecurity in India</h2>
<p>India has ordered all smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a new state-owned cybersecurity app on all new devices sold in the country. This move reflects India's increasing focus on digital security and government oversight of technology platforms. The requirement aims to protect users and the national digital infrastructure, though it may also raise debates about privacy and government control in the tech industry.</p>
<h2>Lebanon and Tragedy Reflections</h2>
<p>Pope Leo XIV concluded his three-day visit to Lebanon by praying at the site of the Beirut port explosion, which killed more than 200 people. During his visit, the Pope called for justice for the victims of this devastating disaster. His visit highlights ongoing concerns about accountability and reconstruction efforts in Lebanon following the tragic event.</p>
<h2>Protests and Political Response in Bulgaria</h2>
<p>Tens of thousands of protesters in Bulgaria forced the government to abandon its first-ever budget plan presented in euros. The demonstrators accused the plan of masking widespread government corruption. The large turnout and government’s withdrawal of the budget underscore ongoing political tensions and public dissatisfaction with governance in Bulgaria.</p>
<h2>Public Safety in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, the leader has ordered an investigation into a massive fire that killed 151 people, marking the deadliest fire in the city's history in over 70 years. This tragedy has prompted a swift government response to determine causes and prevent future incidents, highlighting concerns about public safety standards in the densely populated city.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>- In Italy, a statue of the opera singer Pavarotti placed in an ice rink and frozen knee-deep in ice has drawn criticism. Pavarotti’s widow called the installation an "absurd decision," especially as skaters were encouraged to interact physically by high-fiving the statue.</p>
<p>- Nigeria is sheltering Guinea-Bissau’s presidential candidate Fernando Dias in its embassy amid fears for his life following a coup.</p>
<p>- Costco has filed a lawsuit seeking a full refund of tariffs imposed during Donald Trump’s administration after lower courts ruled against those tariff measures.</p>
