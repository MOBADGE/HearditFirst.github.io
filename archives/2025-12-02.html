<h2>U.S. Military Action in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense, under Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, authorized a second deadly strike on boats in Venezuela. This action has sparked questions about its legality, though the White House maintains that all applicable laws were followed. The strikes highlight ongoing security concerns in the region and could affect U.S.-Venezuela relations moving forward.</p>
<h2>Indian Cybersecurity Policy</h2>
<p>India has mandated that all smartphone manufacturers pre-install a state-run cybersecurity application on new devices. This move aims to enhance digital safety for users across the country. The requirement signals India's focus on strengthening cyber defenses amid rising concerns over online threats and data privacy.</p>
<h2>Honduras Election Results Close</h2>
