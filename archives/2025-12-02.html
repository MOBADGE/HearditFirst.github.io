    <h2>Ukraine Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Steve Witkoff, a special envoy linked to former US President Donald Trump, is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The White House has expressed optimism about the possibility of a breakthrough in these talks. The conflict continues to deeply affect people in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where opinions vary widely. Some Ukrainians feel they have sacrificed too much to lose territory to Russia, while others are eager for any peace deal that might end the war, despite the costs.</p>
<h2>US Military Actions and Legal Questions</h2>
<p>The US has carried out two deadly boat strikes against Venezuela, authorised by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. These actions have sparked questions about their legality. However, the White House has stated that all relevant laws have been followed. This military activity is part of a broader context that includes the deployment of US forces near Venezuela, raising tensions with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<h2>Cybersecurity Measures in India</h2>
<p>India has directed smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a new state-run cyber safety app on all new devices sold in the country. This measure aims to enhance cybersecurity for users, reflecting the government's increasing focus on digital safety amid growing concerns about cyber threats.</p>
<h2>Lebanon Visit and Call for Justice</h2>
<p>Pope Leo XIV concluded a three-day visit to Lebanon by praying at the site of the devastating Beirut port explosion. He called for justice for the more than 200 people who died in the disaster, highlighting ongoing demands for accountability and support for the victims' families in Lebanon.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns in Europe</h2>
<p>In Germany, thousands of rounds of army ammunition were stolen from a truck after the driver left the vehicle unattended in an unguarded parking lot overnight. This incident raises concerns about military security and the potential risks associated with the loss of such materials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, the government withdrew its first euro-denominated budget plan following large protests. Tens of thousands of demonstrators accused the plan of attempting to conceal widespread corruption within the government, signaling continued public dissatisfaction with political governance.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Safety Issues</h2>
<p>Nigeria has granted asylum to Fernando Dias, a presidential candidate from Guinea-Bissau, who is currently sheltering in Nigeria’s embassy there. This move comes amid fears for his safety following a recent coup.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the city’s leader has ordered an investigation into a deadly fire that killed 151 people, marking it the deadliest fire in more than 70 years. Authorities are seeking to understand the causes of the tragedy to prevent future incidents.</p>
