    <h2>Ukraine-Russia Talks Progress</h2>
<p>Talks held at the Kremlin between Russian President Vladimir Putin and a delegation linked to Donald Trump lasted five hours and were described by Kremlin officials as "constructive." However, they also indicated that "a lot of work lies ahead," signaling that the conflict in Ukraine remains unresolved. In Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, opinions among residents are divided. Some feel the country has sacrificed too much to give up territory, while others express a strong desire for peace to end the ongoing war.</p>
<h2>US Military and Venezuela</h2>
<p>The White House confirmed that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized two deadly strikes on vessels near Venezuela. These actions raise questions about their legality, but US officials maintain that all laws have been followed. Additional reporting highlights a recent deployment of a large US military force near Venezuela, linked to the region’s ongoing tensions and political disputes involving the Venezuelan government under Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<h2>Security and Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>India has directed all smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a government-developed cybersecurity app on all new devices sold in the country. This move reflects growing concerns about digital security among Indian authorities. Meanwhile, in Germany, thousands of rounds of military ammunition were stolen after a truck driver left the vehicle in an unguarded parking lot overnight, raising concerns about weapons security and potential criminal use.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Amid political instability in Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria granted asylum to Fernando Dias, a presidential candidate facing an imminent threat to his life after a coup. Nigeria is currently sheltering him in its embassy in the capital, Bissau. Additionally, the Pope concluded a three-day visit to Lebanon by praying at the site of the devastating Beirut port blast. He called for justice for the more than 200 victims of the disaster.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, local authorities launched an investigation into a deadly fire that killed 151 people, the city’s deadliest in over 70 years. In London, a rare and highly valuable Fabergé egg, commissioned in 1913, sold for a record £22.9 million at auction. The Imperial Winter Egg is adorned with 4,500 diamonds and remains an important piece of Russian history.</p>
