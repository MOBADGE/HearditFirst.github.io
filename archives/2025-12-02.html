    <h2>Ukraine Peace Talks in Moscow</h2>
<p>Steve Witkoff, a representative connected to Donald Trump, is scheduled to meet with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin to discuss the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The White House has expressed optimism about a potential breakthrough from these talks. This diplomatic engagement marks a key moment, as both sides seek progress toward resolving the war, which has significant impacts on regional stability and international relations.</p>
<h2>US Navy Strike Controversy in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The White House confirmed that a US Navy admiral ordered a second deadly strike on a boat in Venezuelan waters. While the strike has sparked debate over its legality, officials maintain that the naval commander acted within his authority and in accordance with the law. This incident raises important questions about US military operations abroad and the balance of executive power in such decisions.</p>
<h2>Smartphone Safety Rules in India</h2>
<p>India has announced new regulations requiring all smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a government-owned cybersecurity application on new devices sold in the country. This move reflects the government's growing focus on digital security and data protection for its large population of mobile users. It may also influence how tech companies design and distribute devices in India going forward.</p>
<h2>Tight Presidential Race in Honduras</h2>
<p>Honduras' electoral authority reported a narrow margin between the two leading presidential candidates, creating what officials call a "technical tie." Right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura leads former TV host Salvador Nasralla by just 515 votes. The close race highlights political divisions in the country and sets the stage for a tense post-election period as final results are confirmed.</p>
<h2>Deadly Fire in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Hong Kong's leader has ordered an official investigation into a fire that has claimed 151 lives, making it the deadliest fire in the city in over 70 years. The high death toll underscores concerns about safety standards and emergency response. The investigation will aim to identify causes and prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p>
<h2>Natural Disaster Toll Rises in Indonesia</h2>
<p>Flooding and a cyclone in Indonesia have led to more than 600 deaths, with an additional 500 people reported missing and thousands injured. The scale of the disaster poses serious challenges for rescue and recovery operations, while raising urgency for enhanced disaster preparedness and climate resilience in the region.</p>
