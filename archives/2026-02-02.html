    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>Legal Developments in Norway</h2>
<p>Marius Borg Høiby, son of Norway's Crown Princess, has been remanded in custody for four weeks following new allegations of assault. He is due to go on trial for a rape charge starting Tuesday. These developments add serious legal challenges ahead of his trial and will likely affect the proceedings.</p>
<h2>Middle East Border Update</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. However, only a limited number of Palestinians—dozens daily—will be allowed to cross in either direction, and no goods will be transported. This partial reopening offers some movement for people in Gaza but keeps the flow of goods restricted, continuing to impact the region's humanitarian situation.</p>
<h2>Technology and Security in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Elon Musk has restricted the use of Starlink-enabled drones by Russian forces, following reports that these drones were involved in deadly attacks against Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have welcomed the move, describing it as producing "real results" in curtailing Russia’s military capabilities. This represents an example of how technology companies are influencing the dynamics of modern conflict.</p>
<h2>International Relations: US and India Trade Agreement</h2>
<p>The United States and India have reached a bilateral trade agreement. Under the deal, tariffs on Indian goods entering the US will be reduced from 50% to 18%. Additionally, India has committed to cease purchasing Russian oil. This agreement could reshape trade flows between the two countries and aligns India more closely with US policies on energy imports.</p>
<h2>Human Interest: Heroic Rescue and Tragic Ski Accident</h2>
<p>In Australia, a 13-year-old boy made headlines after swimming 4 kilometers through rough seas to save his mother and siblings, who had been swept off the coast of Western Australia. Meanwhile, in Japan, a 22-year-old Australian woman died after getting caught in a ski lift chair, which left her suspended before she suffered a fatal heart attack. Both stories highlight extraordinary experiences involving ordinary people in dangerous situations.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Citizenship Updates</h2>
<p>Beijing has criticized the Dalai Lama’s recent Grammy award win, calling it “manipulation”. The spiritual leader was recognized in the audiobook category for his meditations. Separately, Ghana has suspended its citizenship application process for people of African descent, a program that began in 2016 allowing those who can prove African ancestry to obtain Ghanaian nationality. These developments touch on issues of cultural recognition and citizenship rights.</p>
