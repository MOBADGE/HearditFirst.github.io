    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>Royal Controversy in Norway</h2>
<p>Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has said he agrees with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's admission that she showed "poor judgement" regarding her connections to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The princess had faced criticism over her past contacts with Epstein, and Støre’s remarks indicate official acknowledgment of the misstep. The situation highlights ongoing sensitivity around Epstein’s network and the scrutiny of public figures linked to him.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Humanitarian Update from Gaza and Ukraine</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a key point for movement in and out of Gaza. However, the crossing will allow only a limited number of Palestinians—dozens per day—and no goods to cross, restricting trade and movement of supplies. This partial reopening could be a temporary measure amid tense conditions in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Ukraine, a Russian strike near a bus carrying miners has reportedly killed twelve individuals and injured fifteen more. The attack underlines the continued violence and civilian casualties affecting the country.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security in Costa Rica and Nigeria</h2>
<p>Laura Fernández has won Costa Rica’s presidential election decisively in the first round, campaigning on a tough-on-crime platform. Her victory comes amid growing public concern about organised crime in the country, suggesting that security issues are a top priority for voters.</p>
<p>In northern Nigeria, eighty people who were kidnapped from three churches in Kaduna state last month have now returned home after escaping. A total of 177 people were originally seized, highlighting ongoing security challenges in the region involving kidnappings.</p>
<h2>Media Challenges and Legal Threats</h2>
<p>Steve Rosenberg, the BBC’s Russia editor, has shared his experiences of the difficulties faced by foreign journalists in Moscow. He describes a challenging environment of suspicion, including being insulted and questioned about his work. This reflects broader tensions between Russian authorities and Western media.</p>
<p>In the United States, the current president has threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah over a joke Noah made about Epstein during the Grammys ceremony. The president described Noah as a "total loser," signaling an ongoing clash involving public figures and interpretations of Epstein-related controversies.</p>
<h2>International Incidents and Cultural Moments</h2>
<p>In Japan, a tragic accident occurred when a 22-year-old Australian woman became caught on a ski chairlift, remained suspended for a period, and later died from a heart attack. Officials continue to investigate the incident as a reminder of the risks associated with winter sports.</p>
<p>On a lighter but significant note in entertainment, Bad Bunny made Grammy history during a ceremony marked by political statements, including protests against the US immigration agency ICE. Other artists recognized included Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean, and Lady Gaga, showing how music events remain a platform for social and political issues.</p>
<h2>Crime Crackdown in China</h2>
<p>In China, authorities executed four members of the Bai family mafia, who ran scam centres based in Myanmar. This crackdown, publicized by state media, demonstrates China's ongoing fight against organized crime and fraudulent operations that cross national borders.</p>
