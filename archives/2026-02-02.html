    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing limited movement for Palestinians. However, the crossing will permit only a small number of people and no goods to pass in both directions daily. This reopening comes amid ongoing tensions in the region and could affect the humanitarian and political situation in Gaza.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, 80 people who had been kidnapped last month from three churches in Kaduna state have returned home after escaping captivity. The kidnappings were part of a larger wave of violence affecting the area, and the return of these individuals offers some relief for their families and communities.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and Technology</h2>
<p>Ukraine has welcomed what it called "real results" following restrictions imposed by Elon Musk on the use of Russian Starlink internet services. Starlink-enabled drones have been linked to recent deadly attacks by Russia on Ukraine. Limiting this technology's use may impact military operations and the ongoing conflict between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Reporting Challenges in Russia</h2>
<p>Steve Rosenberg, the BBC’s Russia editor, has shared insights into the difficulties faced by journalists reporting in Moscow. British reporters often navigate a challenging environment, balancing the need to ask tough questions about figures like Vladimir Putin while avoiding accusations of being enemies of the state. This highlights the complex media landscape in Russia.</p>
<h2>Norway’s Royal Controversy</h2>
<p>Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has agreed with Princess Mette-Marit's own comments that she showed "poor judgement" in her past contacts with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender. The public acknowledgment reflects ongoing scrutiny of the princess’s associations and their impact on Norway’s royal reputation.</p>
<h2>Notable Events and Human Interest</h2>
<p>At the recent Grammy Awards, a performance marked by political statements saw Bad Bunny make history with a noteworthy achievement. Other winners included Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean, and Lady Gaga. The event was also notable for protests against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).</p>
<p>In a tragic accident in Japan, a 22-year-old Australian woman died after becoming snagged on a ski lift, leading to suspension in midair and a fatal heart attack according to officials.</p>
<p>On a remarkable note of human resilience, a 13-year-old Australian boy swam about 4 kilometers through rough waters to rescue his mother and siblings after they were swept out to sea off the coast of Western Australia. His efforts were widely praised as "superhuman."</p>
<h2>Cultural and Political Responses to the Grammys</h2>
<p>The Dalai Lama won a Grammy in the audiobook category for his meditations, a recognition that Beijing criticized as "manipulation," reflecting ongoing geopolitical sensitivities. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah over a joke made at the ceremony, calling Noah a "total loser," underscoring how entertainment events can stir political controversy.</p>
