    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>Royal Controversy in Norway</h2>
<p>Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has publicly agreed with Princess Mette-Marit's admission that she exercised "poor judgment" over her past contacts with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender. This comes after the princess made remarks acknowledging her mistakes concerning these associations. The issue has drawn attention to the Norwegian royal family and their public image.</p>
<h2>Tensions in Russia Impact Foreign Reporting</h2>
<p>Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's Russia editor, shared insights into the challenges faced by foreign journalists working in Moscow. He described navigating a difficult environment where reporters can be insulted and questioned aggressively, making it a delicate balance to report accurately from Russia. This reflects broader issues about press freedom and diplomatic tensions.</p>
<h2>Gaza-Egypt Border Crossing Reopens with Restrictions</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, a key passage point for Palestinians. However, only a limited number of people—dozens each day—and no goods will be allowed to cross in either direction. This controlled reopening affects daily life in Gaza, impacting movement and access to resources.</p>
<h2>Costa Rica Elects Tough-on-Crime President</h2>
<p>Laura Fernández won Costa Rica's presidential election outright in the first round amid growing public concern about rising organized crime. Her electoral success signals voter preference for strict crime policies as a response to security challenges. This may influence the country's approach to crime prevention and law enforcement going forward.</p>
<h2>Nigerian Hostage Survivors Return Home</h2>
<p>Eighty Nigerians who had been kidnapped from churches in Kaduna state last month have escaped and returned home. The kidnappings involved a total of 177 people and took place in northern Kaduna. The return of these individuals provides some relief amid ongoing security issues in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>A 22-year-old Australian woman tragically died in Japan after becoming caught in a ski lift chair and suffering a heart attack while suspended midair.</p>
<p>In entertainment, the Dalai Lama won a Grammy award in the audiobook category for his meditations, drawing criticism from Beijing, which called the recognition "manipulation."</p>
<p>At the Grammy Awards, performer Bad Bunny made history amid a ceremony marked by political protests against US immigration agency ICE. Other winners included Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean, and Lady Gaga.</p>
<p>In the United States, President Donald Trump threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah over a joke made about Epstein at the Grammys, calling Noah a "total loser."</p>
<p>Finally, a 13-year-old boy off the coast of Australia was hailed as "brave" after swimming 4 kilometers to shore to raise the alarm for his stranded family, who were in danger.</p>
