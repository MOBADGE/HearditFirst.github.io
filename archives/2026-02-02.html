    <h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt has reopened after being closed for some time. However, the crossing will only allow dozens of Palestinians and no goods to pass in either direction each day. This limited reopening could affect movements for Palestinians in Gaza, a region frequently experiencing restrictions. Meanwhile, Syria's only female minister, Hind Kabawat, is working to push for change in the challenging, fragmented post-Assad landscape. She has made clear she does not want to be a symbolic figure but aims to make meaningful improvements in the country.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>A Russian strike in Ukraine killed twelve miners and injured fifteen more. The strike targeted a bus carrying the workers on Sunday, highlighting the ongoing violence in the area. In a separate development related to security, Laura Fernández won Costa Rica’s presidential election in the first round. Her tough stance on crime resonated amid worries about rising organised crime in the country.</p>
<h2>International Law and Justice</h2>
<p>China has executed four members of the Bai family mafia, who were involved in operating scam centres in Myanmar. This action was confirmed by Chinese state media, underlining Beijing’s firm approach to tackling cross-border criminal networks linked to the mafia.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles featured a politically charged atmosphere, with stars using the platform to protest against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Bad Bunny made Grammy history at the event, while other awards went to Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean, and Lady Gaga. The red carpet showcased a wide array of notable fashion looks, reflecting the stars’ high-profile presence amid the politically engaged event.</p>
<h2>Business and Technology</h2>
<p>Starbucks is turning to artificial intelligence in hopes of revitalising its brand and customer experience. Chief Executive Brian Niccol explained that integrating AI technology will help the coffee chain regain its "buzz" as it targets a turnaround in customer engagement. This move reflects a broader trend of businesses adopting advanced technology to innovate and stay competitive.</p>
<h2>Cultural Venues</h2>
<p>The Kennedy Center in the United States will close for two years to undergo renovations. The decision came after several artists cancelled their performances following its recent renaming to the Trump Kennedy Center. This temporary closure aims to refresh the venue but also highlights tensions surrounding its name change and artist participation.</p>
