    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>Royal Controversy in Norway</h2>
<p>Norway's Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, has publicly stated that he agrees with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's own admission of "poor judgement" regarding her past contacts with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The princess had faced scrutiny over these links, and the prime minister's comments come as part of ongoing discussions about the royal family's connections and conduct. The acknowledgment highlights the sensitivity around associations with Epstein and the importance of transparency.</p>
<h2>Middle East Border Update</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, a critical point for movement in and out of Gaza. However, the crossing will operate with strict limitations, allowing only a small number of Palestinians—dozens daily—and no goods to pass through in both directions. This limited reopening signals a cautious approach amid ongoing tensions in the region, affecting humanitarian and economic conditions for people in Gaza.</p>
<h2>Developments in Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukraine has welcomed what it calls "real results" after Elon Musk restricted the use of Starlink internet services by Russian forces. Starlink-enabled drones have reportedly been involved in some recent deadly attacks by Russia on Ukraine, raising concerns about the role of private technology in the conflict. The restricted access may impact Russian military operations dependent on such technology, potentially influencing the course of the conflict.</p>
<h2>Hostage Crisis in Nigeria</h2>
<p>Eighty Nigerians who had been kidnapped from churches in northern Kaduna state have returned home after escaping captivity. They were among 177 people seized in the incident last month, which had drawn significant attention to security issues and the threat of kidnappings in the region. The return of these individuals is a relief for their families and communities but underscores the ongoing need for effective measures against such violent acts.</p>
<h2>Cultural Highlights and Controversies</h2>
<p>At the recent Grammy Awards, several notable moments included the historic win of Bad Bunny and other artists like Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean, and Lady Gaga. However, the event was also marked by protest and political statements, including criticism from Beijing over the Dalai Lama's Grammy win for an audiobook of his meditations, which Chinese authorities labeled as "manipulation." Additionally, US President Donald Trump threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah over a joke made about Epstein during the ceremony, calling Noah a "total loser." These reactions reflect the intersection of entertainment, politics, and international relations at high-profile cultural events.</p>
<h2>Human Interest: Acts of Courage and Tragedy</h2>
<p>A 13-year-old boy off the coast of Western Australia has been hailed as "superhuman" after swimming 4km in rough waters to save his mother and siblings, who had been swept out to sea. His heroic effort highlights resilience and quick thinking in a dangerous situation. Meanwhile, in Japan, an Australian woman tragically died after becoming snagged in a ski lift chair and suspended midair, leading to a fatal heart attack. These stories remind us of both the fragility and courage in everyday life.</p>
