    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>Royal Controversy in Norway</h2>
<p>Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has publicly agreed with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's own admission of "poor judgement" regarding her previous connections with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender. This rare acknowledgement from a senior official highlights ongoing sensitivity about the royal family's associations and the impact they have on public perception. How the controversy might affect the crown princess’s role or Norway’s monarchy remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Reporting Challenges in Russia</h2>
<p>Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's Russia editor, has shared insights on the difficulties faced by foreign journalists working in Moscow. He describes walking a "tightrope" as British reporters navigate a tense environment where they are often insulted or accused of being enemies. This underscores the increasing challenges for independent reporting and press freedom within Russia, affecting the flow of information to the outside world.</p>
<h2>Gaza's Rafah Border Crossing Reopens</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing limited movement. Each day, only dozens of Palestinians are allowed to cross in both directions, and no goods will pass through. The move offers some relief after border closures but leaves ongoing restrictions for Gaza’s population. The limited reopening could indicate a cautious approach to easing tensions in the region while maintaining control over the flow of people and supplies.</p>
<h2>Costa Rica Elects Tough-on-Crime Leader</h2>
<p>Laura Fernández has won Costa Rica's presidential election in the first round, a notable outcome amid rising concerns about organised crime in the country. The result signals public support for stronger measures on security and crime prevention. Fernández's victory may lead to policy changes aimed at addressing crime issues, reflecting citizens’ demands for improved safety.</p>
<h2>Kidnapped Nigerians Return Home Safely</h2>
<p>Eighty Nigerian individuals have returned home after escaping captivity. They were among 177 people abducted last month from three churches in Kaduna state, northern Nigeria. Their safe return is a significant development in a region frequently impacted by kidnappings, and highlights ongoing security challenges. Authorities continue efforts to recover those still missing and to prevent future abductions.</p>
<h2>Grammy Awards Marked by Politics and Historic Win</h2>
<p>At the recent Grammy Awards, artist Bad Bunny made history with a notable win amid a ceremony marked by political statements and protests against the US immigration agency ICE. Other winners included Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean, and Lady Gaga. The event reflected how music and entertainment continue to intersect with social and political issues on a global scale.</p>
<h2>Additional News Highlights</h2>
<p>- The Dalai Lama received a Grammy in the audiobook category for his meditations, though Beijing criticized the award as "manipulation," signaling ongoing tensions regarding the spiritual leader.
- A 22-year-old Australian woman died after becoming caught in a ski lift in Japan, leading to a fatal heart attack while suspended midair.
- A 13-year-old boy in Australia was praised for bravery after swimming 4 km to shore to alert authorities when his family was stranded off the coast, highlighting youthful courage in an emergency situation.
- Former US President Donald Trump threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah over a joke related to Epstein made during the Grammys, branding Noah a "total loser," reflecting ongoing political disputes spilling into entertainment venues.</p>
