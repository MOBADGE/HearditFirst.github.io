    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>Syria's only female minister, Hind Kabawat, is actively working to address the challenges facing a fragmented post-Assad Syria. Kabawat emphasizes she aims to bring meaningful change rather than serve as mere "window dressing," confronting complex political and social issues amid ongoing instability.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a crucial gateway for Palestinians in Gaza. However, the crossing will allow only dozens of people and no goods to pass daily in both directions. This limited reopening marks a cautious easing of restrictions amid ongoing tension in the region.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>A Russian strike near a bus carrying miners in Ukraine killed twelve people and injured fifteen others on Sunday, according to officials. The incident highlights the continuing violence and humanitarian impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>In China, authorities executed four members of the Bai family mafia, known for running scam centers in Myanmar. This move reflects China's intensified efforts to crack down on organized crime operating across borders.</p>
<h2>Politics and Governance</h2>
<p>In Costa Rica, Laura Fernández won the presidential election outright in the first round. Her campaign focused on a tough stance against rising organized crime, a key voter concern. Her victory suggests a public desire for stronger security measures and policy changes in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States is experiencing a partial government shutdown that has entered its third day. The impasse stems from disagreements over Department of Homeland Security funding, with Democrats demanding changes following the fatal shootings of two US citizens during immigration raids. The ongoing shutdown affects government operations and raises concerns about a resolution.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>The Grammy Awards ceremony was notable both for its winners and its political messages. Bad Bunny made history with his win, while other artists such as Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean, and Lady Gaga also took home prizes. The event included protests against US immigration enforcement policies, highlighting the intersection of art and activism.</p>
<p>Fashion highlights from the ceremony showcased standout looks from performers including Chappell Roan and Olivia Dean, drawing attention in Los Angeles.</p>
<h2>US Cultural Institutions</h2>
<p>The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., is set to close for two years for renovations. The decision follows multiple artists canceling performances after the center was renamed the Trump Kennedy Center, signaling ongoing controversy over the venue’s branding and programming. The closure will affect the cultural calendar and audience access in the nation’s capital during this period.</p>
