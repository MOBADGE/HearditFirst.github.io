    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>Royal Controversy in Norway</h2>
<p>Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has publicly agreed with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's admission that she showed "poor judgement" in her past interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender. The princess has acknowledged mistakes in relating to Epstein, which has drawn significant attention. The prime minister’s statement underscores official recognition of the issue and a shared stance on the matter, reflecting its sensitivity in Norway’s public and political spheres.</p>
<h2>Reporting Challenges in Russia</h2>
<p>Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's Russia editor, has shared insights on the complexities and risks involved in reporting from Moscow. Rosenberg describes a challenging environment for foreign journalists, including hostility and suspicion, as well as direct verbal abuse labeling them as "enemies." This atmosphere presents a "tightrope" scenario for accurate journalism, highlighting the ongoing difficulties faced by international media operating under political pressure in Russia.</p>
<h2>Gaza-Egypt Border Crossing Reopens</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on a limited basis. The crossing will allow only dozens of Palestinians to cross daily in both directions, and no goods will be transported. This partial reopening interrupts a previous closure and offers a controlled route for people movement, but the restriction on goods means relief and trade remain constrained, signalling continued tension and limited access for Gaza’s population.</p>
<h2>New President Elected in Costa Rica</h2>
<p>Laura Fernández has won Costa Rica’s presidential election outright in the first round. Her campaign focused on a tough stance against rising organised crime, a growing concern in the country. Her victory indicates public support for stronger measures to address security issues. Fernández’s leadership could signal a shift towards firmer crime policy in Costa Rica moving forward.</p>
<h2>Kidnapped Nigerians Return Home</h2>
<p>Eighty Nigerian hostages have returned safely after escaping captivity. They were part of a group of 177 people seized last month from three churches in Kaduna state, northern Nigeria. Their return marks a significant development in ongoing security challenges related to kidnappings in the region and provides relief to affected families and communities.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In the entertainment world, musician Bad Bunny made history at the Grammy Awards amid a ceremony notable for political statements, including protests against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Other winners included Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean, and Lady Gaga. Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama’s Grammy win for his audiobook of meditations was criticized by Beijing as "manipulation," highlighting geopolitical tensions surrounding the spiritual leader.</p>
<p>In tragic news, a 22-year-old Australian woman died in Japan after becoming trapped in a ski lift and suffering a heart attack while suspended in midair. Separately, a 13-year-old Australian boy was hailed as "superhuman" after swimming four kilometers in rough waters to save his family, who had been swept out to sea off the coast of Western Australia. These human-interest stories underline both the dangers and heroic acts witnessed in recent days around the world.</p>
