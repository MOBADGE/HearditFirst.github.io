    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>As the war between Russia and Ukraine enters its fifth year, Ukraine held nationwide events to honor those who have died since the conflict began. Meanwhile, four Russian soldiers spoke to the BBC about harsh conditions in the war, revealing troubling incidents. Two of them reported witnessing fellow soldiers executed on the orders of their commanders for refusing to follow orders. These accounts highlight the ongoing challenges and human cost of the fighting, which shows no clear resolution in sight.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns in Mexico and Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Mexico, authorities are searching for 23 inmates who escaped a prison in Puerto Vallarta. The prisoners were freed after armed men broke into the facility and rammed one of its gates. The escape adds pressure on security forces already combating violence in the region. Over in Nigeria, the government denied reports that it paid a large ransom to free students after a mass abduction. The statement came just before the police chief announced he would resign more than a year before his term ends, indicating potential unrest or changes within the police service.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters in Brazil and the US</h2>
<p>Severe weather events caused multiple casualties this week. In Brazil, floods and landslides around Juiz de Fora displaced hundreds of people and killed at least 20. Rescue operations are ongoing to find dozens still missing. Meanwhile, a historic winter storm in the US northeast resulted in two deaths when a tree fell onto a car. The storm also disrupted transportation, delaying flights and leaving thousands without power. These natural disasters emphasize vulnerabilities to extreme weather across different regions.</p>
<h2>Health and Wildlife</h2>
<p>A health scare at a Thai tourist park led to the deaths of 72 tigers, prompting an official investigation. Tests detected the canine distemper virus, but its origin remains unclear. Such outbreaks are concerning because of their impact on wildlife populations and tourist industries. In the United States, celebrity doctor Peter Attia stepped down from CBS amid revelations about his past connections to Jeffrey Epstein. His spokesperson said the decision was intended to prevent this association from becoming a distraction to his work.</p>
<h2>Missing Person Case</h2>
<p>In a human interest story, the family of missing woman Nancy Guthrie has offered a $1 million reward for information about her whereabouts. Her daughter, an NBC host, emotionally expressed acceptance that her mother may no longer be alive. The family’s appeal keeps attention on the unresolved case, hoping that new leads might emerge.</p>
