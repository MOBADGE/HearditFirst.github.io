    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine and Russia</h2>
<p>As the war in Ukraine reaches its fourth year, new accounts from Russian soldiers have emerged revealing harsh and brutal conditions. Four soldiers spoke to the BBC about witnessing executions of fellow troops following orders from commanders. Two of these men described seeing soldiers being shot for refusing to follow orders, highlighting a climate of fear and severe discipline within Russian forces. At the same time, Ukraine remains defiant despite ongoing fighting, with little indication that a ceasefire is imminent.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Weather Disrupts US East Coast</h2>
<p>A powerful snowstorm has dumped more than a foot of snow across parts of the US east coast, causing widespread travel disruption and power outages. More than 5,000 flights have been cancelled as authorities work to clear roads and restore services. The storm's impact is a major challenge for residents and transportation networks in affected areas.</p>
<h2>Wildlife Health Crisis in Thailand</h2>
<p>A troubling outbreak has killed 72 tigers at a tourist park in Thailand. Authorities have identified the cause as the canine distemper virus but have not confirmed how the infection started. Investigations are ongoing to understand the source of the disease and prevent further loss among the endangered big cats.</p>
<h2>Political and Security Developments</h2>
<p>In Ghana, the main international airport's name has been changed to remove reference to the coup leader Kotoka on the anniversary of his putsch. Supporters of the renaming said the former name conflicted with the country's democratic values.</p>
<p>In Moscow, an explosion at a rail hub has been confirmed as a suicide bombing that killed a traffic police officer and the suspect. Russian officials continue to investigate the attack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong has lodged a strong protest after Panama's Supreme Court canceled contracts held by a Hong Kong-based firm, leading Panama to take control of canal ports last month. The dispute reflects ongoing tensions in international commercial and territorial matters.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural News</h2>
<p>The entertainment world mourns the death of Robert Carradine, best known for his role in "Revenge of the Nerds" and "Lizzie McGuire." His family shared that he died aged 71 and had endured bipolar disorder for nearly 20 years before taking his own life.</p>
<p>Also, celebrity doctor and health influencer Peter Attia has stepped down from his role at CBS to avoid his past association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein becoming a distraction. His representative stated this decision was made to maintain focus on his professional work.</p>
<h2>Unrest in Mexico After Cartel Leader Death</h2>
<p>Violence has erupted across several Mexican states following the killing of cartel leader El Mencho. Reports from both locals and tourists describe scenes of destruction, with buildings burned and communities unsettled. The unrest illustrates ongoing challenges in controlling organized crime and maintaining public security in the region.</p>
