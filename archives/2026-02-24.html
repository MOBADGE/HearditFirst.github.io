    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 24, 2026</div>
    <h2>War and Conflict</h2>
<p>Four Russian soldiers recently spoke to the BBC about severe conditions in the Ukraine conflict, revealing that some troops were executed on orders from their commanders for refusing to follow orders. This account highlights harsh disciplinary measures amid the ongoing war, which has now entered its fifth year. Meanwhile, across Ukraine, numerous events were held to remember those who have died since Russia's full-scale invasion began four years ago. These commemorations reflect the continuing impact and human cost of the conflict on Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>In Mexico, authorities are searching for 23 inmates who escaped from a prison in Puerto Vallarta. The breakout occurred after armed individuals rammed one of the jail's gates, allowing the prisoners to flee. This escape is part of a recent surge of violence in the area, raising concerns about local security and public safety. In Nigeria, officials denied reports that a large ransom was paid to free pupils abducted in a mass kidnapping. The denial came shortly before the announcement that the police chief plans to resign one year before the end of his term, suggesting possible internal issues within the country's law enforcement leadership.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>Severe weather has caused significant damage in two regions. In Juiz de Fora, Brazil, recent floods and landslides have resulted in at least 25 deaths, with many more people displaced and dozens still missing. Rescue operations are ongoing as the community deals with this disaster. In the United States, a historic winter storm battered the Northeast, causing widespread travel disruptions, power outages, and the deaths of two people when a tree fell on their vehicle. These events underscore the continuing threat of extreme weather globally and the challenges it poses for affected populations.</p>
<h2>Health and Environment</h2>
<p>A health crisis at a tourist park in Thailand has led to the deaths of 72 tigers, with authorities conducting an investigation into the cause. Tests indicate the presence of the canine distemper virus, though the source of the infection remains unknown. This outbreak raises concerns about wildlife health and the management of animals in captivity.</p>
<h2>Notable Personal News</h2>
<p>Peter Attia, a prominent doctor and health influencer, has stepped down from his role at CBS. His spokesperson stated that Mr. Attia wishes to prevent his past association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein from becoming a distraction. In a separate personal case, the family of Nancy Guthrie, an NBC host, has offered a $1 million reward to help find her after she went missing. Despite the reward and ongoing efforts, her daughter has emotionally acknowledged the possibility that her mother may no longer be alive.</p>
<h2>Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and France have prompted talks between the US ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, and the French foreign minister. Kushner had not responded to a summons earlier in the week but has since engaged in discussions, reflecting ongoing diplomatic efforts to manage disagreements between the two countries.</p>
