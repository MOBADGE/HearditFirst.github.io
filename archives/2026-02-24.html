    <h2>War in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the war continues to take a heavy toll. Events were held across Ukraine to remember those who have died since the conflict began. Meanwhile, four Russian soldiers spoke to the BBC about the war’s harsh realities. Two of them described witnessing fellow soldiers being executed after refusing orders, pointing to severe discipline and brutality within Russian forces. This testimony sheds new light on the conditions faced by soldiers on the ground, underscoring the ongoing human cost of the war as it enters its fifth year.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security in Mexico and Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Mexico, authorities are searching for 23 inmates who escaped from a jail in Puerto Vallarta. Their escape came after armed men rammed one of the jail’s gates during a surge of violence in the region. This incident highlights ongoing challenges in maintaining security amid rising criminal activity.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, government officials denied reports that a large ransom was paid to free a group of abducted school pupils. The denial was followed by the announcement that the police chief would be stepping down one year before his term was set to end. These developments suggest continued difficulties in dealing with kidnappings and violence affecting education and public safety.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Weather</h2>
<p>Severe weather has caused significant damage and loss of life this week in different parts of the world. In Brazil, heavy floods and landslides in Juiz de Fora have killed at least 20 people. Hundreds more have been displaced, and dozens remain missing as rescue efforts continue.</p>
<p>In the northeastern United States, a historic winter storm has led to two fatalities after a tree fell on a car. The storm also disrupted travel, delaying flights and leaving thousands of people without power, illustrating the challenges posed by extreme winter weather.</p>
<h2>Health and Wildlife</h2>
<p>A troubling outbreak has caused the deaths of 72 tigers at a tourist park in Thailand. Investigators identified the canine distemper virus in samples taken from the animals but have yet to determine how the virus entered the park. The incident raises concerns about disease management and animal health in wildlife tourism facilities.</p>
<h2>High-Profile News</h2>
<p>Nancy Guthrie’s family has offered a $1 million reward to help find the missing woman. Her daughter, an NBC host, expressed deep sadness and said they accept that Nancy may be dead. This remains a developing and emotional case attracting public attention.</p>
<p>In the United States, celebrity doctor Peter Attia has stepped down from his role at CBS amidst scrutiny over his past associations with Jeffrey Epstein. His spokesperson said the decision was to prevent the connection from becoming a distraction, reflecting how public figures are managing the impact of such revelations.</p>
<p>Lastly, diplomatic tensions between the US and France saw a development as Charles Kushner, the US ambassador to France, held talks with France’s foreign minister after initially not responding to a summons. These conversations could be important for resolving recent disagreements between the two countries.</p>
