    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Four Russian soldiers who are now on the run have revealed harsh and violent conditions experienced by troops during the conflict in Ukraine. They described witnessing fellow soldiers being executed by their own commanders for refusing orders. This account highlights the severe pressures and brutality on the Russian side of the war, which has been ongoing for four years since the full-scale invasion began. Despite the hardship, Ukraine remains defiant, and a ceasefire still seems unlikely in the near future.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Weather Disrupts US Travel</h2>
<p>A significant snowstorm has hit the US East Coast, dropping over a foot of snow in some areas. The storm caused widespread disruption, including power outages and the cancellation of more than 5,000 flights. Residents and travelers are coping with the challenges of the severe weather, while authorities work to clear roads and restore services.</p>
<h2>Violence and Unrest in Mexico</h2>
<p>Several states in Mexico have experienced outbreaks of violence following the recent killing of a cartel leader known as El Mencho. Major cities like Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, have seen increased unrest, leaving locals and tourists deeply unsettled. The situation is tense, and BBC correspondent Will Grant reports that people are feeling anxious as the authorities respond to the disturbances.</p>
<h2>Tiger Deaths at Thai Tourist Park</h2>
<p>A deadly illness has killed 72 tigers in a tourist park in Thailand. Samples taken from the animals indicate the presence of the canine distemper virus, although officials have not yet determined how the infection began. Authorities are conducting an investigation to understand and control the outbreak, which has raised concerns about animal health and safety at the facility.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings Against Former Philippine Leader</h2>
<p>Judges at the International Criminal Court have begun hearing charges against former Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte. He is accused of being responsible for widespread killings during a long-running and violent war on drugs in the country. The hearings mark a significant step in the international case examining allegations of serious human rights abuses.</p>
<h2>Notable Death in Entertainment</h2>
<p>Robert Carradine, an actor known for his roles in "Lizzie McGuire" and "Revenge of the Nerds," has died at the age of 71.
