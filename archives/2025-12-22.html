    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 22, 2025</div>
    <h2>Security and Crime Developments</h2>
<p>Police released documents related to the recent deadly shooting by gunmen in Bondi, alleging that the suspects "meticulously" planned the attack over several months. The files trace the movements of those involved in the incident, offering insight into the preparation behind the tragedy. This information may be important for ongoing investigations and efforts to prevent similar future attacks.</p>
<p>In Moscow, a Russian general named Fanil Sarvarov was reportedly killed by a car bomb. Sarvarov was head of the armed forces' operational training department, according to the Russian Investigative Committee. The circumstances and motives behind the assassination have not been detailed but highlight continuing instability and violence affecting officials in Russia.</p>
<h2>International Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Discussions between the US and Ukraine regarding peace efforts were described as productive, although no major breakthroughs were achieved. Steve Witkoff, special envoy for Donald Trump, and Ukraine's top negotiator jointly issued a statement following their Miami talks. While no immediate agreement resulted, the dialogue indicates ongoing engagement between the two sides in search of conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel authorized the construction of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. This decision was supported by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said the move aimed to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. The approval could further complicate the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and impact peace efforts.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to hold talks to try to end a deadly conflict that has killed at least 41 people and displaced nearly one million across the border region. The agreement marks a step toward resolving the humanitarian crisis caused by the fighting on both sides.</p>
<h2>US Domestic and Foreign Policy Updates</h2>
<p>The US government is pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela, following President Donald Trump's recent order to blockade sanctioned tankers entering or leaving the country. The continued enforcement of these sanctions reflects ongoing tensions regarding Venezuela's government and international trade regulations.</p>
<p>In the United States, a photo featuring Donald Trump that had been removed from the justice department's website due to concerns from victims was reinstated after public backlash. The image was part of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. This decision suggests an ongoing debate over how sensitive material related to high-profile individuals is handled and presented by government entities.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Community News</h2>
<p>Authorities in Nigeria confirmed that all students kidnapped from a Catholic school in Niger state last month have now been released. This marks an important development in efforts to combat school kidnappings and enhance security for students in the region.</p>
<p>In the US, an abortion clinic located in a town divided by two states is facing an eviction notice amid ongoing efforts to shut it down. The clinic is the only one in the area and is at the center of a broader debate on abortion access and rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Cultural Events</h2>
<p>Croatia's capital city aims to host one of Europe's best Christmas markets this season. With festive events drawing millions of tourists, the market helps raise the city's profile and attract visitors during the holiday period, supporting local businesses and tourism.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These developments highlight a mix of security concerns, diplomatic efforts, policy enforcement, and cultural activities shaping the international and domestic news landscape today.</p>
