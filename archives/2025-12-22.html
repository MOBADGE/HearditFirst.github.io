    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 22, 2025</div>
    <h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>Australian police have released documents alleging that the gunmen involved in the deadly Bondi shooting meticulously planned their attack over several months. The materials trace the suspects' movements leading up to the incident, providing insight into the preparation behind what authorities describe as a premeditated act. Understanding these details may help law enforcement prevent similar attacks in the future.</p>
<p>In Moscow, a Russian general named Fanil Sarvarov, who led the armed forces' operational training department, was killed by a car bomb, according to Russia's Investigative Committee. The attack marks a significant incident given Sarvarov’s military role, highlighting ongoing security challenges within the country.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Conflict</h2>
<p>Discussions between the United States and Ukraine in Miami have been described as productive, although no major breakthroughs were announced. The talks involved Steve Witkoff, a special envoy appointed by President Donald Trump, meeting with Ukraine’s top negotiator to discuss the latest peace proposals. The meetings indicate ongoing efforts to find a diplomatic solution despite persistent difficulties on the ground.</p>
<p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to hold talks aimed at ending a deadly conflict that has left at least 41 dead and nearly one million displaced people on both sides. Officials hope that these negotiations will lead to a peaceful resolution after months of tension and violence impacting border communities.</p>
<p>Israel has approved the construction of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. The move was supported by Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who stated it was intended to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. This decision may affect future peace efforts and contribute to regional tensions.</p>
<h2>Domestic Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, the Department of Justice reinstated an image in the Epstein files featuring Donald Trump after backlash regarding its earlier removal. A US official said several images had been taken down initially due to concerns raised by victims. The reinstatement reflects ongoing sensitivities around the handling of evidence in high-profile cases.</p>
<p>A US official also reported efforts to pursue a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela, following President Donald Trump’s order to block sanctioned tankers entering and leaving the country. This move signals continued US enforcement of sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry amid broader geopolitical pressures.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian News</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, officials confirm that all pupils kidnapped from a Catholic school in Niger state last month have been released. The safe return of the remaining students is a relief after weeks of uncertainty and highlights ongoing security challenges for schools in parts of the country.</p>
<p>In the United States, the only abortion clinic in a town divided between two states is currently fighting an eviction notice amid other efforts to close it down. This situation reflects the ongoing, complex debates over abortion access in areas heavily affected by recent political and legal changes.</p>
<h2>Culture and Tourism</h2>
<p>Croatia’s capital city is aiming to host Europe’s best Christmas market, emphasizing how festive events can attract millions of tourists and boost city profiles. These cultural activities play a key role in promoting tourism during the holiday season and help cities stand out on the regional map.</p>
