    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 22, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The United States has expressed interest in Greenland, with former US President Donald Trump stating the country "has to have" Greenland and appointing a special envoy for this purpose. Denmark, which governs Greenland, has firmly warned Washington to respect its sovereignty. Greenland itself emphasized that it will determine its own future, signaling that any potential discussions over its status will involve the Arctic territory's own decision-making.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thailand and Cambodia are set to hold ceasefire talks after violent clashes resulted in at least 41 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. Officials on both sides are preparing to negotiate in hopes of ending ongoing hostilities along their border.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine’s Odesa region, a critical area for Ukraine’s maritime logistics. President Volodymyr Zelensky described the escalation as an effort by Moscow to block Ukraine’s access to sea routes, which are vital for trade and supply chains. This development marks a serious challenge to Ukraine’s ability to sustain its economy and military operations.</p>
<h2>Security in Russia</h2>
<p>Moscow has experienced a targeted attack on a high-ranking military official. Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb, marking the third assassination of senior military personnel in the Russian capital over the past year. This incident underscores ongoing security vulnerabilities and potential internal conflicts within Russia.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns in Gaza</h2>
<p>One-year-old Siwar Ashour, who was evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment during the Gaza conflict, has returned to a hospital in Gaza. The BBC has followed her story, highlighting the ongoing difficulties faced by civilians, particularly children, in war-affected areas.</p>
<p>International non-governmental organizations (NGOs) delivering aid to Gaza face new challenges due to Israeli government registration requirements. NGOs that are not registered by December 31 face potential closure in Israel. However, the Israeli government insists that aid delivery will remain uninterrupted despite these administrative obstacles. The situation raises concerns about the continuity of humanitarian operations in Gaza amid tightening regulations.</p>
<h2>Economy and Markets</h2>
<p>Global investors are increasingly turning to precious metals for security amid geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. Gold and silver prices have reached record highs as traders anticipate further cuts in US interest rates. This flight to safe-haven assets reflects broader worries about global political stability and economic prospects.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Ecuador, four soldiers were sentenced to 34 years in prison for the forced disappearance and murder of four boys. The boys had been detained by a military patrol, and their bodies were found mutilated and burned. This verdict highlights ongoing issues related to military conduct and human rights in the region.</p>
<p>In France, a staff member at the Élysée Palace is scheduled to stand trial for the theft of valuable silver and porcelain used in state banquets. The accused, named Thomas M, is charged with stealing precious items from the presidential residence, raising questions about security within official state institutions.</p>
<h2>Recovery and Local News</h2>
<p>The Spanish town of La Bañeza, which suffered damage from wildfires this summer, has received a substantial win of €468 million in the country’s Christmas lottery. This fortunate event may provide much-needed support as the community continues its recovery efforts following the natural disaster.</p>
