    <h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>Police have revealed that the gunmen involved in the deadly Bondi shooting had meticulously planned the attack for several months. Authorities released documents tracking the suspects’ movements leading up to the event, shedding light on the preparation behind the violence. In response, Australia is fast-tracking new gun and protest laws aimed at preventing similar incidents. However, these moves have prompted criticism from civil liberties groups who argue the laws could harm democracy and unfairly target gun owners.</p>
<p>In Moscow, a Russian general named Fanil Sarvarov, who headed the armed forces' operational training department, was killed by a car bomb. Russian officials confirmed the death, raising concerns about ongoing security threats within the country.</p>
<h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Tensions have flared between the US and Denmark after the naming of a US envoy to Greenland. Denmark issued a warning for Washington to respect its sovereignty, while Greenland emphasized that it will independently decide its political future. This development adds to existing diplomatic challenges involving the Arctic region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US and Ukraine held talks in Miami aimed at advancing peace plans. Although no major breakthroughs were announced, officials described the discussions as productive. Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Ukraine’s top negotiator jointly issued a statement reflecting cautious optimism about ongoing diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Regional Conflicts and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Cambodia are set to hold ceasefire talks following recent clashes that have resulted in at least 41 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. This step could mark the beginning of de-escalation in a conflict that has heavily impacted communities on both sides of the border.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>US lawmakers from both parties threatened legal action against the Attorney General over the handling of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. The lawmakers leading calls for transparency accuse the Justice Department of failing to meet its legal obligations to release information about the Epstein case. This conflict highlights ongoing tensions over government accountability and the handling of sensitive legal matters.</p>
<p>Separately, the US is actively pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela, following President Donald Trump’s order to block sanctioned oil tankers from entering or leaving the country. This action is part of broader efforts to enforce sanctions on Venezuela amid international disputes.</p>
<h2>Economy and Markets</h2>
<p>Global investors are driving gold prices higher, with the precious metal recently surpassing $4,400 per ounce, a record high. This surge is attributed to rising geopolitical tensions and expectations of further US interest rate cuts, which typically increase demand for safe-haven assets like gold.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian News</h2>
<p>In a positive development from Nigeria, authorities confirmed that all the pupils kidnapped from a Catholic school in Niger state last month have been released. This announcement brings relief after a period of uncertainty and highlights ongoing security challenges in the region.</p>
