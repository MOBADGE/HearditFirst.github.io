    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 22, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high over Greenland after former U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States "has to have" Greenland, following the naming of a special envoy for the region. Denmark has responded by warning Washington to respect its sovereignty, while Greenland has emphasized that it will decide its own future independently. This dispute highlights ongoing complexities in Arctic geopolitics.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Cambodia are preparing to hold ceasefire talks amid ongoing conflict that has resulted in at least 41 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. Officials from both countries have indicated a willingness to negotiate in hopes of ending the violence that has affected communities on both sides of the border.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In Russia, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov has been killed in a car bomb attack in Moscow, marking the third high-ranking military official targeted in similar attacks over the past year. The circumstances of the attack have raised concerns about security within the capital and possible underlying political tensions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned of intensified Russian attacks on the key maritime region of Odesa. The assaults are interpreted as efforts by Moscow to block Ukraine's access to important sea logistics, which is crucial for the country’s economy and military supply routes.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>International aid organizations operating in Gaza face uncertainty as Israel has set a December 31 deadline for registration. Those not registered by this date risk closure. While many aid groups fear this could lead to the collapse of crucial operations in the area, the Israeli government insists that aid delivery will not be affected.</p>
<p>A human interest story from Gaza follows one-year-old Siwar Ashour, who was evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment during the Gaza war and has now returned to a hospital in Gaza. This highlights ongoing medical and humanitarian challenges in the region due to the conflict.</p>
<p>In Ecuador, four soldiers have been sentenced to 34 years in prison for the forced disappearance and murder of four boys. The boys were detained by a military patrol, and their mutilated and burned bodies were later discovered. This case underscores ongoing issues of justice and military accountability in the country.</p>
<h2>Economy and Society</h2>
<p>The Spanish town of La Bañeza has won €468 million in the country’s Christmas lottery. The town, with about 11,000 residents, was severely affected by wildfires during the summer. This significant lottery win is likely to provide a financial boost to a community still recovering from natural disaster.</p>
<p>Investors worldwide are increasingly turning to precious metals, with gold and silver reaching record prices. This surge in demand is driven by geopolitical uncertainties and expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further, prompting many to seek safety in these traditional assets.</p>
<h2>Crime and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>In France, a staff member at the Élysée Palace is set to stand trial accused of stealing valuable items used for official state banquets, including solid silver and porcelain. The case raises concerns about security and trust within key French government institutions.</p>
