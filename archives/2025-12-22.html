    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 22, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>A new United States envoy appointed by President Donald Trump has expressed a goal of incorporating Greenland into the US. This announcement has drawn warnings from Denmark, which urges Washington to respect the sovereignty of Greenland. Meanwhile, Greenland's own authorities emphasize that the territory will decide its own future, highlighting ongoing tensions about control and self-determination.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Cambodia are preparing to hold ceasefire talks following prolonged violence in their border region. The conflict has resulted in at least 41 deaths and forced nearly one million people to flee their homes on both sides. The upcoming negotiations are seen as an important step toward resolving a humanitarian crisis affecting a large population.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>In Moscow, a high-ranking Russian military official, Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, was killed in a car bomb attack. He is the third senior military figure to be targeted in such attacks in the Russian capital over the past year, underscoring ongoing security concerns within Russia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia has intensified its military attacks on the strategic Ukrainian region of Odesa. President Volodymyr Zelensky characterized these offensive actions as attempts by Moscow to block Ukraine’s access to maritime logistics, which are vital for the country's economy and wartime supply lines.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>International aid organizations working in Israel face uncertainty due to new registration rules that require them to be officially registered by December 31 or risk being forced to close. Although the Israeli government insists that aid deliveries will not be interrupted, NGOs warn this could jeopardize critical operations, particularly in Gaza.</p>
<p>In Gaza, the BBC revisited one-year-old Siwar Ashour, who was evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment during the recent war. She has since returned to a hospital in Gaza, highlighting ongoing challenges for civilians requiring medical care in the conflict zone.</p>
<h2>Justice and Accountability</h2>
<p>In Ecuador, four soldiers were sentenced to 34 years in prison over the forced disappearance and brutal murder of four boys. The boys had been taken by a military patrol, and their bodies were later found mutilated and burned. The verdict marks a significant moment in addressing human rights abuses by the military.</p>
<h2>Economy and Finance</h2>
<p>Global investors are increasingly turning to precious metals, with gold and silver prices reaching record highs. This surge is driven by geopolitical tensions worldwide and expectations of further interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, as investors look for safe haven assets amid uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Community and Culture</h2>
<p>The town of La Bañeza in Spain, which suffered from summer wildfires, recently won €468 million in the country’s Christmas lottery. With a population of around 11,000, this win offers a significant boost to the community, potentially aiding in recovery and rebuilding efforts after the fire damage.</p>
<p>In France, a staff member of the Élysée Palace is set to stand trial for allegedly stealing solid silver and porcelain tableware used for state banquets. The case highlights ongoing concerns about security and accountability within important state institutions.</p>
