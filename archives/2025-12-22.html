    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 22, 2025</div>
    <h2>Security and Violence</h2>
<p>Police have released documents suggesting the gunmen involved in the deadly Bondi shooting planned the attack carefully over several months. The release aims to shed light on the suspects' movements before the incident. Meanwhile, in Moscow, Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb, marking the third attack on military officials in the Russian capital this year. These events highlight ongoing concerns about planned violence and targeted attacks in different regions.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Tensions have risen around Greenland after a new envoy appointed by former US President Donald Trump said he would work to make Greenland part of the United States. Denmark responded by warning Washington to respect its sovereignty, while Greenland emphasized that it will determine its own future. Additionally, the foreign ministers of Thailand and Cambodia announced plans to hold ceasefire talks following clashes that have killed at least 41 people and displaced nearly one million others. These diplomatic efforts reflect ongoing struggles over territory and peace in various parts of the world.</p>
<h2>US Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, lawmakers from both parties have threatened legal action against the Attorney General over the handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The lawmakers accuse the Department of Justice of not fulfilling its legal obligations regarding transparency in the case. Meanwhile, US officials are pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela, following President Trump's directive to block sanctioned tankers from entering or leaving the country. These developments show continued political and legal tensions in Washington.</p>
<h2>Economic Trends</h2>
<p>Investors are increasingly turning to gold and silver, driving these precious metals to record prices. This trend is linked to geopolitical tensions worldwide and expectations that the US may cut interest rates further. The movement toward safe-haven assets signals uncertainty in global markets and a cautious approach from investors amid economic and political challenges.</p>
<h2>Education and Humanitarian Updates</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, officials have confirmed that all students kidnapped from a Catholic school in Niger state last month have now been released. This development brings relief after a period of concern over the students' safety. The situation underscores ongoing security challenges faced by communities in the region.</p>
<h2>Domestic Policy Debates in Australia</h2>
<p>Following the Bondi shooting, Australia is moving quickly to introduce new gun control and protest laws. However, these efforts have drawn criticism from civil liberties advocates who argue the laws could harm democracy and unfairly target gun owners. This debate highlights the balance governments seek between security measures and protecting individual rights.</p>
