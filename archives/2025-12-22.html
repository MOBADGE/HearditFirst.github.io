    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The United States has appointed a new special envoy with the stated goal of making Greenland part of the US, a move that has drawn a response from Denmark and Greenland. Denmark warned Washington to respect its sovereignty, emphasizing the importance of international norms. Meanwhile, Greenland asserted it will decide its own future independently. This development could affect US-Denmark relations and has implications for Arctic geopolitics, where Greenland’s strategic location plays a key role.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Moscow authorities reported that Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb, marking the third time in the past year that a high-ranking military official has died from bomb attacks in Russia’s capital. The incident highlights ongoing security concerns within Moscow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thailand and Cambodia are preparing for ceasefire talks amid ongoing conflict that has led to at least 41 deaths and displaced nearly one million people on both sides. These talks are seen as a critical opportunity to reduce violence and address the humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>In Miami, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and a top Ukrainian negotiator described their recent discussions on peace plans as productive, despite no major breakthroughs. Their meeting marks continued diplomatic efforts to seek resolution in Ukraine, although challenges remain.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>In France, a staff member at the Élysée Palace, identified as Thomas M, is set to stand trial for allegedly stealing precious tableware used during state banquets. The items include solid silver and porcelain, underscoring concerns about security within prominent institutions.</p>
<p>In the United States, bipartisan lawmakers have threatened legal action against the Attorney General over what they say was the Justice Department’s failure to meet legal obligations related to the release of files on Jeffrey Epstein. This dispute centers on demands for transparency and accountability.</p>
<h2>Domestic Security and Legislation</h2>
<p>In Australia, police investigations into the deadly Bondi shooting revealed that the gunmen had meticulously planned the attack for months. Authorities released documents tracing the suspects' movements before the incident. Following this event, the government is fast-tracking new laws on guns and protests. However, these proposed laws are drawing criticism from civil liberties groups, who argue the measures could harm democratic rights and unfairly target gun owners.</p>
<h2>Economy and Markets</h2>
<p>Precious metals such as gold and silver have reached record prices as investors seek safe assets amid continuing geopolitical tensions and expectations of additional US interest rate cuts. The surge in demand for these metals reflects broader concerns about economic stability and uncertainty in global markets.</p>
