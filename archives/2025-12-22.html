    <h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Donald Trump’s newly appointed special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has declared his intention to help make Greenland part of the United States. This statement has met warnings from Denmark to respect its sovereignty, while Greenland emphasized that it will independently decide its own future. The issue highlights ongoing tensions around territorial sovereignty and US interest in the Arctic region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, talks between the United States and Ukraine in Miami were described as productive, although no major breakthroughs were reached. The discussions, involving Witkoff and Ukraine’s chief negotiator, focused on advancing peace plans amid ongoing conflict. The progress, while limited, suggests continued diplomatic efforts are underway.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>In Russia, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb in Moscow. He is reported to be the third military official eliminated in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the past year, indicating heightened risks and instability affecting senior figures.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Cambodia are preparing for ceasefire talks after recent clashes resulted in at least 41 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. The talks aim to reduce tensions and stem the humanitarian crisis affecting communities on both sides of their border.</p>
<h2>Crime and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>In France, a staff member at the Élysée Palace, identified as Thomas M, is set to stand trial for allegedly stealing precious silver and porcelain tableware used in state banquets. The case has drawn attention to security measures within presidential institutions.</p>
<p>In Australia, police have released documents alleging that gunmen involved in the Bondi shooting had engaged in meticulous planning over several months prior to the attack. The evidence is part of ongoing investigations into the deadly shooting, shedding light on the suspects’ preparations.</p>
<h2>Economy and Markets</h2>
<p>Amid geopolitical uncertainties and expectations that the US will lower interest rates, investors are increasingly turning to precious metals as safe-haven assets. Gold and silver prices have hit record highs, signaling market anxiety and a search for stability during uncertain economic conditions.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Society</h2>
<p>The BBC revisited one-year-old Siwar Ashour in Gaza, who was temporarily evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment amid the Gaza war. The ongoing coverage highlights the lingering human impact of the conflict and the challenges faced by affected families.</p>
<p>In West Africa, officials in Ghana have rejected the label "Detty December," a phrase commonly used to describe the country’s and Nigeria’s end-of-year party seasons. The rejection reflects a desire to present a different perspective on cultural celebrations and social behavior during this period.</p>
