    <h2>Protests and Healthcare Crisis in Iran</h2>
<p>Medical workers in Iran report that hospitals are overwhelmed as widespread protests continue across the country. The unrest has been met with an intensified crackdown by authorities. The situation in medical facilities reflects the heavy toll the protests are having on the population, with many injured requiring urgent care. The government’s response suggests the protests may persist amid mounting tensions.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Tensions Over Greenland</h2>
<p>Former US leader Donald Trump has suggested that the United States should "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from gaining influence there. He stated the US could acquire it "the easy way" or "the hard way." However, Denmark, which governs Greenland, has firmly rejected the idea, saying the territory is not for sale. Meanwhile, residents of Greenland express concern about their future, wanting a greater role in decisions affecting their relationship with Denmark and their place in global affairs. This standoff highlights growing international interest in the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>Minneapolis Shooting Captured on Video</h2>
<p>A video has emerged showing the moments before a Minneapolis street shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who fired shots. The footage provides a clearer view of the incident, which is under investigation. The release of such videos often influences public dialogue about law enforcement practices and accountability.</p>
<h2>Swiss Ski Resort Fire and Aftermath</h2>
<p>A devastating fire on New Year's Eve at a bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, has left 40 people dead and 116 injured. Survivors and rescuers described the scene as "apocalyptic." A woman named Marie who witnessed the event from across the street helped injured patrons flee the flames. The tragedy has prompted soul-searching in Switzerland and questions about safety regulations at popular ski resorts. Memorial services are being held as the community grieves.</p>
<h2>Landfill Collapse in the Philippines</h2>
<p>Rescue efforts are ongoing in the central Philippines following a deadly landslide at a landfill site, where a massive pile of rubbish suddenly collapsed. Dozens of people remain missing as teams work to find survivors amid the debris. This disaster underscores the risks posed by poorly managed waste disposal sites and the urgent need for improved safety measures.</p>
<h2>Cultural Connections Through Citizenship</h2>
<p>US film actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after undergoing DNA testing to trace their African heritage. They join other American celebrities who are formally reconnecting with ancestral roots and adopting citizenship in African countries. This movement highlights a growing trend of cultural and personal identity exploration through legal and symbolic affiliations.</p>
