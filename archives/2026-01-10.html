    <h2>Protests and Violence in Iran and the US</h2>
<p>In Iran, hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties amid ongoing protests. Medics report hundreds of people have been killed or injured by security forces, with more than 70 bodies brought to just one hospital. The situation is described as dire, with little time even to perform CPR on victims. Meanwhile, in Minneapolis and other US cities, protests continue following the death of Renee Good. Dozens of people have been arrested in connection with the protests, and one police officer was injured during the unrest. These events highlight ongoing tensions and public unrest in multiple parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Tragic Landfill Collapse in the Philippines</h2>
<p>Rescue teams in the central Philippines are working to find dozens of people missing after a large-scale landslide at a landfill site. The disaster occurred when a mountain of rubbish suddenly collapsed. Efforts are underway to locate survivors, but the situation remains critical. This incident brings attention to the dangers faced by communities living or working near waste disposal sites.</p>
<h2>Legal Dispute Over Death of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Son</h2>
<p>The family of author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has accused a hospital in Lagos of negligence following the death of her 21-month-old son. The hospital has denied any medical negligence. This ongoing dispute raises concerns about healthcare standards and accountability in the medical system.</p>
<h2>US and International Tensions over Greenland and Venezuela</h2>
<p>In a statement, Donald Trump emphasized the strategic importance of Greenland, saying the US needs to "own" the territory to prevent Russia and China from gaining influence there. He mentioned the US would acquire it "the easy way" or "the hard way," but Denmark, which governs Greenland, has firmly stated that the territory is not for sale. In another economic matter, Trump has proposed a $100 billion investment in Venezuela's oil sector. However, oil executives expressed skepticism, noting that Venezuela has seized their assets twice before, which complicates the country's investment appeal.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Entertainment News</h2>
<p>A rare first edition of Action Comics No 1, which introduced Superman, recently sold for $15 million. This comic is one of fewer than 100 known copies worldwide, making it a highly valuable collectible. Separately, US actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after DNA tests confirmed their heritage. They join other US celebrities who are reconnecting with their African roots through citizenship.</p>
<h2>Additional News: Swiss Ski Bar Fire</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, a memorial was held after a fire at a ski bar in Crans-Montana. A woman named Marie, who was in a nearby bar opposite Le Constellation, described the night of the fire as "apocalyptic." She helped injured people as they fled from the flames, highlighting the personal impact of this tragedy on local communities.</p>
