    <h2>Protests in Iran Overwhelm Hospitals</h2>
<p>Health workers in Tehran are struggling to cope with the number of injured following clashes between security forces and demonstrators on Friday night. Medics described the situation as chaotic, with many victims arriving at hospitals severely wounded or already dead. Reports indicate that there was often not even time to administer CPR due to the volume and severity of injuries. This highlights the intense unrest and the pressure on Iran’s medical systems, with ongoing protests raising concerns about further violence and humanitarian needs.</p>
<h2>Deadly Ski Resort Fire in Switzerland</h2>
<p>A New Year's Eve fire at a bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, resulted in 40 deaths and injured 116 people. Survivors and witnesses have described the night as "apocalyptic," with a woman named Marie recounting how she helped the injured as they fled the flames from a nearby bar. The incident has prompted reflection and scrutiny in the Swiss community and government as locals search for answers and support for those affected by the tragedy.</p>
<h2>US and Greenland Tensions</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump stated that the United States needs to "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from taking control. He said this could happen "the easy way" or "the hard way," referring to potential acquisition methods. However, Denmark, which oversees Greenland, has firmly rejected the idea, stating that Greenland is not for sale. This underscores ongoing strategic interest in the Arctic region and complex international relations involving Greenland’s status.</p>
<h2>Minneapolis Shooting Video Released</h2>
<p>A video has surfaced showing the moments just before gunfire erupted on a street in Minneapolis. The recording was taken by an ICE agent who opened fire during the incident. Details beyond the footage’s release remain limited, but the clip adds to the public discussion about use-of-force incidents involving law enforcement agencies.</p>
<h2>Philippines Landfill Collapse Search Continues</h2>
<p>Rescue teams in the central Philippines are racing to find dozens of people missing after a massive landslide at a landfill site. The collapse occurred when a mountain of rubbish gave way, burying parts of the area beneath debris. Efforts are ongoing to locate survivors and recover victims as officials assess the scale of the disaster and the risks involved in landfill management.</p>
<h2>Cultural Connections: US Celebrities Gain Guinea Citizenship</h2>
<p>US actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have recently become citizens of Guinea following DNA testing that linked their heritage to the African nation. They join other American celebrities who have taken similar steps to reconnect with their ancestral roots by acquiring citizenship in Guinea. This trend reflects a growing interest in personal and cultural identity among public figures.</p>
