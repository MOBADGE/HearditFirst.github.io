    <h2>Middle East Unrest and Medical Crisis</h2>
<p>In Tehran, Iran, hospitals were overwhelmed on Friday night as protests escalated into violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Health workers reported so many injured people arriving so quickly that there was "no time for CPR" in many cases. The scale of casualties strained medical resources and highlighted the mounting tensions in the capital. This situation underlines the urgent human cost of the unrest, and the challenging conditions healthcare providers face in responding to continuing demonstrations.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Tensions Over Greenland</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump stated that the United States needs to "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from gaining influence over the island. He mentioned the US would acquire it either “the easy way” or “the hard way.” However, Denmark, which governs Greenland, firmly denies any intention to sell the territory. Meanwhile, Greenlanders are increasingly concerned about their future and are seeking greater autonomy both from Denmark and on the international stage. This geopolitical dispute reflects rising global competition in the Arctic region, where Greenland’s strategic position and natural resources are highly valued.</p>
<h2>Tragic Landfill Collapse in the Philippines</h2>
<p>Rescue teams are urgently searching for dozens of people missing after a landslide at a landfill site in the central Philippines. The collapse occurred when a large mountain of rubbish gave way, burying homes and trapping residents. The situation remains critical as rescuers continue their efforts to find survivors amid unstable conditions. This disaster highlights the risks faced by communities living near or working in poorly managed waste sites in developing areas.</p>
<h2>Deadly Fire in Swiss Ski Resort</h2>
<p>The Swiss ski resort town of Crans-Montana is mourning after a New Year’s Eve fire at a bar killed 40 people and injured 116. Survivors have described the scene as “apocalyptic,” with many fleeing from the burning building. A woman named Marie, who was in a nearby bar, helped the injured and witnessed the chaos firsthand. The tragedy has prompted widespread reflection across Switzerland about fire safety and emergency preparedness in public venues.</p>
<h2>Cultural Moment: Rare Superman Comic Sells for $15 Million</h2>
<p>A rare first edition of Action Comics No 1, which introduced the superhero Superman and is considered one of the most valuable comic books, sold for $15 million. This copy was once stolen from actor Nicolas Cage. Fewer than 100 copies are believed to exist, making this sale a notable event in the collectibles market and popular culture. The high price underscores continuing strong interest in comic book memorabilia.</p>
<h2>US Celebrities Reconnect With African Heritage</h2>
<p>US actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after undergoing DNA testing tracing their roots to the country. Their decision follows a growing trend among African American celebrities who are exploring their heritage and formalizing ties with African nations through citizenship. This reflects a broader cultural movement emphasizing identity and ancestral connections.</p>
