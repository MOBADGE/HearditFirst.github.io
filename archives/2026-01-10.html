    <h2>Protests and Violence in Iran and the US</h2>
<p>Iranian hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties following a crackdown on protesters. Hundreds are believed to have been killed or injured by security forces amid ongoing unrest. In one hospital alone, more than 70 bodies were brought in, with medics describing the situation as chaotic and without even time for CPR on many victims. This suggests a severe escalation in violence and raises concerns about the humanitarian impact in Iran.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, protests continue across the United States, particularly in Minneapolis, following the death of Renee Good. Demonstrations have led to dozens of arrests and at least one police officer injured. The unrest shows the ongoing tensions in US cities around issues of policing and justice.</p>
<h2>US Military Action in Syria</h2>
<p>The US military launched large-scale strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria over the weekend. These orders came directly from US President Donald Trump and were announced by the US Central Command. The strikes represent a continuation of US efforts to combat ISIS in the region, although specific outcomes of the attacks have not yet been detailed.</p>
<h2>Disaster Response in the Philippines</h2>
<p>Rescue teams are urgently searching for dozens of people missing after a landfill landslide in the central Philippines. A mountain of rubbish at the site collapsed, causing a deadly disaster. The incident highlights ongoing risks associated with landfill management and environmental hazards in the region.</p>
<h2>Controversy Over Hospital Care in Lagos</h2>
<p>The family of author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has accused a hospital in Lagos of medical negligence following the death of her 21-month-old son. The hospital has denied any wrongdoing. This dispute points to concerns about healthcare quality and accountability in Nigerian medical facilities.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Political Developments</h2>
<p>In a cultural highlight, a rare first edition of Action Comics No. 1—famous for introducing Superman—has sold for $15 million. Fewer than 100 copies of this comic are thought to exist, making it a significant collectible.</p>
<p>On the political front, US President Donald Trump has sought $100 billion for developing Venezuela’s oil resources, but some oil executives have expressed caution. One executive described Venezuela as "uninvestable" due to past asset seizures. Additionally, Trump has stated that the US needs to "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from gaining influence, threatening to acquire the territory "the easy way" or "the hard way." Denmark, which governs Greenland, has emphasized that the territory is not for sale.</p>
<h2>Notable Citizenship Changes</h2>
<p>US actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after DNA testing linked them to the country. This move is part of a broader trend of African American celebrities reconnecting with their African heritage through citizenship.</p>
