    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 10, 2026</div>
    <h2>Middle East Unrest and Violence</h2>
<p>In Iran, hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties amid ongoing protests. Medics reported that more than 70 bodies were brought to a single hospital, with hundreds believed to have been killed or injured by security forces. The scale of the violence has left little time for emergency responses such as CPR, highlighting the intensity of the crackdown on protestors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Syria, the US military launched large-scale airstrikes against Islamic State group targets over the weekend. These strikes were ordered by US President Donald Trump and announced by the US Central Command. The operations represent a continued US effort to combat the Islamic State in the region.</p>
<h2>Protests and Police Incidents in the US</h2>
<p>Protests have persisted in Minneapolis and other US cities following the death of Renee Good. Dozens of people were arrested amid demonstrations, and one police officer sustained injuries. The events reflect ongoing tensions between communities and law enforcement.</p>
<p>In a related development, video footage emerged showing the moments before gunfire was opened by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis. The video provides new insight into the circumstances surrounding the shooting, which has been a focal point of recent unrest.</p>
<h2>Tragedy at Philippine Landfill</h2>
<p>A deadly landslide struck a landfill site in the central Philippines when a large mountain of rubbish collapsed. Rescue teams are currently racing to find dozens of people reported missing following the disaster. This incident underscores the hazards associated with waste management facilities in the region.</p>
<h2>Dispute Over Hospital Care in Nigeria</h2>
<p>The family of author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has accused a hospital in Lagos of negligence following the death of her 21-month-old son. The hospital has denied any medical negligence. This dispute has garnered public attention and raised questions about healthcare standards.</p>
<h2>US Geopolitical Moves and Economic Interests</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has expressed a desire for the United States to "own" Greenland, citing concerns about Russian and Chinese influence. Trump stated the US would acquire the territory "the easy way" or "the hard way," but Denmark, which governs Greenland, emphasized that the territory is not for sale.</p>
<p>In the energy sector, Trump is seeking $100 billion in investments for Venezuela’s oil industry. However, some oil executives remain cautious, with one noting that Venezuela has previously seized their assets twice. These contrasting positions highlight the complexities of doing business in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Technology News</h2>
<p>A rare copy of the first Superman comic, Action Comics No. 1, recently sold for $15 million. This comic introduced the iconic character of Superman, and fewer than 100 copies are believed to exist, making it a highly valuable collector’s item.</p>
<p>On social media, Elon Musk defended the platform X against government criticism. The UK government is urging the communications regulator Ofcom to consider strong actions against X, including a potential ban, but Musk described the criticism as an “excuse for censorship.” This ongoing dispute touches on broader themes of regulation and free speech online.</p>
