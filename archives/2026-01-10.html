    <h2>Protests and Violence in Iran and the US</h2>
<p>In Iran, medical workers report hospitals are overwhelmed following protests that led to hundreds of people being killed or injured by security forces. One hospital alone received more than 70 bodies. Medics described scenes so intense that there was not even time to perform CPR on many of the injured. The scale of violence underlines the government's harsh response to demonstrations, raising international concern about human rights and public safety.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, protests continue in Minneapolis and other cities days after the death of Renee Good. Dozens of people have been arrested during demonstrations, with reports of at least one police officer injured. The situation reflects ongoing tensions around law enforcement and public response related to the incident.</p>
<h2>Philippines Landfill Collapse Rescue Efforts</h2>
<p>Rescue teams are urgently searching for dozens of people missing after a massive landslide at a landfill site in the central Philippines. The collapse occurred when a large mountain of rubbish gave way, causing widespread destruction and trapping individuals beneath debris. The incident has brought attention to the safety and management of landfill operations, as well as emergency preparedness in vulnerable communities.</p>
<h2>Hospital Dispute in Lagos Over Child’s Death</h2>
<p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s family has accused a hospital in Lagos of negligence following the death of her 21-month-old son. The hospital has denied these claims, stating that medical care was appropriately administered. The dispute highlights issues around healthcare quality and accountability in Nigeria, which can have significant implications for patient trust and safety in medical institutions.</p>
<h2>Rare Superman Comic Sells for $15 Million</h2>
<p>A rare first edition of the Superman comic, Action Comics No. 1, has sold for $15 million. This comic is highly sought after because it marks the debut of the iconic superhero and fewer than 100 copies are believed to exist. The sale emphasizes the growing value of vintage comics and collectibles in the auction market, attracting interest from collectors and investors alike.</p>
<h2>US Discussions on Greenland and Venezuela Oil Investments</h2>
<p>In the US, President Donald Trump has expressed a desire for the country to "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from gaining influence there. He suggested this could happen "the easy way" or "the hard way," but Denmark stressed that Greenland is not for sale. This exchange highlights geopolitical tensions over strategic territories.</p>
<p>Regarding Venezuela, Trump also promoted a $100 billion oil investment plan for the country. However, oil industry leaders remain cautious, with some executives noting that Venezuela has previously seized their assets, labeling the country as "uninvestable." These developments underline the challenges of engaging economically with Venezuela amid political and financial risks.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media Regulation</h2>
<p>Controversy surrounds the social media platform X, with its owner Elon Musk saying that criticism of the site is being used as an "excuse for censorship." Meanwhile, the UK government is urging the communications regulator Ofcom to consider using its full powers, including a potential ban of X. The situation raises questions about content moderation, free speech, and regulatory authority over digital platforms.</p>
