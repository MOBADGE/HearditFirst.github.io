    <h2>Protests and Crackdown in Iran</h2>
<p>Hospitals in Iran are overwhelmed as protests continue across the country, according to reports from medics. There are signs that authorities are intensifying their crackdown on demonstrators, reflecting growing tensions. The increasing pressure on medical facilities highlights the scale and seriousness of the unrest. The situation remains fluid, and the response from authorities may lead to further strain on healthcare and public services.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Tensions Over Greenland</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has reignited discussion about Greenland by insisting that the US needs to "own" the island to prevent Russia and China from gaining influence there. He suggested that America would acquire Greenland either "the easy way" or "the hard way." However, Denmark, which currently oversees Greenland, has firmly stated that the territory is not for sale. Meanwhile, Greenlanders themselves are expressing concerns about their future and are calling for more autonomy, wanting a larger role both in their relationship with Denmark and on the global stage. This geopolitical tension highlights the strategic importance of Greenland amidst broader international competition.</p>
<h2>Minneapolis Shooting Captured on Video</h2>
<p>A new video has emerged showing the moments leading up to a shooting in Minneapolis, involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who opened fire on a city street. The footage provides additional context to an incident that has drawn public attention and could influence ongoing discussions about law enforcement conduct and oversight. Details about the incident and its repercussions are still developing.</p>
<h2>Deadly Landfill Collapse in the Philippines</h2>
<p>Rescue teams in the central Philippines are racing to find dozens of people missing after a deadly landslide at a landfill site, where a large mountain of rubbish collapsed. The disaster has prompted urgent search and rescue operations as concerns grow for those still unaccounted for. This incident underscores the dangers associated with large waste sites and the importance of safety measures to prevent similar events.</p>
<h2>Reflections on Swiss Ski Resort Fire Tragedy</h2>
<p>The Swiss community is mourning after a New Year's Eve fire at a bar in Crans-Montana claimed 40 lives and injured 116. Survivors and locals are describing the night as "apocalyptic," with harrowing accounts from people like Marie, who was in a nearby bar and helped those fleeing the fire. The tragedy has prompted national soul-searching and calls for government action to prevent future disasters at public venues. As the community continues to grieve, investigations and memorial events are ongoing.</p>
<h2>Cultural Heritage and Identity</h2>
<p>American actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after DNA testing connected them to the country. They join a growing number of US celebrities choosing to reconnect with their African roots by acquiring citizenship. This trend reflects a broader interest in exploring heritage and creating cross-cultural ties.</p>
