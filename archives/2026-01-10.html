    <h2>Protests in Iran Overwhelm Hospitals</h2>
<p>Medical workers in Iran are facing a crisis as hospitals become overwhelmed with injured and dead protesters.

The situation highlights ongoing unrest and a severe strain on medical resources. The scale of the crisis points to rising tensions and the urgent need for humanitarian support.</p>
<h2>Controversy Over Greenland Ownership</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has suggested that the United States should "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from gaining influence there. He indicated that the US would acquire the territory either "the easy way" or "the hard way." However, Denmark, which currently governs Greenland, has firmly rejected the idea that Greenland is for sale. This dispute underlines the strategic importance of Greenland amid global power competition.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Swiss Ski Resort</h2>
<p>In Crans-Montana, Switzerland, a devastating fire at a ski resort bar on New Year's Eve resulted in 40 deaths and 116 injuries. Survivors described the event as "apocalyptic," with scenes of chaos as people fled the blaze. A woman named Marie recounted helping the injured at a nearby bar as they escaped the flames. The community and government are now reflecting on the tragedy and the factors that led to the disaster.</p>
<h2>Philippines Landfill Collapse</h2>

<h2>Cultural and Celebrity News</h2>
<p>In the world of collectibles, a rare first edition of Action Comics No. 1, which introduced Superman, was sold for $15 million. This comic is one of fewer than 100 known copies and was once stolen from actor Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after tracing their ancestry through DNA tests. They join a growing number of American celebrities reconnecting with their African roots through citizenship applications.</p>
<h2>Business Caution Over Venezuela Oil</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has requested $100 billion for oil investments in Venezuela. However, oil industry executives remain cautious due to past asset seizures in the country. One executive described Venezuela as "uninvestable," reflecting widespread concerns about the risks of doing business there.</p>
<h2>Social Media Debate in the UK</h2>
<p>Elon Musk criticized government pushback against the social media platform X, calling public outcry an "excuse for censorship."
