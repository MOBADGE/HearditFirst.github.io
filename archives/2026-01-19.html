    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 19, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The US president made headlines by linking his demands over Greenland to not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. After being overlooked for the prize, he said he no longer feels obligated to prioritize peace, signaling a potential shift in his approach to international diplomacy. This stance has drawn attention in Europe, where some pro-Russian media outlets have expressed approval of his interest in purchasing Greenland. The situation reveals tensions in transatlantic relations and reflects broader geopolitical rivalries. It remains to be seen how this stance will affect US-Europe ties and global diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Transportation Tragedies</h2>
<p>Spain experienced its worst rail disaster in over ten years when two high-speed trains collided near Córdoba, killing at least 39 people. Around 400 passengers were on board, and survivors described the crash scene as "absolutely terrifying." Emergency services are continuing rescue and recovery operations amid investigations into the cause of the collision. This tragic event highlights ongoing challenges in railway safety and infrastructure maintenance in Spain and Europe more broadly.</p>
<h2>Public Safety Incidents</h2>
<p>South Africa is mourning the deaths of thirteen schoolchildren after their bus collided with a lorry. Road safety remains a critical concern in the country, which has a poor record for traffic-related fatalities. In Australia, the city of Sydney experienced its third shark attack in two days. A man was seriously injured, and two children—a 12-year-old and an 11-year-old—were also hurt in separate incidents involving sharks. These events raise awareness about public safety, both in transportation and natural environments.</p>
<h2>Crime and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>In Ghana, authorities have arrested several Nigerians suspected of managing cyber-crime networks. The arrests come amid reports that foreigners are being enticed to Ghana with promises of lucrative employment, only to become involved in illegal activities. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, lawyers representing the Moretti couple, who own bars linked to a recent deadly fire, have spoken out against what they describe as vindictiveness and circulating lies about their clients. These developments underscore ongoing challenges in tackling crime and ensuring justice.</p>
<h2>Remarks on Global Power and Law</h2>
<p>The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed concerns about the United States' approach to international law. He told the BBC that Washington seems to believe its power outweighs the importance of multilateral solutions, indicating a perception that international agreements and cooperation are less relevant to US policy. This view has implications for global governance and the future of international cooperation on key issues.</p>
