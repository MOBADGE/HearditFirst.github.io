    <h2>Spain High-Speed Train Crash</h2>
<p>A high-speed train crash near Córdoba, Spain, on Sunday evening has resulted in at least 39 deaths, marking the deadliest rail accident in the country in over a decade. More than 400 passengers were on board when two trains collided between Málaga and Madrid. Survivors have described the scene as "absolutely terrifying." Emergency services are responding as investigations into the cause of the crash continue. The tragedy has raised concerns about rail safety and the challenges of managing high-speed train networks with growing passenger numbers.</p>
<h2>Global Economic Risks Highlighted by IMF</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that global economic growth faces significant risks due to escalating trade tensions and a potential slowdown in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry boom. These factors could undermine economic stability worldwide, adding uncertainty to markets and future investments. Policymakers are being urged to manage trade relationships carefully and foster innovation to maintain momentum in global growth.</p>
<h2>UN Chief Criticizes US Approach to International Law</h2>
<p>António Guterres, speaking to the BBC, expressed concern over what he described as a "clear conviction" in Washington that power matters more than international law or multilateral cooperation. The UN chief indicated this attitude challenges the effectiveness of global governance and multilateral institutions designed to address worldwide issues collaboratively. This stance could influence international diplomacy and future responses to global crises.</p>
<h2>Japan Prime Minister Calls Snap Election</h2>
<p>Sanae Takaichi, who became Japan’s Prime Minister last October, has announced a snap election to be held soon. She hopes the election will provide her government with a stronger mandate to implement its policies. The decision comes less than three months into her tenure and signals an effort to consolidate political support amid domestic and international challenges.</p>
<h2>Population Decline in China</h2>
<p>China is experiencing a continued decline in its population, with the birth rate hitting a record low. Despite government efforts to encourage marriage and childbirth among young people, the population shrinkage is ongoing. This demographic trend poses challenges for the country’s economic growth and social services, prompting policymakers to explore new strategies to address the declining population.</p>
<h2>Shark Attacks Near Sydney</h2>
<p>In Sydney, Australia, a 12-year-old boy was seriously injured in a shark attack while jumping off a rock ledge in Sydney Harbour. This marks the third shark attack in the area within two days, heightening concern among residents and visitors. Authorities are assessing safety measures and monitoring the waters to prevent further incidents.</p>
