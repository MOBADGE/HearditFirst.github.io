    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 19, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Incidents and Accidents</h2>
<p>Spain experienced its worst rail disaster in over ten years when two high-speed trains collided near Córdoba. At least 39 people were killed, and more than 400 passengers were on board. Survivors described the crash as "absolutely terrifying," highlighting the chaotic and frightening moments during the accident.</p>
<p>In South Africa, thirteen schoolchildren died after their bus collided with a lorry. This tragic event adds to ongoing concerns about the country's road safety record, which remains poor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sydney faced a series of shark attacks over two days. One man was seriously injured, a 12-year-old was hurt in a separate incident, and an 11-year-old encountered a shark bite on his surfboard, requiring assistance.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Japan, Sanae Takaichi called a snap election just three months after taking office as prime minister. She aims to strengthen her mandate through the upcoming vote, which could shape the country's political landscape in the near term.</p>
<h2>U.S. and International Relations</h2>
<p>The United States president tied his demands related to Greenland to his disappointment over not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. He indicated he no longer feels obligated to prioritize peace in his actions.</p>
<p>Separately, António Guterres, the United Nations chief, criticized the U.S. for prioritizing its own power over international law and multilateral solutions. He said Washington sees multilateral efforts as irrelevant, reflecting deep tensions in global diplomatic approaches.</p>
<h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a warning about risks to global economic growth. Key concerns include increasing trade tensions between countries and a slowdown or reversal in the rapid advances related to artificial intelligence. These challenges could affect markets and economies worldwide in the near future.</p>
<h2>Crime in West Africa</h2>
<p>Authorities in Ghana arrested several Nigerians accused of operating cyber-crime networks. The incidents highlight a worrying pattern where foreigners are lured to Ghana with promises of lucrative work, only to be implicated in criminal activities. This crackdown aims to address cybercrime concerns in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal Responses to Tragedy in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Following a deadly fire in Switzerland, lawyers representing the owners of the bar involved issued a public statement. They condemned what they called "vindictiveness" and false information circulating about their clients. This marks the first public response from the owners since the incident.</p>
