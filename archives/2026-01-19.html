    <h2>Spain High-Speed Train Crash</h2>
<p>At least 39 people have died in Spain's worst rail disaster in over ten years. Two high-speed trains collided and derailed near Córdoba, with more than 400 passengers on board at the time. Survivors described the scene as "absolutely terrifying," highlighting the fear and confusion during the accident. Rescue efforts are ongoing, and authorities are investigating the causes of the crash. This tragedy has raised questions about rail safety and emergency response preparedness in Spain.</p>
<h2>Global Economic Concerns</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that global economic growth faces significant risks. Trade tensions between countries remain a major concern, alongside a slowdown in the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence technology. These factors could potentially dampen economic recovery worldwide, prompting calls for cooperation and stable trade policies to sustain growth. Policymakers will need to manage these challenges carefully to avoid further economic uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Japan and US-Denmark Tensions</h2>
<p>In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has called a snap election just three months after taking office in October. She aims to secure a stronger mandate through the upcoming vote, which could impact the country's political direction going forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions between the United States and Denmark have escalated over Greenland. US President Donald Trump threatened new taxes on eight US allies from February if they oppose his proposed bid for the autonomous Danish territory. In response, the Danish Prime Minister said Europe would not be "blackmailed," signaling strong opposition to Trump's stance.</p>
<h2>UN Chief on US and International Law</h2>
<p>António Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, expressed concern that the United States places greater value on its own power than on respecting international law. He said Washington shows a "clear conviction" that multilateral solutions are irrelevant, a perspective that could undermine global governance and cooperation on key issues.</p>
<h2>Population Trends in China</h2>
<p>China's birth rate has fallen to a record low as the country's population continues to shrink. Despite efforts by Beijing to encourage marriage and childbirth among young people, the demographic decline persists. This trend poses long-term challenges for China's economic and social systems, including workforce shortages and increased pressure on elderly care.</p>
<h2>Mozambique Floods and Regional Response</h2>
<p>Severe flooding in Mozambique has led to a search for a politician swept away by the floodwaters. The situation has prompted Mozambique's President Daniel Chapo to cancel a scheduled trip to the Davos forum. A South African team is assisting in the search, illustrating regional cooperation during this emergency. The floods have caused widespread disruption and highlight the vulnerability of the region to extreme weather events.</p>
