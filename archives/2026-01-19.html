    <h2>Spain’s Deadly High-Speed Train Crash</h2>
<p>At least 39 people have died following a high-speed train derailment near Córdoba, Spain. Over 400 passengers were on board the trains involved, making this the country’s worst rail disaster in more than a decade. Local officials have confirmed the death toll, and emergency services continue to respond to the incident. The crash raises concerns about railway safety standards and the effectiveness of emergency protocols for handling accidents with large numbers of travelers. Authorities will likely investigate the causes and work on improving safety measures to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<h2>Rising Global Economic Risks Highlighted by IMF</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Fund has issued a warning about risks to global economic growth. Among the primary concerns are escalating trade tensions between countries and a sudden reversal in the artificial intelligence boom. These factors could slow economic expansion worldwide and affect markets and jobs. Policymakers and businesses might have to adapt strategies to mitigate these risks. The alert underscores the need for cooperation among nations to sustain a stable global economy amid political and technological uncertainties.</p>
<h2>US and International Law: UN Chief’s Comments</h2>
<p>António Guterres, speaking to the BBC, criticized the United States for what he described as a belief that its power outweighs international law. He said Washington holds a "clear conviction" that multilateral solutions are irrelevant, suggesting a unilateral approach to global issues. This stance may challenge international cooperation efforts and affect diplomatic relationships. The comments come amid increasing debates about the role of international institutions and the balance of power in global governance.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Japan and Denmark</h2>
<p>In Japan, Sanae Takaichi has called a snap election just three months after taking office as prime minister. She aims to secure a stronger mandate from voters to push through her agenda. The election will be closely watched for its implications on Japan’s political stability and policy direction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Denmark’s prime minister firmly stated that “Europe won’t be blackmailed” following threats from former US President Donald Trump. Trump warned he would impose new taxes on eight US allies in February if they oppose his proposed purchase of Greenland, a Danish autonomous territory. This dispute highlights tensions between the US and its European allies and raises questions about international diplomacy and economic relations.</p>
<h2>China’s Population Decline Continues</h2>
<p>China has reported a record low birth rate as its population continues to shrink. Despite government efforts to encourage young people to marry and have children, the downward trend persists. This demographic shift could have long-term social and economic implications for the country, including potential labor shortages and increased pressure on social support systems. Policymakers may need to consider additional measures to address these challenges.</p>
<h2>Sports and Local News: Senegal’s Afcon Victory and Shark Attacks in Sydney</h2>
<p>Senegal recently won the Africa Cup of Nations, defeating Morocco. However, the final match was marred by chaos when Senegal temporarily refused to play, sparking criticism and describing the situation as “shameful.” The episode cast a shadow over the team’s sporting triumph.</p>
<p>In Sydney, Australia, a 12-year-old boy was seriously injured in the third shark attack within two days. The child was mauled while jumping off a rock ledge in Sydney Harbour. The incidents have raised concerns about public safety in coastal areas and may prompt local authorities to increase warnings and preventive measures.</p>
