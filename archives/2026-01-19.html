    <h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has confirmed that he will "100%" enforce tariffs on Greenland, underscoring his intent to follow through on previously stated trade measures. This announcement has raised tensions with the European Union, whose foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, responded by saying the bloc does not want a conflict but will firmly protect its interests. The dispute highlights ongoing friction over trade policies and territorial concerns in the Arctic region. Meanwhile, Russia appears to be capitalizing on the situation, with pro-Russian media praising Trump’s interest in Greenland, suggesting it reflects broader geopolitical dynamics.</p>
<h2>Spain's Deadly Train Crash</h2>
<p>Spain is mourning after its worst rail disaster in over ten years. At least 40 people died when two high-speed trains collided near the city of Córdoba, with over 400 passengers on board at the time. The cause of the collision remains unknown, but authorities have launched an investigation. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has declared three days of national mourning and vowed to find the cause of the crash. The tragedy raises serious questions about rail safety and may prompt calls for improved infrastructure or oversight.</p>
<h2>Syrian Ceasefire and Regional Control</h2>
<p>An agreement has been reached between the Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which will place an autonomous region in north-eastern Syria under state control. Despite this ceasefire deal, clashes have still been reported, indicating local tensions remain high. The agreement represents a significant moment in efforts to stabilize the region and reshape authority in an area affected by years of conflict, though its success will depend on maintaining peace on the ground.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accident in South Africa</h2>
<p>A fatal collision in South Africa has resulted in the deaths of thirteen schoolchildren after a bus and lorry crashed. This incident is the latest in a country with a challenging road safety record. The accident underscores ongoing concerns about transportation safety for children and may renew calls for enhanced road safety measures to prevent such tragedies.</p>
<h2>Notable Death in Fashion</h2>
<p>The world of fashion is mourning the loss of Valentino, a renowned Italian designer who died at 93. He was celebrated as a significant figure in 20th-century fashion, with his creations worn by many celebrities including Elizabeth Taylor, Julia Roberts, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Valentino’s death marks the passing of an iconic name that shaped global fashion trends for decades.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>In Sydney, Australia, there have been three shark attacks in two days, with a man seriously injured in the latest incident. Among the previous cases, a 12-year-old was hurt, and an 11-year-old’s surfboard was bitten. These events have heightened concerns about beach safety in the area.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, lawyers representing the Moretti couple, owners of a bar involved in a recent deadly fire, have spoken out to condemn what they call "vindictiveness" and "lies" circulating about their clients, marking their first public statement since the tragedy.</p>
