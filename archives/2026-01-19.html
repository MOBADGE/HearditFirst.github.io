    <h2>Major Train Crash in Spain</h2>
<p>At least 39 people have died in a high-speed train derailment near the city of Córdoba, Spain. The crash involved trains carrying more than 400 passengers and is being described by local officials as the country’s worst rail disaster in over ten years. Emergency services responded to the scene to assist survivors and manage the aftermath. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about railway safety and infrastructure management in Spain.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Japan and Europe</h2>
<p>In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has called for a snap election three months after assuming office in October. She hopes the election will provide her with a stronger political mandate as she leads the country forward.</p>
<p>In Europe, tensions have escalated following comments by Donald Trump about taxing US allies in response to opposition over his proposed takeover of Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. The Danish Prime Minister responded firmly, stating that Europe will not be blackmailed. This exchange reflects ongoing diplomatic strains between the US and its European partners regarding territorial and economic issues.</p>
<h2>Global Population and Environmental Challenges</h2>
<p>China is facing a continuing population decline as its birth rate has dropped to a record low despite government efforts to encourage marriage and childbirth among young people. This demographic trend poses long-term economic and social challenges for Beijing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chile has declared a state of catastrophe due to wildfires in the Ñuble and Biobío regions, which have resulted in at least 18 deaths. The country’s president warned that the casualty numbers may rise as firefighters battle the blazes. This announcement underscores the growing impact of climate-related disasters globally.</p>
<h2>Industrial Accidents in Asia</h2>
<p>A factory explosion in China caused noticeable tremors and large smoke plumes, killing two people and injuring 84. The blast has brought renewed scrutiny to industrial safety standards in affected areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, a massive fire in Karachi, Pakistan, at the Gul Plaza shopping mall resulted in 14 deaths and dozens of people missing after burning for over 24 hours before being extinguished. Rescue teams continue to search for survivors amid damaged structures, highlighting ongoing risks in urban fire safety.</p>
<h2>Sports and Social Unrest in Africa</h2>
<p>Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations by defeating Morocco, but the final was marked by controversy when Senegal temporarily refused to continue play.
