    <div class="date">January 19, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>The United States has reaffirmed its intention to impose tariffs on imports from Greenland, with Donald Trump stating he will "100%" follow through on the threat. This move has prompted a response from the European Union, whose foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stressed that while the EU does not want to escalate tensions, it will defend its interests firmly. The situation reflects continuing trade and diplomatic tensions between the US and European partners. Meanwhile, Russia, through its state-influenced media, has expressed approval of Trump's interest in Greenland, portraying the move as a disruption to European unity.</p>
<h2>Transport Disaster in Spain</h2>
<p>Spain is mourning a devastating high-speed train crash near Córdoba that left at least 39 people dead and injured many others. The collision involved more than 400 passengers and is considered the worst rail disaster in the country in over ten years. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced three days of national mourning and pledged a thorough investigation into the cause of the accident, which remains unclear. Officials continue working to understand what led to the derailment as families and the nation mourn those lost.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accident in South Africa</h2>
<p>A serious road accident in South Africa has resulted in the deaths of thirteen schoolchildren after their bus collided with a lorry. This tragic event adds to ongoing concerns about the country's road safety record, which has been described as poor. The incident highlights the urgent need for improvements in road safety measures to protect vulnerable passengers, especially children.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Ceasefire in Syria</h2>
<p>Despite a new agreement aiming to establish a ceasefire and bring an autonomous region under state control in north-eastern Syria, clashes have been reported between Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The ceasefire deal marks an important development towards stabilizing the region, but the recent violence underscores the fragility of the agreement and the challenges ahead for lasting peace.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>The world of fashion has lost an iconic figure with the death of Valentino, a celebrated Italian designer known for dressing celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor and Julia Roberts. His legacy marks a significant chapter in 20th-century fashion.</p>
<p>In Sydney, there have been three shark-related incidents in two days, including a serious injury to a man. These reports raise local concerns about beach safety.</p>
<p>Finally, lawyers for the owners of a Swiss bar involved in a deadly fire have publicly denounced what they call "vindictiveness" and misinformation surrounding their clients, emphasizing the complexities and sensitivities involved in such investigations.</p>
