    <h2>Global Trade Tensions over Greenland</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has said he is "100%" committed to imposing tariffs on Greenland, escalating tensions between the US and the European Union. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, stated that while the bloc does not want to provoke a conflict, it will defend its interests amid Trump's continued interest in purchasing Greenland. This dispute highlights ongoing geopolitical competition in the Arctic region and could lead to broader trade disagreements between the US and Europe.</p>
<h2>Rail Disasters in Spain and South Africa</h2>
<p>Spain is mourning after a deadly high-speed train collision in the southern part of the country killed at least 40 people. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced three days of national mourning and ordered a full investigation into the cause of the crash. It is the worst rail disaster in Spain in over a decade, though officials have not yet determined what caused the derailment.</p>
<p>Separately, in South Africa, a tragic road accident occurred when a bus collided with a lorry, resulting in the deaths of 13 schoolchildren. This incident adds to the country’s ongoing difficulties with road safety, where fatal traffic collisions remain common. Both events have drawn attention to transportation safety concerns in their respective regions.</p>
<h2>Syria’s New Ceasefire Agreement</h2>
<p>A ceasefire has been agreed between the Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). This agreement will place an autonomous region in north-east Syria under state control. Despite the ceasefire, some clashes have still been reported, suggesting the situation remains fragile. The deal marks a significant step toward consolidating government authority, but vigilance is needed to maintain peace.</p>
<h2>China’s Declining Birth Rate</h2>
<p>China’s birth rate has reached a record low, underscoring continued population decline concerns. Despite government efforts to motivate young people to marry and have children, the trend has not reversed. This demographic shift poses long-term challenges for China’s economy and social services, and officials may need to explore new policies to stimulate population growth.</p>
<h2>Notable Death in Fashion</h2>
<p>Italian fashion designer Valentino has died at the age of 93. He was a major figure in 20th-century fashion, known for his creations worn by celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Julia Roberts, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Valentino’s passing marks the end of an era for a designer whose influence extended across several decades and continents.</p>
