    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Tensions have risen after Donald Trump said he will "100%" implement tariffs on products from Greenland. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, responded by saying the EU does not want to pick a fight but will firmly protect its interests. This development follows Trump's expressed interest in buying Greenland, a move that has been praised by pro-Russian media. The situation highlights ongoing geopolitical sensitivities involving the Arctic region and could impact trade and diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>Spain's Deadly Train Crash</h2>
<p>Spain is mourning following a high-speed train crash near Córdoba that killed at least 39 people and seriously injured many others. Over 400 passengers were on board at the time of the accident, making it the worst rail disaster in Spain in over a decade. The cause of the crash remains unclear, but authorities have launched an official investigation. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez declared three days of mourning and pledged to uncover the cause to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<h2>Syria Ceasefire Agreement and Clashes</h2>
<p>Despite a new ceasefire agreement between the Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), clashes have still been reported. The agreement aims to bring the semi-autonomous region in north-east Syria back under the control of the central government. However, this transition appears to be facing difficulties as fighting continues in the area, indicating that the situation remains unstable.</p>
<h2>Tragic Bus Collision in South Africa</h2>
<p>A bus carrying schoolchildren collided with a lorry in South Africa, resulting in the deaths of 13 children. The incident adds to concerns about road safety in the country, where traffic accidents are unfortunately common and often fatal. Authorities have not provided further details but the tragedy underscores ongoing challenges in improving road conditions and driver safety.</p>
<h2>Death of Valentino</h2>
<p>Valentino, a renowned Italian fashion designer and one of the giants of 20th-century fashion, has died at the age of 93. His work was widely admired and embraced by celebrities including Elizabeth Taylor, Julia Roberts, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Valentino's influence on the fashion world has been significant, leaving behind a lasting legacy in design and style.</p>
<h2>Other News Highlights</h2>
<p>In Sydney, three shark attacks were reported in just two days, including one serious injury to a man. Among the incidents, two children were also injured or involved after encounters with sharks while surfing. Meanwhile, lawyers representing the Moretti couple, owners of a Swiss bar affected by a recent deadly fire, issued a public statement condemning what they described as "vindictiveness" and false information circulating about their clients.</p>
