    <div class="date">January 19, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Tensions have escalated after Donald Trump reiterated his commitment to impose tariffs on goods from Greenland, despite opposition from the European Union. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc does not want to provoke conflict but will firmly defend its interests. Meanwhile, Russian media have reacted positively to Trump's interest in Greenland, interpreting it as a strategic move that challenges Europe's position.</p>
<p>In Syria, the government and Kurdish-led forces known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have agreed on a ceasefire. This deal is expected to bring an autonomous region in the northeast under state control. However, clashes have still been reported despite the agreement, showing that stability remains fragile.</p>
<h2>Transportation Tragedies</h2>
<p>Spain is mourning after its worst rail accident in more than ten years. A high-speed train derailed near Córdoba, resulting in at least 40 deaths and injuring many others. Over 400 passengers were onboard at the time. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced three days of mourning and promised a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the crash, which remains unclear.</p>
<p>In South Africa, a bus collided with a lorry, killing thirteen schoolchildren. This fatal accident highlights ongoing concerns about road safety in the country, where serious collisions are frequent.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Incidents</h2>
<p>Sydney has seen a series of shark attacks over the past two days, with three separate incidents resulting in injuries. Among those harmed were a 12-year-old and an 11-year-old, the latter requiring assistance after his surfboard was bitten. One man was seriously injured, marking a concerning trend in local beach safety.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, lawyers representing the Moretti couple, owners of a bar involved in a recent deadly fire, have spoken out against what they describe as "vindictiveness." They stated that false information about their clients has been circulating since the incident.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>The world of fashion has lost a major figure with the death of Valentino, an Italian designer who was 93 years old. Known for his elegant designs worn by celebrities including Elizabeth Taylor, Julia Roberts, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Valentino was considered one of the giants of 20th-century fashion.</p>
