    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The US president linked his recent demands to purchase Greenland with his frustration over not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. He said that, after being passed over for the award, he no longer feels obligated to focus solely on peace. This statement came in a message to Norway’s leader, which could affect ongoing diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, Russia has expressed approval of the US interest in Greenland, with pro-Russian media praising the effort. Analysts note that Russia views the situation as a sign of discord within Europe, which it frames as "at a total loss" over the Greenland issue.</p>

The incident has prompted concerns about railway safety standards in the country and the need for improved safety measures.</p>

<h2>Legal and Social Issues in Switzerland</h2>
