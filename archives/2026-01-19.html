    <h2>Major Train Crash in Spain</h2>
<p>A high-speed train crash near Córdoba, Spain, has killed at least 39 people. Over 400 passengers were on board when two trains collided between Málaga and Madrid on Sunday evening. This is the worst rail accident in Spain in more than ten years. Survivors described the collision as "absolutely terrifying" amid the chaos. Rescue efforts continue as authorities investigate the cause of the derailment.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Japan and the US</h2>
<p>In Japan, Sanae Takaichi, who became prime minister last October, has called a snap election just three months into her term. She aims to secure a stronger mandate in the vote, which may reshape the country’s political landscape.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump linked his failure to receive the Nobel Peace Prize to a change in his approach to international peace initiatives. He stated that he no longer feels obliged to prioritize peace in his policies. This remark highlights ongoing tensions in US foreign policy.</p>
<h2>International Concerns on Multilateralism</h2>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres criticized the United States for its stance on international law and multilateral solutions. He said that Washington holds a "clear conviction" that global cooperation is less relevant, signaling challenges for international diplomacy and the UN's work in addressing global issues collaboratively.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accidents in Africa</h2>
<p>South Africa experienced another tragic road accident when a bus carrying schoolchildren collided with a lorry, killing thirteen children. The incident adds to the country’s ongoing struggles with road safety.</p>
<p>In neighboring Mozambique, severe flooding has led to a search operation for a politician believed to have been swept away. The situation prompted Mozambique’s President Daniel Chapo to cancel a planned trip to Davos to focus on managing the flood crisis.</p>
<h2>China’s Demographic Challenges</h2>
<p>China’s birth rate has fallen to a record low as its population continues to shrink. Despite government efforts to encourage marriage and childbearing among young people, these measures have yet to reverse the decline. This demographic trend raises concerns about the future workforce and economic growth.</p>
<h2>Sports and Social Issues in Senegal</h2>
<p>Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations by defeating Morocco. However, the victory was accompanied by controversy as Senegal’s team temporarily refused to play during the final. The incident drew criticism, with commentators describing the chaos as "shameful" and a "terrible look," overshadowing their achievement.</p>
