    <h2>Mass Shooting in Tumbler Ridge</h2>
<p>Authorities have identified an 18-year-old suspect in a deadly shooting incident in Tumbler Ridge. The attack at a local school resulted in six deaths and injured at least 25 people. Additionally, two other bodies were found at a nearby home, bringing the total fatalities related to the event to eight. The close-knit community is deeply affected, with residents expressing fear and uncertainty as they process the tragedy.</p>
<h2>Cyclone Devastates Madagascar</h2>
<p>A powerful cyclone has swept through a port region in Madagascar, killing at least 31 people. The storm caused widespread destruction, making roads impassable and uprooting trees. Power lines have been downed, and about 90% of roofs in the affected area were damaged or destroyed. Relief efforts may be complicated by the extensive infrastructural damage.</p>
<h2>US and Israel Discuss Iran Nuclear Talks</h2>
<p>In a White House meeting, the US leader spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran. The US leader was clear that no definitive agreement was reached during their talks, underscoring that discussions are continuing amid heightened international attention.</p>
<h2>Ukrainian Family Killed in Russian Strike</h2>
<p>A Russian attack in north-eastern Ukraine resulted in the deaths of three young children—a pair of two-year-old brothers and their one-year-old sister—and their father. The pregnant mother was injured in the strike and survived. The family was found in the wreckage of their home, highlighting the continuing human toll of the conflict.</p>
<h2>Social and Political Tensions in Iran</h2>
<p>The BBC reports from Tehran indicate that while state-organized rallies celebrated Iran’s revolution, there remains significant public discontent and acts of defiance following aggressive crackdowns on protests last month. This suggests ongoing tensions within the country despite official displays of unity.</p>
<h2>Cultural Pride in Ghana</h2>
<p>In Ghana, the traditional "Fugu" attire has become a source of national pride after online discussions and banter with Zambia highlighted the outfit. The garment has been trending on social media for several days, with many Ghanaians embracing it enthusiastically as part of a cultural celebration known as "Fugu Day."</p>
