    <h2>US-Canada Bridge Dispute</h2>
<p>Tensions remain over the opening of a major US-Canada bridge as the White House has renewed its demands despite a recent “positive” phone call between Donald Trump and Mark Carney. Trump has threatened to block the bridge’s opening, signaling ongoing disagreements about border infrastructure and cross-border cooperation. The situation highlights the complex negotiations involved in US-Canada relations and may impact trade and travel between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Commerce Secretary’s Epstein Island Visit</h2>
<p>Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, has confirmed that he visited Jeffrey Epstein’s private island in 2012, contradicting earlier statements that he had ended all association with Epstein in 2005. Lutnick said the visit was for a lunch during that year. This revelation puts additional scrutiny on public officials’ past connections to Epstein, a financier whose criminal associations sparked national and international investigations.</p>
<h2>Buddhist Monks’ Peace Walk Concludes in Washington</h2>
<p>A group of nineteen Buddhist monks completed a 108-day silent walk from Texas to Washington DC, advocating for greater peace in the United States. The monks walked in a single file, drawing attention to their message through quiet presence rather than protest. The walk ended in the nation’s capital, emphasizing calls for calm and unity amid societal challenges. This peaceful demonstration serves as a reminder of nonviolent activism’s role in promoting social change.</p>
<h2>Rising Challenge of Sanctions-Busting Ships</h2>
<p>Governments are grappling with an increase in “shadow ships” that bypass international sanctions to export oil illicitly. These vessels operate covertly to evade restrictions, undermining global efforts to enforce sanctions. Authorities face difficulties in tracking and regulating these ships, raising questions about how to respond effectively. This growing problem underscores challenges in maintaining compliance with trade rules and the enforcement of international law.</p>
<h2>Acid Attack Survivor Advocates for Legal Change in India</h2>
<p>Shaheen Malik, a survivor of an acid attack, has petitioned India’s top court to recognize survivors forced to ingest acid as disabled under the country’s disability law. Her fight highlights ongoing issues around acid violence and the need for legal reforms to ensure justice and dignity for survivors. Malik’s efforts could lead to changes in policy and increased support for victims of such attacks across India.</p>
