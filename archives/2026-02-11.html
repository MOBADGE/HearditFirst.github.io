    <h2>Canada School and Community Shooting</h2>
<p>Nine people have died and 25 others were injured in shootings at a school and a home in the rural western Canadian community of Tumbler Ridge. Authorities continue to investigate the incidents, which have shocked the region. The tragic event raises concerns about safety and gun violence in small communities.</p>
<h2>US and Israel Discuss Iran Nuclear Deal</h2>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet former US President Donald Trump as talks over Iran's nuclear programme advance. Netanyahu aims to push for an agreement that not only limits Iran’s nuclear capabilities but also addresses its ballistic missile development and support for armed groups in the region. This meeting comes amid heightened international focus on Iran's activities.</p>
<h2>UK Increases Military Presence in Norway</h2>
<p>The UK is set to double its troop numbers in Norway from 1,000 to 2,000. This move is intended to counter what Britain describes as the "greatest" threat from Russia since the Cold War. The bolstering of forces signals increased military preparedness in Northern Europe amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>Updates on Social Media Regulation in India</h2>
<p>India has introduced new rules requiring social media companies to remove unlawful content within three hours of notification. Critics warn these regulations may pose significant challenges for tech platforms and could lead to increased censorship. The government aims to tighten control over online content while balancing freedom of expression concerns.</p>
<h2>Cultural Pride in Ghana</h2>
<p>Ghana has declared a national "Fugu Day" to celebrate and promote the traditional Fugu outfit after it became a topic of online mockery. The attire recently gained attention through banter between Ghanaians and Zambians on social media. The government’s move is designed to foster cultural pride and respect for Ghanaian heritage.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Australia</h2>
<p>The leader of Australia’s opposition party, Sussan Ley, faces pressure following the resignation of a key colleague. The departure has opened the door for a leadership challenge against Ley, who is noted as the first female leader of the Liberal Party. This shift could have significant implications for Australian politics ahead of upcoming elections.</p>
