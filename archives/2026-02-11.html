    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 11, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The Israeli prime minister is scheduled to meet former US President Donald Trump amid critical negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu is expected to urge Trump to support a deal that would stop Iran from enriching uranium, an issue of significant concern for regional and global security.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UK has announced it will double its troop presence in Norway from 1,000 to 2,000 personnel over the next three years. This move is intended to counter what Defence Secretary John Healey described as a Russian threat to the Arctic region, highlighting ongoing tensions in the area.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict Update</h2>
<p>Russian strikes near Kharkiv in north-eastern Ukraine have killed four people, including three toddlers and a 34-year-old man. Their bodies were recovered from the rubble of a house destroyed in the attack. This incident underscores the continued violence affecting civilians in the region.</p>
<h2>United States Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>US lawmakers have urged Prince Andrew to testify regarding documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. The call comes after the King indicated that the Royal Family is prepared to support police investigations.</p>
<p>In related news, Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, confirmed visiting Epstein’s island in 2012, contradicting earlier statements that he severed ties with Epstein in 2005. This admission has added to scrutiny surrounding individuals connected to Epstein.</p>
<p>Additionally, former President Trump has threatened to block the opening of a US-Canada bridge, despite a recent positive phone call with Canadian official Mark Carney. The White House continues to press its demands related to the project.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Cultural News</h2>
<p>India has introduced new regulations requiring social media companies to remove unlawful content within three hours. Some critics caution that these rules may pose compliance challenges for technology firms and could lead to broader censorship concerns.</p>
<p>In cultural news from Ghana, the government has declared the upcoming Wednesday as 'Fugu Day' to promote the traditional attire. This follows several days of trending discussions and friendly banter online between people from Ghana and Zambia regarding the iconic garment.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Business</h2>
<p>Pop star Britney Spears has reportedly sold the rights to her entire music catalogue to independent publisher Primary Wave. The deal, completed on December 30, is valued at around $200 million, which will impact the management and distribution of her music going forward.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement Update</h2>
<p>Police released a man who was detained in connection with the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie. The individual had been taken into custody during a traffic stop, and authorities searched his home as part of the investigation. The case remains under review.</p>
