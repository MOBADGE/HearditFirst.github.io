    <h2>Security and Investigation Updates</h2>
<p>Police have detained a person of interest in the ongoing search for Nancy Guthrie. The individual was taken into custody during a traffic stop, and authorities are now searching their home as part of the investigation. The situation remains active, and police continue to seek information about Guthrie's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, some lawmakers have called for Andrew to testify concerning files related to Jeffrey Epstein. This follows a statement from the King that the Royal Family is willing to support police inquiries. The matter relates to broader investigations involving Epstein, including testimony from various individuals connected to his activities.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Donald Trump as negotiations over Iran's nuclear program enter a critical phase. Netanyahu is expected to urge Trump to pursue an agreement that would stop Iran's uranium enrichment, a key point of concern for Israel and the international community.</p>
<p>In Europe, the UK is increasing its military presence in Norway in response to concerns about Russian activities in the Arctic. Defence Secretary John Healey announced that British troops in Norway will double from 1,000 to 2,000 over the next three years. This move is intended to strengthen NATO's posture in the region amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>In northeastern Ukraine near Kharkiv, Russian strikes have resulted in the deaths of four people, including three toddlers and a 34-year-old man. Their bodies were recovered from the rubble of a destroyed home. This incident highlights the ongoing human toll of the conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>US-Canada Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>Tensions have risen between the United States and Canada regarding the opening of a cross-border bridge. Despite what was described as a "positive" phone call between Donald Trump and Canadian official Mark Carney, the White House has reiterated demands that have led Trump to threaten blocking the bridge's opening. The dispute reflects ongoing trade and border issues between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>Pop singer Britney Spears has sold the rights to her entire music catalog to independent music publisher Primary Wave. The deal, finalized on December 30, 2025, is reported to be worth around $200 million. This sale marks a significant business move in Spears’ career, potentially affecting the management of her musical legacy.</p>
<p>Also, 19 Buddhist monks completed a 108-day Walk for Peace from Texas to Washington DC. The monks walked in silence, advocating for increased peace across the United States. Their journey drew attention to calls for harmony and non-violence in contemporary society.</p>
<h2>Economic and Policy Challenges</h2>
<p>An increasing number of "shadow ships" are reportedly engaged in circumventing sanctions, especially related to oil exports. This growing practice poses challenges for governments aiming to enforce international trade rules and sanctions effectively. Policymakers are considering strategies to address this issue but face difficulties in managing enforcement on the high seas.</p>
