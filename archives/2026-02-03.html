    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding matters related to Jeffrey Epstein. The couple had previously contested the committee’s subpoenas, arguing they were invalid. Their compliance comes ahead of a House vote that could hold them in contempt of Congress, marking a significant moment in ongoing investigations connected to Epstein.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump is seeking $1 billion in damages from Harvard University. This legal action adds to the continuing tensions between Trump and the Ivy League institution, extending a long-running feud into the courtroom.</p>
<h2>International Tensions and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high between Russia and Ukraine following a substantial assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The attack involved more than 70 missiles and 450 drones and is described as the "most powerful blow" Russia has made this year. It comes shortly after the expiration of a temporary "energy truce" over the weekend, potentially signalling a new phase of conflict escalation.</p>
<p>In diplomatic news, Iran has indicated readiness to negotiate with the United States. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian emphasized the desire for "fair and equitable" talks as the US increases its military presence in the region. This development could influence future US-Iran relations amid existing tensions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Colombian President Gustavo Petro is preparing to meet with former US President Donald Trump. The two leaders, who have had a fraught relationship marked by barbs and accusations, might be moving towards a new chapter following months of acrimony.</p>
<h2>Tech and Regulatory News</h2>
<p>Elon Musk’s social media platform X and the AI platform Grok are under intensified scrutiny from European authorities. French police recently raided X’s offices, while the United Kingdom has launched a fresh investigation into Grok. These actions highlight growing regulatory attention on Musk’s technology companies in multiple countries.</p>
<p>On a different technology front, China has become the first country to ban the use of hidden car door handles. This design, popularized by Tesla, raised safety concerns leading to the new regulations. This ban may affect automotive design trends and Tesla’s market approach in China going forward.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Legal Cases</h2>
<p>A remarkable survival story emerged from Australia, where 13-year-old Austin Applebee swam for hours to rescue his mother and siblings who were swept out to sea. Austin described his efforts as "superhuman," highlighting his determination and presence of mind during a life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>In Norway, a high-profile legal case is unfolding involving Marius Borg Høiby, son of Norway’s crown princess. He faces 38 charges, including four counts of rape, in one of the country’s most significant trials in recent years. The case has drawn considerable attention amid the royal family's prominence.</p>
<h2>Aviation Safety</h2>
<p>India’s aviation regulator has reported that no defect was found in the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 jet that was grounded by Air India. The grounding followed concerns raised by a pilot, but the investigation cleared the switch of any faults. This update may help restore confidence in the safety of the aircraft model for Indian airlines and passengers.</p>
