    <h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding questions connected to Jeffrey Epstein. The couple had previously resisted subpoenas issued by the committee, arguing that they were invalid. Their decision to comply comes as the committee faces a looming vote on whether to hold them in contempt of Congress. The testimony could provide further insight into Epstein's network and activities, though the broader implications for ongoing investigations remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>Legal Case in Norway</h2>
<p>Marius Borg Høiby, the son of Norway's crown princess, has gone on trial facing serious charges including 38 counts, among them four counts of rape. This trial is one of the most significant legal cases Norway has seen in recent years. The outcome could have considerable personal and public ramifications, both for Høiby and for the Norwegian royal family, which is watching the proceedings closely amid tense public interest.</p>
<h2>US-Colombia Relations</h2>
<p>After months of tense exchanges and mutual criticism, the leaders of Colombia and the United States are set to meet. Colombian President Gustavo Petro and former US President Donald Trump have had a fraught relationship, marked by barbs and accusations in public statements. This upcoming meeting signals a possible shift toward dialogue, although it remains uncertain whether it will ease longstanding tensions or produce concrete policy agreements.</p>
<h2>Technology and Industry</h2>
<p>Elon Musk’s space exploration company, SpaceX, announced it will take over his artificial intelligence start-up. The merger combines Musk’s ventures in space exploration and AI under one organizational umbrella. This move highlights ongoing consolidation in technology sectors and may influence competition and innovation in AI development and space technology.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China has become the first country to ban hidden car door handles, a design popularized by Tesla. This regulatory change stems from safety concerns and marks a notable shift in automotive design standards. The ban could affect future vehicle models sold in China and prompt manufacturers to rethink certain design features.</p>
<h2>Immigration and International Trade</h2>
<p>In the United States, a judge has temporarily blocked the Department of Homeland Security’s plan to end deportation protections for Haitian migrants. The judge ruled that there was insufficient factual and legal basis for lifting these protections. This decision means Haitian migrants currently protected will not face immediate deportation, though the government may seek to appeal or revise its policies.</p>
<p>On the trade front, India and the US have agreed to a long-delayed trade deal that includes reduced tariffs welcomed by Indian industry. However, experts advise caution, noting that the full details have yet to be disclosed and the impact on various sectors remains unclear. The agreement could shape economic relations between the two countries in the near future, but much depends on how it is implemented and negotiated further.</p>
<h2>Local News from Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, residents of a lagoon-area shantytown have experienced demolitions and burning of their homes. While officials deny intentions of gentrification, many locals suspect the clearing of these settlements is aimed at redeveloping the waterfront. The incident raises ongoing concerns about housing rights and urban development pressures in rapidly growing cities.</p>
