    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding their connections to Jeffrey Epstein. This decision comes after months of resistance, during which the couple argued the committee's subpoenas were invalid. Their testimonies are expected amid a looming vote that could hold them in contempt of Congress if they refused to cooperate. This marks a significant development in ongoing investigations related to Epstein.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has taken legal action against Harvard University, seeking $1 billion in damages. This lawsuit is part of a broader and ongoing dispute between Trump and the Ivy League institution. The case adds to the legal and political tensions surrounding both parties.</p>
<h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, Russian forces launched an extensive attack targeting energy infrastructure, described as the most powerful strike so far this year. The assault involved over 70 missiles and approximately 450 drones, following the expiry of a so-called "energy truce" over the weekend. This attack poses challenges for Ukraine's energy stability and intensifies the ongoing conflict in the region.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The crossing's reopening allowed a limited number of Palestinian patients to leave Gaza for medical treatment. The crossing's status remains a critical point for humanitarian access in the region.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Iran has signaled readiness to enter "fair and equitable" negotiations with the United States, according to Masoud Pezeshkian. This statement comes as the US is increasing its military presence in the region, suggesting potential shifts in diplomatic engagement amidst heightened tensions.</p>
<p>In South America, Colombian leader Gustavo Petro is preparing to meet with Donald Trump after a period marked by hostile exchanges. Despite recent efforts towards civility, their meeting occurs against a backdrop of long-standing accusations and political friction, potentially influencing bilateral relations.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Actions and Safety Measures</h2>
<p>France and the UK have escalated investigations involving Elon Musk's platforms, X and Grok. French authorities conducted raids on offices associated with X, while the UK opened a fresh inquiry into Grok. These moves indicate increasing regulatory scrutiny over these digital platforms on both sides of the English Channel.</p>
<p>Additionally, China has taken a unique step by banning cars with hidden door handles, a design initially popularized by Tesla. This marks the first national prohibition of this design, motivated by safety concerns. The decision may impact automotive design and safety standards globally.</p>
<h2>Aviation Safety Update</h2>
<p>The regulatory body overseeing Indian civil aviation found no defect in a fuel control switch related to a Boeing 787-8 jet that was grounded by Air India. The grounding occurred after a pilot reported a potential issue. This clearance suggests the aircraft may return to service following this investigation.</p>
<h2>Norway’s Royal Family in the Spotlight</h2>
<p>In Norway, a high-profile trial has begun involving Marius Borg Høiby, the son of the country's crown princess. He faces 38 charges, including four counts of rape. The case is one of the largest legal proceedings in Norway in recent years and has created a tense moment for the royal family.</p>
