    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security</h2>
<p>The US military reported shooting down an Iranian drone that was approaching an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. This incident highlights ongoing tensions in the region and the risks of military confrontations near key maritime routes. The situation remains fluid, with potential implications for US-Iran relations and regional security.</p>
<p>In Libya, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the former Libyan leader, has reportedly been killed according to Libyan media. Once considered a powerful figure in the country, his death marks a significant development in Libya's complex political landscape.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukraine experienced a harsh escalation in attacks, with more than 70 missiles and 450 drones reportedly striking the country. The assault has left thousands without heating amid freezing temperatures of -20°C. This surge in attacks follows the expiration of an energy truce over the weekend, worsening humanitarian conditions during winter.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>The House oversight committee has reached an agreement with Bill and Hillary Clinton for their participation in the House investigation related to Jeffrey Epstein. The couple will testify on separate days in late February. This development is part of a broader scrutiny of Epstein-related matters.</p>
<p>Separately, the US Department of Justice faced criticism after releasing thousands of Jeffrey Epstein documents that inadvertently included unredacted names and images of victims. As a result, many documents have been withdrawn to protect those affected.</p>
<h2>Social and Public Health Updates</h2>
<p>Spain announced plans to ban social media access for children under 16 years old. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez described the move as a step to shield children from what he called the "digital Wild West," aiming to protect young users from online harms.</p>
<p>A new scientific report highlighted that nearly 40% of cancer cases globally—totaling about seven million a year—are preventable. This finding points to a significant opportunity for public health initiatives focused on prevention strategies to save lives.</p>
<h2>Human Interest Story</h2>
<p>In Australia, a 13-year-old boy named Austin Applebee recounted how he swam for hours to save his mother and siblings after they were swept out to sea. His remarkable endurance and presence of mind helped save his family, a story that has drawn attention for its bravery and resilience.</p>
<p>Additionally, in France, a teacher is fighting for life after a stabbing attack by a 14-year-old pupil in a classroom. The teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, raising concerns over school safety.</p>
