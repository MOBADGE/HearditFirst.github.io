    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in several global hotspots today. The US military reported shooting down an Iranian drone that was approaching an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. This incident adds to growing concerns about drone activity near military vessels in strategic regions.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, a large-scale missile and drone attack hit the country following the end of a recent energy truce. Over 70 missiles and 450 drones targeted infrastructure, leading to thousands of people losing heating as temperatures dropped to -20C. The attack highlights the continuing challenges faced by Ukraine amid ongoing conflict.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Libya, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, formerly considered one of the most influential figures in the country, was reportedly shot dead. His death marks a significant development in Libya’s complex political and security landscape.</p>
<h2>Justice and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice faced criticism after releasing thousands of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, with victims’ names and sensitive images included. In response to concerns over privacy and safety, many documents have since been removed.</p>
<p>In related news, Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify in the House investigation into Epstein’s activities. The couple will give depositions on separate days later this month as part of the congressional inquiry.</p>
<h2>Social and Digital Policy</h2>
<p>Spain announced plans to ban social media use for children under 16. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez described the move as necessary to protect young people from the dangers of what he called the “digital Wild West.” The ban aims to safeguard children’s mental health and privacy online.</p>
<h2>Health and Science</h2>
<p>A recent report highlights that nearly 40% of cancers worldwide are preventable, amounting to about seven million cases each year. Scientists emphasize the significant opportunity to save lives through lifestyle changes and better prevention strategies.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Community Stories</h2>
<p>In Australia, 13-year-old Austin Applebee shared an extraordinary story of courage after swimming for hours to save his mother and siblings who were swept out to sea. His actions are being described as “superhuman” and have drawn widespread admiration.</p>
<p>In Colombia, BBC correspondent Orla Guerin joined a police unit combating drug gangs in the jungle. The report comes as the presidents of the US and Colombia met to discuss efforts to dismantle illegal cocaine laboratories fueling the cocaine trade.</p>
