    <h2>U.S. Political Developments</h2>
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee after months of resisting subpoenas linked to investigations involving Jeffrey Epstein. The couple's compliance comes as the committee considers holding them in contempt of Congress. This development may lead to further congressional inquiries and sheds light on ongoing questions about Epstein’s network.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, no prosecutions have yet emerged from the release of millions of Epstein-related documents. Analysts are examining why these files have not resulted in legal action, highlighting complexities in pursuing cases from the large and sensitive material.</p>
<h2>Royal Family and Legal News in Norway</h2>
<p>The son of Norway’s crown princess, Marius Borg Høiby, is facing a significant legal battle as his rape trial begins. He is charged with 38 offenses, including four counts of rape, marking one of the biggest criminal cases in Norway in recent years. The trial is unfolding under intense public scrutiny and has implications for the royal family’s reputation.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>Tensions between Colombian President Gustavo Petro and former U.S. President Donald Trump may ease as the two leaders prepare to meet. Despite a history of hostile exchanges, recent interactions suggest some warming in their relationship, potentially impacting U.S.-Colombia diplomatic and economic ties.</p>
<p>On the trade front, India and the United States have reached a long-delayed agreement that lowers tariffs, a move welcomed by parts of the Indian industry. However, experts urge caution until the full details and implementation are clear, indicating that this agreement’s final impact remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Technology and Industry Changes</h2>
<p>In an uncommon move, China has banned the use of hidden car door handles, a design popularized by Tesla and championed by Elon Musk. The ban is based on safety concerns and positions China as the first country to outlaw this feature. This policy may influence automotive design standards globally.</p>
<p>In a related corporate development, Elon Musk’s space exploration company, SpaceX, is merging with his artificial intelligence startup. This consolidation reflects Musk’s efforts to integrate his ventures in cutting-edge technology fields, possibly accelerating innovations in both aerospace and AI sectors.</p>
<h2>Social and Environmental Issues in Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Lagos, Nigeria, residents living in lagoon shanties have witnessed demolitions and fires that have destroyed homes. Many suspect these actions aim to gentrify the waterfront area. However, officials deny that gentrification is the objective. The situation raises concerns about urban development and the rights of vulnerable communities in Nigeria’s largest city.</p>
<h2>U.S. Immigration Policy Update</h2>
<p>A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked the Department of Homeland Security from lifting deportation protections for Haitian migrants. The judge ruled that the DHS Secretary lacked sufficient factual or legal grounds to end the protections at this time. This decision offers temporary relief to Haitian migrants but leaves the issue unresolved as further legal and administrative steps are anticipated.</p>
