    <h2>Justice and Legal Updates</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has removed thousands of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein after criticism arose when victims' names and unredacted images appeared in a recent release. Victims expressed concern about privacy violations in the handling of these sensitive materials. Meanwhile, in Norway, Marius Borg Høiby, the son of Norway’s crown princess, is on trial for alleged rape and more than 30 other offences. The court recently heard a tearful account from the first alleged victim as testimony begins.</p>
<p>Separately, the House oversight committee in the US has reached an agreement with Bill and Hillary Clinton. The couple will testify in the ongoing Epstein investigation with depositions scheduled on two separate days in late February, leading to the shelving of a previously planned contempt vote.</p>
<h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>The US military announced it shot down an Iranian drone approaching an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. This incident highlights ongoing tensions involving Iran and US naval forces in a strategically vital region.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, a "record number of missiles" reportedly struck the country, with over 70 missiles and 450 drones used in an attack following the expiry of a so-called "energy truce." Thousands of people were left without heating amid temperatures as low as -20°C, raising concerns about civilian suffering during the conflict.</p>
<h2>Migration and Humanitarian Tragedy</h2>
<p>A tragic incident occurred near the Greek island of Chios where a collision between a migrant boat and a Greek coastguard vessel resulted in the deaths of 14 migrants. Authorities reported the collision happened during a pursuit, underscoring the ongoing dangers faced by migrants attempting sea crossings in the region.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced plans to ban social media use among children under 16, aiming to protect young people from what he described as a "digital Wild West." This move reflects growing concerns about the impact of social media on children’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>In a remarkable story from Australia, 13-year-old Austin Applebee recounted how he swam for hours to rescue his mother and siblings after they were swept out to sea. His efforts have been hailed as "superhuman" and highlight extraordinary acts of bravery within families during emergencies.</p>
<h2>Health and Science</h2>
<p>A recent scientific report emphasizes that nearly 40% of cancers worldwide, amounting to around seven million cases annually, are preventable. This highlights a major opportunity for public health efforts to reduce cancer rates through lifestyle changes and preventive measures.</p>
<h2>Drug Enforcement Efforts</h2>
<p>As leaders from the US and Colombia met recently, the BBC embedded with Colombian commandos engaged in the ongoing fight against drug gangs. These units work to locate and destroy jungle cocaine labs, illustrating the persistent challenge of combating drug production and trafficking in the region.</p>
