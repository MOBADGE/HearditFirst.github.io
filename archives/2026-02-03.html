    <h2>Justice Department Removes Epstein Documents After Victims Identified</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has taken down thousands of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein’s case after victims were identified in unredacted materials. The latest release had included victims’ names and images without redactions, leading to criticism from those affected. The action highlights ongoing tensions around privacy and transparency in the Epstein investigation. The Department of Justice is now reviewing how to handle sensitive information while continuing the legal process. Meanwhile, Bill and Hillary Clinton have reached an agreement to testify in the investigation, scheduling depositions for late February.</p>
<h2>US Military Shoots Down Iranian Drone Near Aircraft Carrier</h2>
<p>A US military spokesman reported that an Iranian drone was shot down as it approached an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The incident underscores rising tensions between the US and Iran in the region. No injuries or further confrontations were reported following the drone’s destruction. This event may impact ongoing military and diplomatic dynamics and suggests continued vigilance over naval security in contested waters.</p>
<h2>Spain Proposes Social Media Ban for Under-16s</h2>
<p>Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced plans to ban children under 16 from using social media platforms. The government aims to protect young people from harmful online content, describing the internet environment as a "digital Wild West." This move would place restrictions on access to popular social networks for minors, raising discussions about digital safety, parental control, and youth mental health. If enacted, Spain could join other countries considering stricter regulation of children’s internet use.</p>
<h2>Death Reported of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in Libya</h2>
<p>Libyan media report that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, was shot dead. He was 53 years old and once regarded as a prominent figure in Libya’s political landscape. Details about the circumstances of his death remain limited, but this development may affect the country’s ongoing instability and power struggles amid an already fragile political situation.</p>
<h2>Migrant Tragedy Near Greek Island Chios</h2>
<p>A collision between a Greek coastguard vessel and a boat carrying migrants resulted in the deaths of 14 people near the island of Chios. The coastguard was reportedly pursuing the migrant vessel at the time of the collision. This fatal incident highlights the dangers migrants face in the Mediterranean as they attempt to reach Europe. It also raises questions about enforcement methods used in maritime border control and the urgent need for humanitarian responses to migration challenges.</p>
