    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>Political and Legal Developments in the US</h2>
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding their connections to Jeffrey Epstein. This decision follows months of resistance, during which the couple argued that the subpoenas issued to them were invalid. The committee had been considering a vote to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress. Their upcoming testimony could provide new information relevant to ongoing investigations tied to Epstein.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump has sought $1 billion in damages from Harvard University. This action is part of a broader and ongoing dispute between Trump and the Ivy League institution, though specific reasons behind this latest claim were not detailed.</p>
<h2>International Legal Cases and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>In Norway, Marius Borg Høiby, son of the crown princess, has gone on trial facing 38 charges, including four counts of rape. This case is regarded as one of the most significant in Norway in recent years, drawing attention to the royal family during a tense time.</p>
<p>Diplomatically, Iran’s official, Masoud Pezeshkian, announced that the country would pursue “fair and equitable” negotiations with the United States. This statement comes as the US increases its military presence in the Middle East. The prospect of talks marks a notable moment in the strained relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>In Latin America, Colombian President Gustavo Petro is preparing to meet with Donald Trump after a period marked by public disagreements and accusations. Despite recent efforts to ease tensions, the meeting is significant given the leaders’ contentious history.</p>
<h2>Technology and Safety Regulations</h2>
<p>France’s cyber-crime unit conducted a raid on the offices of Elon Musk’s social media company, X, in Paris. The investigation details were not provided, but the authorities are actively probing the company’s operations in France.</p>
<p>Separately, China has implemented a ban on hidden car door handles, which were first popularized by Tesla. This change makes China the first country to prohibit this car design feature citing safety concerns. The regulation affects vehicle manufacturers and the design trends championed by major electric vehicle companies.</p>
<h2>Transportation and Aviation Safety</h2>
<p>Air India has grounded a Boeing jet after its pilot reported a possible defect related to the fuel control switch. This development is occurring while authorities continue to investigate a separate crash involving the same aircraft model that happened last year. The grounding reflects ongoing concerns about the safety of certain Boeing planes in commercial service.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Sports</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing with Egypt at Gaza, a key passage that had been closed. Since the reopening, only a small number of Palestinian patients managed to leave Gaza for medical treatment in Egypt, highlighting continued restrictions on movement.</p>
<p>In the world of international sports, Ukraine’s sports minister criticized Fifa president Gianni Infantino as “irresponsible” and “infantile” after Infantino suggested that lifting the ban on Russia’s participation in international football could be reconsidered. The comments come amid ongoing tensions related to the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine and demonstrate the political sensitivities influencing global sports decisions.</p>
