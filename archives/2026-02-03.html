    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee concerning matters related to Jeffrey Epstein. This decision comes after months of resistance, during which the couple argued that the subpoenas issued by the committee were invalid. Their compliance follows an imminent vote by the House panel to hold them in contempt of Congress, signaling a significant escalation in Congressional inquiries tied to Epstein.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump has filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Harvard University. This latest action is part of an ongoing dispute between Trump and the Ivy League institution, although specific details about the lawsuit's claims were not provided.</p>
<h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukraine has experienced a major attack targeting its energy infrastructure, described as the most powerful of the year so far. The offensive involved over 70 missiles and roughly 450 drones. This assault followed the expiration of a temporary "energy truce" that had been in place until the weekend, raising concerns about escalating conflict impacts on civilian infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Iran's president, Masoud Pezeshkian, announced readiness to engage in negotiations with the United States. He emphasized the goal of achieving "fair and equitable" talks. This development comes at a time when the US is reportedly increasing its military presence in the region, underscoring tensions and the complex diplomatic environment.</p>
<h2>Regional Politics and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The leaders of Colombia and the United States, Gustavo Petro and Donald Trump respectively, are preparing to meet after a period marked by acrimony and public disagreements. Despite recent friendly interactions, the history of exchanged accusations and barbs sets a complicated tone for this upcoming dialogue, which may influence bilateral relations moving forward.</p>
<h2>High-Profile Legal Case in Norway</h2>
<p>Marius Borg Høiby, son of Norway’s crown princess, has appeared in court facing serious charges including 38 accusations with four counts of rape. The trial marks one of the most significant legal cases in Norway in recent years, drawing considerable public and media attention given his connection to the royal family.</p>
<h2>Technology and Safety Regulations</h2>
<p>China has become the first country to ban the use of hidden car door handles, a design popularized by Tesla. The decision was made due to safety concerns, signifying a notable regulatory step in automotive design standards. This move could impact car manufacturers who adopted the sleek handle style, influencing future vehicle designs.</p>
<h2>Aviation Safety Measures</h2>
<p>Air India has grounded a Boeing aircraft model due to a possible defect identified in the fuel control switch, as flagged by a pilot. The action is part of an ongoing investigation related to a previous crash involving the same type of aircraft. This precaution aims to ensure passenger safety amid scrutiny of the aircraft’s operational reliability.</p>
<h2>Developments in the Gaza Strip</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which serves as a crucial exit point for Palestinians. Following Monday’s reopening, only a handful of Palestinian patients managed to leave Gaza to receive medical care in Egypt. The limited movement highlights ongoing challenges faced by residents in the region needing access to advanced medical treatment.</p>
