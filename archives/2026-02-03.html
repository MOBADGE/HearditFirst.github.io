    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>The Clintons have agreed to testify before a House committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein, after initially arguing that the committee's demands were invalid. It remains unclear when their testimony will take place. This development comes as a vote approaches on whether to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress for not complying with the committee's requests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former US president Donald Trump has made headlines by calling on Republicans to "take over the voting" process and "nationalise" US elections—a significant proposal given that American elections are traditionally run under state laws and managed locally. Additionally, Trump announced a lawsuit seeking $1 billion in damages from Harvard University, marking the latest episode in an ongoing dispute between him and the Ivy League institution.</p>
<h2>International Security and Investigations</h2>
<p>Authorities in France conducted raids on offices connected to Elon Musk's social media platform X as investigations intensify. At the same time, the United Kingdom has opened a fresh inquiry into Grok, a platform associated with Musk. These actions underscore growing regulatory scrutiny on emerging social media and technology companies in Europe.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, Russia launched a large-scale assault on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, reportedly using more than 70 missiles and 450 drones. This strike has been described as the "most powerful blow" so far this year and follows the expiration of an energy truce over the weekend. The attack could have significant implications for Ukraine’s energy security and ongoing conflict dynamics.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings in Norway</h2>
<p>Marius Borg Høiby, son of Norway’s crown princess, is facing trial on 38 charges including four counts of rape. The court proceedings are reportedly tense and represent one of the most high-profile cases in Norway in recent years. The case has attracted considerable public attention due to the involvement of a member of the royal family.</p>
<h2>Human Interest Story from Australia</h2>
<p>A remarkable rescue unfolded in Australia where 13-year-old Austin Applebee swam for hours to save his mother and siblings after they were swept out to sea. He described the experience as a "superhuman" effort, highlighting his courage and endurance. This story of bravery and family devotion has resonated widely and serves as a powerful example of resilience.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>At the recent Grammy Awards, US pop singer Chappell Roan attracted attention for wearing a bold, breast-baring chiffon Mugler dress. She later described the outfit as "not that outrageous," reflecting ongoing debates around fashion and expression in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>In Italy, a restored angel fresco resembling the prime minister has sparked an investigation. The artist responsible has denied intentionally modelling the artwork on the political figure, but the controversy highlights sensitivities around art and political figures in public spaces.</p>
<h2>Aviation Safety Update</h2>
<p>India’s aviation regulator has found no defect in the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 jet that was temporarily grounded after a pilot reported a potential issue. The clearance should allow the aircraft to return to service, addressing safety concerns raised by the earlier incident.</p>
