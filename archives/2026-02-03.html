    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>Colombia’s leader, Gustavo Petro, is set to meet with Donald Trump after months of tense relations marked by public disputes. The upcoming meeting may signal a potential thaw or new phase in diplomatic engagement between the two countries. It follows a period of sharply critical exchanges between the leaders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, a judge has temporarily blocked the government’s plan to lift deportation protections for Haitian migrants. The judge ruled that the Department of Homeland Security Secretary lacked sufficient legal and factual grounds for the policy change. This ruling delays efforts to remove many Haitian migrants from the US.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>The son of Norway’s crown princess, Marius Borg Høiby, has appeared in court to face charges including four counts of rape. This case is one of the largest in recent Norwegian history and has created a tense atmosphere for the royal family. The trial’s outcome will be closely watched in Norway.</p>
<p>In the US, former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding Jeffrey Epstein. After resisting subpoenas for months, the couple will now comply ahead of a congressional vote that could hold them in contempt if they refuse. Their testimony may shed light on ongoing investigations related to Epstein.</p>
<h2>Regional Developments in the Middle East and Africa</h2>
<p>Israel has reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt after a period of closure. So far, only a few Palestinian patients have been able to leave Gaza for medical treatment. The reopening offers limited relief amid ongoing humanitarian challenges for people in Gaza.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, residents living in shanties on a Lagos lagoon have seen their homes bulldozed and burnt. Many suspect the demolitions aim to gentrify the waterfront area, but local officials deny this claim. The incident highlights tensions over urban development and displacement in Nigeria’s largest city.</p>
<h2>Technology and Industry</h2>
<p>SpaceX, Elon Musk’s space exploration company, is merging with his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI. This merger is expected to create the world’s most valuable private company, combining advances in both space and AI technologies. The consolidation reflects Musk’s growing influence in multiple high-tech sectors.</p>
<p>In the automotive sector, China has banned the use of hidden car door handles, a design popularized by Tesla. This safety-driven move makes China the first country to prohibit this type of door handle design, signaling increased regulation in vehicle design standards.</p>
<h2>Business and Trade</h2>
<p>India and the United States have signed a long-delayed trade deal that reduces tariffs on certain goods. Indian industries have welcomed the agreement, seeing it as a positive step for trade relations. However, experts advise caution until more details about implementation and benefits become clear, suggesting the deal’s impact will unfold over time.</p>
<h2>Aviation Safety</h2>
<p>Air India has grounded a Boeing jet after its pilot identified a potential defect with a fuel control switch. This action is part of a broader investigation following a plane crash last year involving the same aircraft model. The grounding reflects ongoing safety concerns and the airline’s response to potential technical issues.</p>
