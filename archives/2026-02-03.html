    <h2>US Politics and Epstein Investigation</h2>
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding Jeffrey Epstein, after months of resisting subpoenas. The couple had argued that the committee's demands were invalid, but they decided to comply as congressional votes loom on whether to hold them in contempt. This development may bring new information to the ongoing investigation into Epstein and his connections. However, separate reporting highlights that, despite the release of millions of Epstein-related documents, no prosecutions have resulted so far, leaving many questions about accountability.</p>
<h2>Norwegian Royal Family Under Spotlight as Trial Begins</h2>
<p>Marius Borg Høiby, son of Norway's crown princess, has gone on trial accused of 38 charges, including four counts of rape. The trial is considered one of Norway’s most significant legal cases in recent years and has prompted tense attention on the royal family. The outcome could have broader implications for public perceptions of the monarchy in Norway.</p>
<h2>International Relations: Colombia and US Leaders to Meet</h2>
<p>After months of verbal exchanges, Colombian leader Gustavo Petro and former US President Donald Trump are preparing to meet. Their relationship has been marked by accusations and barbed remarks, but recent signals suggest a slight thaw. This meeting could impact bilateral ties between Colombia and the United States, potentially influencing cooperation on various political and economic issues.</p>
<h2>Technology and Regulation: China Bans Hidden Car Door Handles</h2>
<p>China has become the first country to ban the use of hidden car door handles, a design popularized by Elon Musk’s Tesla vehicles. The move is motivated by safety concerns, reflecting Beijing’s approach to automotive regulation and possibly influencing vehicle design standards globally. This decision may prompt automakers to reconsider design features that prioritize aesthetics over safety.</p>
<h2>Legal Decision on Haitian Migrants in the US</h2>
<p>A US judge has temporarily blocked the government’s attempt to lift deportation protections for Haitian migrants. The ruling criticized the Department of Homeland Security Secretary for lacking sufficient factual and legal backing. This injunction prolongs protections for the migrants amid ongoing debates about immigration policy in the United States.</p>
<h2>Business: SpaceX to Merge with Elon Musk’s AI Company</h2>
<p>Elon Musk’s space exploration company, SpaceX, is set to absorb his artificial intelligence startup, combining their operations. This merger signals Musk’s growing interest in integrating AI technologies with space ventures, potentially accelerating innovation in both fields. The deal may reshape the landscape of private space and AI sectors under Musk’s leadership.</p>
