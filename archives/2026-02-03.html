    <h2>Epstein Documents Withdrawn After Victim Identification</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has removed thousands of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein after victims were identified within the files. Victims criticized the release for including their names and unredacted images, raising concerns about privacy and safety. This development highlights ongoing tensions in handling sensitive materials connected to Epstein’s criminal cases and underscores the challenges in balancing transparency with victim protection.</p>
<h2>US Military Shoots Down Iranian Drone Near Aircraft Carrier</h2>
<p>A US military spokesperson reported that an Iranian drone was shot down while approaching an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The incident reflects ongoing regional tensions and heightened vigilance in the area surrounding key military assets. This event may impact diplomatic and military interactions between the US and Iran, raising questions about future confrontations or efforts to de-escalate.</p>
<h2>Spain Proposes Ban on Social Media Use for Under-16s</h2>
<p>Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced plans to ban social media access for children under 16 years old. The policy aims to shield young people from what Sánchez described as the "digital Wild West," addressing concerns about online safety and mental health. If adopted, it could reshape youth internet use in Spain and potentially influence other countries’ approaches to regulating social media for minors.</p>
<h2>Report: Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Killed in Libya</h2>
<p>Libyan media reported that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the former Libyan leader and once considered a powerful figure in the country, was killed recently at age 53. His death marks a significant moment in Libya’s ongoing instability and set of power struggles. The implications for Libya’s political situation and prospects for peace or further unrest remain uncertain.</p>
<h2>Migrant Boat Collision Leaves Fourteen Dead Near Greece</h2>
<p>A tragic accident off the Greek island of Chios resulted in the deaths of fourteen migrants after their boat collided with a Greek coastguard vessel. The coastguard was reportedly pursuing the boat at the time of the collision. This event highlights the dangers faced by migrants attempting sea crossings in the Mediterranean and raises questions about enforcement tactics and migrant safety.</p>
<h2>Progress in Epstein Investigation: Clintons to Testify Before House Committee</h2>
<p>The House oversight committee has put aside plans to hold the Clintons in contempt after the couple agreed to testify in the investigation related to Jeffrey Epstein. They are scheduled to appear on separate days in late February for depositions. This agreement represents a key step in the ongoing inquiry and may provide further insights into Epstein’s network and associated allegations.</p>
