    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Russia resumed large-scale attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure after a week-long pause that was meant as a temporary “energy truce.” The offensive involved over 70 missiles and 450 drones targeting key sites. This escalation could deepen the humanitarian and economic impact of the conflict, as energy supply disruptions intensify.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel reopened the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Monday, allowing a small number of Palestinian patients to leave Gaza for medical treatment. The reopening could provide some relief amid ongoing tensions, though access remains limited.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, President Donald Trump is seeking $1 billion in damages from Harvard University, continuing a long-running dispute involving the Ivy League institution. The legal action adds a new chapter to their ongoing conflict.</p>
<p>Back in the US political arena, Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding Jeffrey Epstein after months of resisting subpoenas. This move comes as Congress considers holding them in contempt, marking a significant development in the congressional investigation.</p>
<h2>Diplomacy and International Relations</h2>
<p>Iran’s president stated that the country is open to negotiating with the United States, aiming for “fair and equitable” talks. This declaration comes amid increasing US military presence in the region, highlighting ongoing tensions and the possibility of diplomatic engagement.</p>
<p>Additionally, Colombia’s president Gustavo Petro is preparing to meet with Donald Trump. Despite a history of criticism and accusations between the two leaders, recent interactions have been more cordial, potentially signaling a shift toward improved bilateral relations.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings in Norway</h2>
<p>Marius Borg Høiby, the son of Norway’s crown princess, is on trial facing 38 charges, including four counts of rape. The case is one of the most high-profile in the country in recent years and poses a challenging moment for the Norwegian royal family’s public image.</p>
<h2>Business and Regulatory News</h2>
<p>Paris prosecutors’ cyber-crime unit raided the offices of Elon Musk’s social media company X as part of an investigation. The details of the probe have not been fully disclosed but underline growing scrutiny of the platform.</p>
<p>Separately, China has banned the use of hidden car door handles, a design popularized by Tesla. This move raises new safety standards and makes China the first country to prohibit such designs, potentially impacting automotive trends and manufacturers globally.</p>
<h2>Aviation Safety</h2>
<p>Air India has grounded a Boeing aircraft after a pilot raised concerns about a possible defect in the fuel control switch. The decision comes amid ongoing investigations into a previous crash involving the same model, reflecting heightened safety measures in commercial aviation.</p>
