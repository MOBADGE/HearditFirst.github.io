    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 01, 2026</div>
    <h2>Royal Family and Epstein Links</h2>
<p>Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has expressed agreement with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's assessment of her own judgment concerning her past contacts with Jeffrey Epstein. The princess had acknowledged poor judgment in her interactions with Epstein, the late convicted sex offender. This admission comes amid ongoing public scrutiny as more information related to Epstein continues to emerge.</p>
<h2>Jeffrey Epstein Interview Released</h2>
<p>Newly released video footage from the US Department of Justice shows Jeffrey Epstein being questioned by an unnamed interviewer. The content is part of a vast collection of files made public and provides insight into Epstein’s mindset and behavior. This release may contribute to further understanding of the circumstances surrounding his criminal activities and their wider implications.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>A recent strike near a bus carrying miners in Ukraine, attributed to Russian forces, has resulted in the deaths of twelve miners, with fifteen others reported injured. This incident underscores the continuing violence and instability in the region affecting civilians, especially workers in conflict zones. The situation remains tense, with risk to non-combatants ongoing.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Protests</h2>
<p>Erfan Soltani, an Iranian protester previously reported to be facing execution after participating in anti-government demonstrations, has been released on bail according to recent reports. The release marks a notable development amid Iran’s crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile, Venezuela has also released Javier Tarazona, a rights activist, as part of a series of prisoner releases reportedly influenced by international pressure.</p>
<h2>Immigration and Detentions in the US</h2>
<p>A five-year-old boy and his father, previously detained by the US immigration agency ICE, have returned to Minnesota following their release. A judge had ordered the boy's release, describing the detention as “cruel” and lacking basic humanity. The case has drawn attention to the treatment of children and families within the US immigration system.</p>
<h2>Regional Tensions and Security</h2>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader has issued a warning of potential regional conflict should the United States carry out any attacks. This statement comes as Iran prepares to conduct a live-fire naval exercise in a strategically important shipping route. The warning follows comments by former US President Donald Trump, who noted ongoing serious discussions regarding Iran’s actions. This development adds to existing tensions in the area with possible implications for maritime security.</p>
