    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 01, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security</h2>
<p>Tensions in the Middle East remain high as Iran's supreme leader warned of the risk of a regional war if the United States launches an attack. This comes amid Iran's announcement of a live-fire naval exercise near a key shipping route. Earlier comments from former US President Donald Trump indicated that Iran was engaged in "serious discussions," though details were not specified. The situation highlights ongoing concerns about stability in a strategically vital area and the potential for escalation affecting global maritime traffic.</p>
<h2>Middle East Humanitarian and Political Issues</h2>
<p>Israel has announced plans to ban the international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) from operating in Gaza. The decision follows MSF's refusal to share its staff list with Israeli authorities. MSF cited concerns about the safety of its personnel as the reason for withholding the information. This development could have significant implications for medical aid delivery in Gaza amid ongoing conflicts and humanitarian needs.</p>
<h2>Violence and Conflict in South Asia</h2>
<p>Deadly violence struck Pakistan's Balochistan province, where coordinated gun and bomb attacks resulted in the deaths of 31 civilians and 17 security personnel, according to the Pakistani military. The military reported retaliatory actions that killed 145 attackers. These incidents underscore the ongoing security challenges in the region and raise concerns about civilian safety and stability.</p>
<h2>Developments Related to Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
<p>Newly released documents have revealed financial transactions and personal connections involving Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender:</p>
<p>- Records suggest Epstein sent $75,000 to accounts linked to Lord Mandelson, a British figure who has stated he has no recollection or record of receiving these funds and is uncertain about the authenticity of the documents.</p>
<p>- Images emerged showing director Brett Ratner in the company of Epstein and unidentified women; these surfaced on the day Ratner's documentary about the US first lady was released.</p>
<p>- Slovakia's prime minister's national security adviser, Miroslav Lajčák, resigned after exchanges were revealed in which he discussed girls and diplomacy with Epstein.</p>
<p>- Casey Wasserman, the head of the organizing committee for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, expressed deep regret over flirty emails he exchanged with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate. These emails were part of files published by the US Department of Justice.</p>
<p>These revelations continue to draw attention to Epstein's wide-ranging influence and raise questions about accountability in political and cultural spheres.</p>
<h2>Swiss Fire Tragedy</h2>
<p>Tragedy unfolded in Switzerland as an 18-year-old Swiss national died from injuries sustained in a bar fire. This brings the death toll from the incident to 41. Authorities are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the fire and its aftermath as the community mourns the loss of life.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Cultural News</h2>
<p>French technology company Capgemini announced it will sell its US subsidiary that provides services to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. This decision comes amid increased global scrutiny over ICE's enforcement methods.</p>
<p>On the cultural front, anticipation builds for the 2026 Grammy Awards, with coverage focusing on who will perform and compete for the prestigious music awards. The event attracts worldwide attention as a major moment in the entertainment calendar.</p>
