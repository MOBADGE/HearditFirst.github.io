    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 01, 2026</div>
    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>A Russian strike in Ukraine killed twelve miners and injured seven others near a bus carrying workers on Sunday. The strike highlights ongoing violence in the region, affecting civilian infrastructure and workers.</p>
<p>In Pakistan's Balochistan province, deadly gun and bomb attacks claimed the lives of 31 civilians and 17 security forces. The Pakistani military responded, reporting it killed 145 attackers. This incident underscores continued instability and conflict in the area.</p>
<h2>International Tensions</h2>
<p>Iran's supreme leader issued a warning of potential regional war if the United States launches an attack. This comes as Iran prepares to begin a live-fire naval exercise in a strategically important shipping route. Meanwhile, Donald Trump stated that Iran is engaged in "serious discussions," signaling ongoing diplomatic uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Rights activist Javier Tarazona was released in Venezuela amid a series of prisoner releases by the government. These actions are occurring under U.S. pressure for reforms, possibly signaling a response to calls for improved human rights conditions.</p>
<p>In the United States, a five-year-old boy named Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, who had been detained by immigration enforcement, were released and returned to Minnesota. A U.S. congressman confirmed the boy was home safely, marking a significant moment in immigration enforcement cases.</p>
<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
<p>An 18-year-old Swiss national died from injuries sustained in a Swiss bar fire, bringing the death toll from the incident to 41. The victim passed away at a Zurich hospital, reflecting the ongoing toll from this tragedy.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, aspiring singer Ifunanya Nwangene, a former contestant on The Voice Nigeria, died after a snake bite. She reportedly did not receive the antivenom needed, raising concerns about access to emergency medical care in such situations.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Organizational Responses</h2>
<p>The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said it will be banned from operating in Gaza by Israeli authorities after refusing to provide a staff list, citing concerns over the safety of their personnel. This ban could impact medical aid efforts in the region.</p>
<p>French technology company Capgemini announced plans to sell its U.S. subsidiary, which works with U.S. immigration enforcement (ICE). This decision comes amid worldwide scrutiny of ICE's enforcement methods, indicating possible corporate distancing from controversial practices.</p>
<h2>Financial Allegations</h2>
<p>Documents suggest that Jeffrey Epstein sent $75,000 to accounts linked to Lord Mandelson. Lord Mandelson has stated he has no record or memory of receiving these sums and questioned the authenticity of the documents. This development could prompt further investigation into financial dealings.</p>
