    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 01, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Incidents and Conflicts</h2>
<p>A Russian strike near a bus carrying miners in Ukraine resulted in the deaths of twelve miners and injuries to fifteen others. This attack underscores the ongoing violence in the region and the risks faced by civilians. Meanwhile, tensions remain high in the Middle East. Iran’s supreme leader warned of the possibility of a regional war should the US launch an attack, amid Iran’s commencement of a live-fire naval exercise in a strategic shipping route.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Reports indicate that Iranian protester Erfan Soltani, who was previously slated for execution following his arrest during anti-government protests, has been released on bail. In Venezuela, rights activist Javier Tarazona was also released as part of the government’s recent prisoner release efforts, which come in response to pressure from the United States for political reforms.</p>
<p>In the United States, a five-year-old boy and his father detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have returned to Minnesota after a judge ordered the boy’s release, citing the conditions of his detention as "cruel" and lacking "human decency." This case highlights ongoing debates about immigration enforcement practices.</p>
<h2>Health and Humanitarian News</h2>
<p>Israel has announced a ban on the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) from operating in Gaza. The decision comes after MSF refused to provide a list of its staff, stating concerns about the ability to ensure their safety. This development poses challenges for medical aid delivery in the Gaza region.</p>
<h2>Royal Family Controversy</h2>
<p>Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre publicly agreed with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's own admission of "poor judgement" in maintaining contacts with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The princess’s remarks and the PM’s response bring renewed attention to the implications of associations with Epstein, who remains a figure of significant scandal.</p>
<h2>Cultural Milestone</h2>
<p>In entertainment news, the song "Golden" became the first K-Pop track to win a Grammy Award, marking a notable achievement for the genre on a major international stage. Additionally, British artists The Cure, Yungblud, and FKA Twigs received their first Grammy awards during the ceremony held in Los Angeles, recognizing their contributions to music.</p>
<h2>Tragedy in Switzerland</h2>
<p>An 18-year-old Swiss national has died from injuries sustained during a fire at a bar, increasing the death toll from the incident to 41. Authorities continue investigations to understand the causes and circumstances surrounding the fire, which has deeply affected the local community.</p>
