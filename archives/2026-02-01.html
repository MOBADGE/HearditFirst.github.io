    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 01, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in several parts of the world today. In Ukraine, officials report that a Russian strike struck near a bus carrying miners, killing twelve and injuring fifteen. This attack adds to ongoing conflict and instability in the region. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Iran’s supreme leader warned of a potential regional war if the United States launches an attack. This threat comes as Iran plans to begin a live-fire naval exercise in a strategically important shipping route, increasing concerns about possible confrontation.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>There have been significant updates relating to human rights and legal actions globally. In Iran, Erfan Soltani, who was arrested in connection with anti-government protests and reportedly faced execution, has been released on bail. This development comes amid continuing domestic unrest. In Venezuela, human rights activist Javier Tarazona was freed, part of a series of prisoner releases announced by the government, likely influenced by international pressure for reforms.</p>
<p>In the United States, a five-year-old boy and his father, both detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), returned to Minnesota after a judge ordered the boy’s release, calling the detention "cruel" and "bereft of human decency.” This case sheds light on ongoing debates over immigration enforcement and family separation policies.</p>
<h2>Norway’s Royal Controversy</h2>
<p>Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has expressed agreement with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's own remarks about her contacts with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, characterizing her judgment in the matter as “poor.” The princess had acknowledged these links previously, and the prime minister’s statement highlights continued attention to the issue within Norway’s public and political circles.</p>
<h2>Health and Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>In Gaza, Israel announced it will ban the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), after the charity refused to provide a list of its staff, citing concerns over their safety. This move raises concerns about the availability and safety of medical aid in the region amid ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>In music news, K-pop group Demon Hunters made history by winning a Grammy award early in the ceremony held in Los Angeles. The event also marked a milestone for UK artists, with The Cure, Yungblud, and FKA Twigs becoming the first British winners of the night, reflecting a diverse and international lineup of celebrated performers.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Switzerland</h2>
<p>A fire in a Swiss bar has resulted in the death of an 18-year-old teenager, bringing the total casualties from the incident to 41. The young victim passed away at a hospital in Zurich, according to local authorities, highlighting the ongoing investigation and community mourning following this tragedy.</p>
