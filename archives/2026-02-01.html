    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 01, 2026</div>
    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>A deadly Russian strike in Ukraine has claimed the lives of twelve miners near a bus carrying workers, with seven others injured. The attack underscores ongoing dangers for civilians in the conflict area and raises concerns about continued violence affecting non-combatants.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Iran's supreme leader warned of a potential regional war if the United States launches an attack. The announcement comes as Iran prepares a live-fire naval exercise near a crucial shipping route, heightening tensions. Earlier, a US official mentioned that Iran is engaged in "serious discussions," possibly indicating diplomatic talks or strategic maneuvers.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Justice</h2>
<p>Reports from Iran indicate that Erfan Soltani, a protester initially facing execution for participating in anti-government protests, has been released on bail. This development may signal some easing of state actions against demonstrators, although the situation remains fragile.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, the government has released rights activist Javier Tarazona, part of a series of prisoner releases amid pressure from the United States for political reforms.</p>
<p>In the United States, a five-year-old boy and his father, previously detained by immigration authorities, have returned to Minnesota after a judge ruled the boy’s detention was "cruel" and lacked "human decency." This case highlights ongoing concerns about immigration enforcement practices.</p>
<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
<p>A tragic fire incident in Switzerland has resulted in the death of an 18-year-old teenager, increasing the death toll from the blaze to 41. The victim died in a hospital in Zurich as investigations continue into the cause and response to the fire.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, aspiring singer Ifunanya Nwangene, a former contestant on The Voice Nigeria, has died following a snake bite. She was unable to receive the necessary antivenom treatment, emphasizing challenges in access to emergency healthcare in some regions.</p>
<h2>Organizations and Business</h2>
<p>Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) is set to be banned from operating in Gaza by Israeli authorities. The organization refused to provide a staff list, citing concerns about the safety of its workers, reflecting ongoing difficulties for aid groups in conflict zones.</p>
<p>French technology company Capgemini announced plans to sell its US subsidiary, which has contracts with the US immigration enforcement agency ICE. The move follows growing global scrutiny of ICE’s enforcement methods and may indicate broader corporate responses to reputational risks tied to immigration policies.</p>
<h2>Financial and Political News</h2>
<p>Newly surfaced documents suggest that Jeffrey Epstein sent $75,000 to accounts linked to Lord Mandelson. Mandelson has stated he has no record or memory of receiving these funds and expressed uncertainty about the authenticity of the documents. This development adds complexity to ongoing examinations of financial dealings connected to Epstein.</p>
