    <h2>Middle East Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>A significant escalation in conflict between the US, Israel, and Iran has unfolded, marked by a series of deadly strikes and retaliations. Early US and Israeli airstrikes targeted locations in Iran, including a compound in central Tehran, leading to the reported death of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, as confirmed by Iranian state television. The operation was based on months of intelligence gathering, with crucial intel arriving just hours before the attack.</p>
<h2>Casualties and Strikes</h2>
<p>Reports indicate that at least 148 people died following a strike on a school in Iran, an event for which Iran has blamed the US and Israel. The US is currently investigating these claims, while Israel's military says it is not aware of operations in the area targeted. In retaliation, Iran launched missile and drone attacks against Israel and four Gulf Arab countries hosting US military bases. These responses have led to deaths across the Middle East, including nine casualties reported in Israel due to a missile attack.</p>
<h2>Regional Impact and Ongoing Hostilities</h2>
<p>Iran's retaliatory strikes highlight the broader regional impact of the conflict, involving multiple countries in the Middle East. The US and Israel conducted extensive missions against Iran, underscoring the intensity of military engagement in the region. Iran's use of missiles and drones against US-aligned targets signifies a potential widening of hostilities that could affect geopolitical stability in the area.</p>
<h2>Health and Technology Issues</h2>
<p>In unrelated news, a growing health trend involves people injecting unregulated peptides, substances not intended for human consumption, in hopes of wellness benefits. Experts warn that users are essentially experimenting on themselves, raising concerns about safety and regulation.</p>
<p>Separately, WhatsApp is facing legal challenges in India over its 2021 privacy policy update which requires users to share data with Meta to continue using the service. This ongoing dispute highlights increasing global scrutiny of online privacy and data protection practices.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This overview captures recent developments in Middle Eastern conflict, health trends, and technology policy challenges, illustrating how global and local issues continue to affect many aspects of life.</p>
