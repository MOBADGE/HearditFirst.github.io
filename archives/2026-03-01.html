    <h2>Escalation of US-Israel Strikes and Iranian Retaliation</h2>
<p>On March 1, 2026, Iran confirmed that its supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, was killed during a series of massive air strikes by the US and Israel. These attacks targeted multiple locations across Iran, marking a significant escalation in tensions between the countries. In response, Iran launched missile and drone strikes against Israel and four Gulf Arab nations hosting US military bases, showing the conflict’s potential to widen across the region.</p>
<h2>Civilian Casualties and Controversies</h2>
<p>Among the reported casualties, Iran stated that a school near elite military areas was hit, resulting in the deaths of 108 people. Neither the US nor Israel has confirmed this claim. The incident raises concerns about civilian harm amid the retaliatory strikes and the ongoing conflict, drawing international attention to the humanitarian impact of the military actions.</p>
<h2>Political and Regional Impact</h2>
<p>Analysts describe the killing of Khamenei as a profound shock to Iran’s leadership. The country is expected to try to demonstrate it has a clear succession plan and maintain control despite this crisis. Meanwhile, US and Israeli officials see the moment as a strategic opportunity, noting that Iran’s regime faces vulnerabilities, including economic difficulties and the lingering effects of past protests. This fragile situation may influence the trajectory of the conflict and regional stability moving forward.</p>
<h2>International Reactions</h2>
<p>World leaders are actively responding to the unfolding situation, weighing the implications of US and Israeli strikes and Iran’s counterattacks. The evolving conflict has drawn widespread diplomatic attention, with many watching closely to see how other countries might respond to this escalation in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Additional News: Wellness Trends and Privacy Concerns</h2>
<p>Separately, there is a rising trend of injecting unregulated peptides for health and wellness purposes, despite warnings from experts about the potential risks, likening those who use such substances to "lab rats." Meanwhile, in India, WhatsApp faces legal challenges over a 2021 privacy policy update that requires users to share data with Meta to continue using the service, a point of contention in ongoing debates over digital privacy.</p>
