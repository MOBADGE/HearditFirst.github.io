    <h2>Major Strikes and Death of Iran’s Supreme Leader</h2>
<p>On March 1, 2026, Iranian state television confirmed that the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, was killed. His death occurred during the first day of a series of large-scale air strikes carried out by the US and Israel on various locations in Iran. The attacks targeted military and other strategic sites, with one reported strike hitting a school near elite military forces, resulting in the deaths of 108 people. However, neither the US nor Israel has confirmed this particular incident.</p>
<h2>Iran’s Retaliation and Regional Tensions</h2>
<p>In response to the strikes, Iran launched missile and drone attacks aimed at Israel and four Gulf Arab nations that host US military bases. These counterattacks have further heightened tensions in the Middle East, with the risk of broader conflict increasing. The situation remains volatile as Iran seeks to demonstrate it has a clear plan following the sudden loss of its supreme leader.</p>
<h2>International and Regional Reactions</h2>
<p>Global leaders are closely monitoring the unfolding crisis. Some see this moment as critical, recognizing the potential for significant shifts in regional dynamics. Analysts note that Iran has been preparing for a disruptive event like this, but the death of Khamenei presents a major challenge to the Islamic Republic’s stability. The US and Israel view Iran’s current economic difficulties and recent domestic protests as indicators of the regime’s vulnerability, seeing an opportunity to reshape the situation in their favor.</p>
<h2>Broader Context and Observations</h2>
<p>The strikes and Iran’s response mark a dangerous moment with risks of escalation. Observers caution that the coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining the future path of Iran and its relations with neighboring countries and global powers. The developments also underscore ongoing issues in the Middle East, where conflicts can quickly expand and draw in multiple actors. Monitoring will continue to assess how the situation evolves and what diplomatic efforts might emerge to prevent wider war.</p>
