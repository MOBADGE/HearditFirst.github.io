    <h2>Middle East Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>A wave of violence has swept across the Middle East following coordinated strikes by the US and Israel targeting Iran. Iranian state television confirmed that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, was killed early on the first day of these strikes. This marks a significant turning point in the region's long-standing tensions.</p>
<p>In response, Iran launched missile and drone attacks not only towards Israel but also targeted four Gulf Arab countries that host US military bases. These retaliatory strikes resulted in several deaths across the region. In Israel, nine people were reported killed due to missile attacks linked to the ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>Casualties and Controversy Over School Strike</h2>
<p>Among the most tragic reports is the death toll of at least 153 people following a strike on a school in Iran. Iran has blamed the US and Israel for this attack. However, the Israeli Defense Forces stated they were not aware of operations in the area, and the US is currently investigating the incident. This raises concerns about civilian safety and the complexities of military action in densely populated areas.</p>
<h2>Intelligence and Planning Behind the Attacks</h2>
<p>The US and Israeli strikes were preceded by months of planning. According to reports, crucial intelligence arrived just hours before an operation against a compound in central Tehran. This intelligence was vital for conducting the mission targeting Iranian leadership. The precision and timing of the strikes suggest a highly coordinated effort aimed at disrupting Iran's command structure.</p>
<h2>Broader Regional Impact</h2>
<p>The conflict has implications beyond Iran and Israel. The missile and drone attacks by Iran affected multiple countries in the Gulf region, signaling a broader escalation that could destabilize the area further. The US military presence in these Gulf countries makes them targets and significant players in the unfolding events.</p>
<h2>Other News Briefs</h2>
<p>In unrelated news, a growing number of people are injecting unregulated peptides for wellness purposes, despite warnings from experts who describe these users as "lab rats" due to the unknown health risks. Meanwhile, WhatsApp faces a legal challenge in India over its 2021 privacy policy update, which requires users to share data with Meta for advertisement purposes to continue using the app. These stories highlight ongoing discussions about health choices and digital privacy worldwide.</p>
