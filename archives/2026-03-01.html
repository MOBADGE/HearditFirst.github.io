    <h2>Middle East Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>A series of air strikes and missile attacks have significantly escalated tensions in the Middle East. Early reports say more than 150 people died after a reported strike on a school in Iran. Iran has blamed the United States and Israel for the attack, though the US is still investigating, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say they are unaware of operations in that area.</p>
<p>In response, Iran launched missile and drone strikes targeting Israel and four Gulf Arab countries that host US military bases. These retaliatory attacks have caused at least nine deaths in Israel and further casualties across the region. The series of strikes mark a sharp increase in violence after coordinated US-Israel operations against Iran.</p>
<h2>Death of Iran’s Supreme Leader</h2>
<p>Amid the conflict, Iranian state television confirmed that Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, has died on the first day of the US and Israeli air strikes. This development represents a significant change in Iran’s leadership during a critical moment of regional tension. The months-long planning behind the US-Israeli mission reportedly culminated after receiving key intelligence just hours before the attack.</p>
<p>The death of Khamenei could have major implications for Iran’s political future and for the ongoing conflict in the region, though the immediate consequences remain uncertain.</p>
<h2>Background on US-Israel Mission</h2>
<p>Details have emerged about the US and Israeli operation targeting Iran. The military action was reportedly based on crucial intelligence obtained shortly before the attack on a compound in central Tehran. This operation appears to be part of a broader effort to weaken Iran’s leadership and military capabilities in response to perceived threats.</p>
<p>Following the strikes, Iran launched its own attacks using missiles and drones, highlighting a rapid and forceful cycle of retaliation.</p>
<h2>Other News: Wellness Trends and Legal Challenges</h2>
<p>In unrelated news, there is growing attention to the use of wellness peptides. Many people are injecting these unregulated substances, which are not approved for human consumption, aiming to improve health. Experts warn that users are effectively acting as “lab rats” due to unknown risks and lack of regulation surrounding these drugs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WhatsApp is facing legal challenges in India over its privacy policy, introduced in 2021. The policy requires users to share data with Meta for advertising purposes to continue using the app. Legal scrutiny focuses on data privacy concerns and the implications for Indian users.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories reflect ongoing geopolitical conflict and regional instability in the Middle East, alongside developments in health trends and data privacy issues worldwide. The situation in Iran especially remains fluid, with potential for further escalation.</p>
