    <h2>Middle East Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>Recent conflict in the Middle East intensified after US and Israeli air strikes targeted locations across Iran on March 1, 2026. Iranian state television reported a strike on a school resulting in at least 148 deaths. Iran blamed the United States and Israel for the attack. The US is currently investigating the incident, while Israel’s Defense Forces said they are not aware of any operations in that area. In the chaos of these strikes, Iran's supreme leader was reported killed, ending his long-standing hold on power.</p>
<h2>Iran’s Retaliation and Regional Impact</h2>
<p>In response to the US and Israeli attacks, Iran launched missiles and drones toward Israel and four Gulf Arab countries that host US military bases. The retaliatory strikes caused debris from intercepted Iranian drones and missiles to fall over airports in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, leading to the death of one person and injuries to 11 others, as well as widespread damage. This escalation increases tensions across the Gulf region and raises concerns about further conflict involving multiple countries.</p>
<h2>US-Israel Military Actions Overview</h2>
<p>The recent air strikes by the US and Israel across Iran mark a significant military operation, triggering swift retaliatory attacks from Iran. Detailed coverage of the events shows a rapid sequence of strikes and counters in the region. The unfolding situation remains fluid, with ongoing investigations into specific incidents and potential further responses by the involved parties.</p>
<h2>Privacy Concerns Around WhatsApp in India</h2>
<p>Separately, in technology news, WhatsApp faces a legal challenge in India over its 2021 privacy policy update. The policy requires users to share certain data with Meta, WhatsApp’s parent company, for advertising purposes to continue using the service. This has raised questions over user privacy and data protection in one of WhatsApp’s largest markets.</p>
<h2>Health Risks of Unregulated Peptides</h2>
<p>There is a growing trend of people injecting unregulated peptides marketed for wellness and health enhancement. Experts caution against this practice, warning that many individuals using these substances are essentially "lab rats" due to the lack of regulation and potential health risks. This highlights ongoing challenges in public health and regulation of emerging wellness products.</p>
