    <h2>Conflict in Iran</h2>
<p>On March 1, 2026, Iran experienced large-scale air strikes carried out by the US and Israel. These strikes targeted several locations, including a site near elite military troops. Iranian state television reported that the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, was killed during the attacks, marking an unprecedented change in Iran’s power structure. The strikes and the leader's death represent a significant escalation in tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Iran’s Retaliation</h2>
<p>Following the air strikes, Iran launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and four Gulf Arab countries hosting US military bases. Iranian officials stated that a school was hit in one of the strikes, resulting in 108 deaths, though the US and Israel have not confirmed this specific incident. Iran is responding forcefully to what it sees as direct aggression, raising concerns about further escalation in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>International Reactions</h2>
<p>World leaders are closely watching the unfolding crisis. The strikes and Iran’s retaliation have sparked varied responses globally, reflecting the complexity of the situation. Many countries are concerned about the risk of wider conflict following the disruption caused by the attacks and the sudden leadership vacuum in Iran.</p>
<h2>Regional Context and Future Outlook</h2>
<p>Experts note that the killing of Iran’s supreme leader is a major shock to the Islamic Republic. Iran is expected to try to project control and demonstrate it has a plan for the future despite the sudden loss of its highest authority. The US and Israel view this moment as an opportunity, assessing Iran as vulnerable due to ongoing economic challenges and the effects of recent protests. How Iran manages the aftermath will be crucial for regional stability.</p>
<h2>Other News: Technology and Health</h2>
<p>In unrelated news, WhatsApp faces a legal challenge in India over its 2021 privacy policy update. This policy requires users to share data with Meta, WhatsApp’s parent company, to continue using the service, raising privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Separately, there is growing use of unregulated wellness peptides, substances marketed for health benefits. Medical experts warn that people injecting these substances are essentially experimenting on themselves without adequate safety information. This trend highlights ongoing challenges in regulating health and wellness products.</p>
