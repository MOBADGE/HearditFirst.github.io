    <h2>Iran Supreme Leader Khamenei Killed Amid US-Israel Strikes</h2>
<p>On March 1, Iranian state TV confirmed that Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has been killed. This announcement came on the first day of large-scale air strikes by US and Israeli forces targeting multiple locations within Iran. The death of Khamenei marks a historic turning point, ending his long hold on power.</p>
<p>This event has sent shockwaves through the region. Iran’s leadership faces immediate pressure to respond and maintain control during this critical moment. Analysts suggest that Tehran will work swiftly to show it has a plan to handle the sudden leadership change.</p>
<h2>Iranian Retaliation and Regional Tensions</h2>
<p>Following the strikes and the killing of Khamenei, Iran launched missiles and drone attacks targeting Israel as well as four Gulf Arab countries hosting US military bases. These retaliatory measures highlight the rapid escalation of conflict in the Middle East, with the potential to further destabilize an already volatile region.</p>
<p>Claims from Iran indicate that the US and Israel strikes hit a school, resulting in the deaths of 108 people. However, this report has not been independently verified, and neither the US nor Israel has confirmed targeting the school.</p>
<h2>Global Reactions to the Strike and Conflict</h2>
<p>World leaders have responded cautiously to the unfolding crisis. The attacks and Iran’s subsequent missile launches have heightened international concern about potential wider conflict. Countries in the Middle East and beyond are closely monitoring the situation, with diplomatic efforts likely to focus on preventing further escalation.</p>
<p>Experts describe this as an extraordinary moment for Iran, one that the country has been preparing for internally, though the sudden loss of Khamenei presents a serious challenge.</p>
<h2>US and Israel Perspectives on the Situation</h2>
<p>Officials in the US and Israel view the current moment as a rare strategic opportunity. They believe the Iranian regime is vulnerable due to ongoing economic difficulties and the aftermath of internal protests. Both countries appear intent on pressing their advantage while maintaining readiness for Iran’s responses.</p>
<p>The strikes and Iran’s retaliation underscore a period of heightened tension but also significant geopolitical maneuvering by the US and Israel.</p>
<h2>Other Noteworthy Developments</h2>
<p>Separately, wellness trends are seeing increased use of unregulated peptides injected by individuals seeking health benefits, though experts warn of the risks involved as these drugs are not approved for human use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in India, WhatsApp’s 2021 privacy policy update, which requires sharing user data with parent company Meta for advertising purposes, faces legal challenges. This continues a broader global debate over data privacy and user consent in digital communication platforms.</p>
