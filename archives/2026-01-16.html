    <h2>Middle East Protests and Tensions</h2>
<p>Reza Pahlavi, an exiled opposition leader based in the US, has called for "surgical" strikes against Iran's Revolutionary Guards as part of efforts to support protesters seeking to topple Iran's government. This comes amid continuing unrest in Iran, where authorities have imposed an internet blackout to limit information flow. Iranians at the border with Iraq have described ongoing violence and further protests, highlighting the escalating crisis on the ground. These developments reflect deepening instability in the region and raise questions about potential international responses.</p>
<h2>Venezuela's Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado has pledged to lead the country when "the right time comes," following the US seizure of its president. Meanwhile, a US official reported that the CIA director recently held a two-hour meeting with Venezuela's new leader in Caracas. The discussions focused on economic opportunities and preventing Venezuela from becoming a base for US adversaries. These events suggest continued US engagement and shifting power dynamics in Venezuela’s political landscape.</p>
<h2>International Trade and Diplomatic Relations</h2>
<p>China and Canada have agreed to ease tariffs after a high-stakes meeting between Canadian official Mark Carney and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The deal centers on canola oil and electric cars and follows years of strained trade relations between the two countries. In contrast, tensions involving the United States and Greenland have intensified, with the US president threatening new tariffs on nations opposing America's Greenland takeover. This tension persists even as a bipartisan group of US lawmakers is engaged in talks with Denmark to ease concerns over the territory.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Political Unrest in Africa and Asia</h2>
<p>Uganda’s presidential election is ongoing, with President Yoweri Museveni leading with about 75% of the vote based on half of the polling results. However, overnight clashes have resulted in the deaths of opposition supporters, indicating volatility during the electoral process. In Myanmar, the government is defending itself in a landmark genocide case at the United Nations court, arguing that The Gambia has not presented sufficient evidence of genocide against the Muslim minority population. Meanwhile, the US has accused South Africa's military of "cosying up to Iran" after reports emerged that the military defied orders to expel Iran from naval drills. South Africa’s defence minister has ordered an inquiry into these allegations.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in Asia</h2>
<p>South Korea’s former president Yoon has been sentenced to five years in prison in the first of several verdicts related to his 2024 martial law decree. This sentence marks a significant moment in the ongoing legal processes tied to political actions taken during his administration.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These global developments highlight ongoing challenges including political unrest, international diplomacy, and legal accountability across multiple regions. Each situation may have broader implications for regional stability and international relations in the near future.</p>
