    <h2>Iran Protests and Opposition Calls for Action</h2>
<p>Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition figure and exiled crown prince of Iran, has called on the international community to help topple Iran's government. He specifically urged targeting the leadership of Iran's Revolutionary Guards amid ongoing protests inside the country. Meanwhile, BBC reports from the Iran-Iraq border reveal continuing violence and unrest as Iranian authorities impose an internet blackout to restrict information flow. Protesters have faced harsh crackdowns, including being hit with pellets. These developments highlight intensifying tensions and growing calls for external support against the Iranian government.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in Venezuela</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado reaffirmed her intention to lead the country when "the right time comes." This statement follows the US seizure of Venezuela’s president, reflecting ongoing political instability. Separately, a high-level meeting took place in Caracas between the CIA director and Venezuela’s new leader, focusing on economic opportunities and preventing the country from becoming a base for America's adversaries. These interactions suggest the US is closely monitoring Venezuela’s evolving political landscape and seeking to influence future outcomes.</p>
<h2>Trade Tensions Ease Between China and Canada</h2>
<p>After years of strained relations, China and Canada have announced relief from tariffs on key products including canola oil and electric cars. The agreement came following a high-stakes meeting between Mark Carney and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. This development marks a step forward in trade relations between the two countries, potentially benefiting exporters and industries affected by previous trade barriers.</p>
<h2>US Threatens Tariffs Over Greenland Dispute</h2>
<p>In another trade-related development, the US president threatened to impose new tariffs on countries opposing the US takeover efforts in Greenland. This statement came amidst a visit by a bipartisan group of US lawmakers to Denmark, aiming to ease tensions over the Arctic territory. The threat underscores ongoing diplomatic disputes related to Greenland's strategic importance and resource potential.</p>
<h2>Election Developments in Uganda and Legal Proceedings in South Korea</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni is heading towards victory with about 75% of votes counted. However, his main rival has accused the election process of foul play, pointing to potential challenges ahead. Meanwhile, in South Korea, the country's former president Yoon Seok-youl was sentenced to five years in prison over his 2024 martial law attempt. This verdict is the first in a series of trials linked to that shock decree and indicates ongoing judicial reckoning with political actions during that period.</p>
<h2>Myanmar’s Defense at UN Genocide Case and South Africa’s Military Inquiry</h2>
<p>Myanmar has begun its defense at the International Court of Justice against genocide accusations brought by The Gambia related to the treatment of the Muslim-minority Rohingya. Myanmar’s representatives argued that The Gambia had not provided sufficient evidence to prove genocide. Separately, in South Africa, the defence minister has ordered an inquiry into reports that the military ignored orders to expel Iran from naval drills. This inquiry comes after US accusations of South Africa’s military developing close ties with Iran, illustrating concerns about shifting alliances and regional security implications.</p>
