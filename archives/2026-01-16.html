    <h2>Global Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>A new initiative called the "Board of Peace" has been launched to address the conflict in Gaza. The White House announced that the board’s founding executive members include former UK prime minister Tony Blair and former US secretary of state Marco Rubio. This group aims to provide leadership on peace efforts, though specific plans or actions have not yet been detailed. Their involvement signals an ongoing international commitment to seek resolutions in the Gaza region.</p>
<h2>Unrest and Opposition in Iran</h2>
<p>Protests continue in Iran despite government attempts to restrict information through an internet blackout. People near the Iraq border described violent clashes, including injuries from pellet shots. Reza Pahlavi, an opposition figure living in the US and an exiled crown prince, urged the international community to support demonstrators by targeting the leadership of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. The situation remains tense as protesters call for government changes.</p>
<h2>Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Machado declared she has a mandate to lead the country following the recent US seizure of its president. Machado expressed readiness to take charge "when the right time comes," signaling potential shifts in the country's political landscape. Meanwhile, the CIA director met for two hours in Caracas with the new Venezuelan leader to discuss economic opportunities and ways to prevent the country from becoming a base for adversaries of the US.</p>
<h2>Economic Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>China and Canada have agreed to ease tariffs after a high-level meeting between Mark Carney and Xi Jinping. The agreement focuses on key products such as canola oil and electric cars. This development follows years of strained trade relations and could lead to increased bilateral commerce.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on countries opposing the US takeover of Greenland. This statement came as a bipartisan group of US lawmakers visited Denmark, trying to reduce tensions over the strategic Arctic territory.</p>
<h2>Legal and Military Issues</h2>
<p>In South Korea, former president Yoon was sentenced to five years in prison related to a 2024 martial law decree, marking the first verdict among several trials linked to this event.</p>
<p>At the United Nations court, Myanmar began its defense in a genocide case filed by The Gambia. Myanmar denied sufficient evidence was provided to prove genocide against the Muslim minority group.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the defense minister ordered an investigation into reports of military officers disregarding orders to exclude Iran from naval drills, amid US accusations that the South African military is aligning too closely with Iran. The inquiry aims to clarify these allegations and ensure compliance with military directives.</p>
