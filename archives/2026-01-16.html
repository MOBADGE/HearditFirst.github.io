    <h2>Protests and Unrest in Iran</h2>
<p>Reza Pahlavi, an opposition figure living in the US, has called for international support to help protesters overthrow Iran's government. He specifically urged the global community to target the leadership of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, a powerful military force in the country. Meanwhile, on the ground near the Iran-Iraq border, many Iranians report ongoing violent clashes with authorities. Protesters have faced harsh tactics such as pellet shots, and the government continues to restrict information flow by maintaining an internet blackout. These developments suggest escalating tensions and a worsening humanitarian situation with limited outside access to reliable updates.</p>
<h2>Political Shifts in Venezuela</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, an opposition leader named Machado has stated she intends to lead the country when the "right time comes." Her remarks come after the US seized the country's president, creating a power vacuum. Additionally, the CIA director recently held a two-hour meeting in Caracas with Venezuela's new leader to discuss economic opportunities and concerns about preventing the country from becoming a base for adversaries of the US. These events highlight ongoing uncertainty and diplomatic efforts amid Venezuela’s political upheaval.</p>
<h2>Trade Developments Between China and Canada</h2>
<p>China and Canada have reached a new trade agreement after a high-level meeting between Mark Carney and Xi Jinping. The deal centers on easing tariffs, notably on Canadian canola oil and Chinese electric cars. This agreement marks an important step in improving economic ties following years of strained relations between the two nations. Reduced tariffs could help stabilize trade flows and benefit industries on both sides.</p>
<h2>US and Greenland Tensions</h2>
<p>Tensions remain between the US and other countries over Greenland’s status after a recent US proposal to take over the territory. The US president issued a warning about imposing new tariffs on nations opposing the move. This statement came as a bipartisan group of US lawmakers were visiting Denmark in attempts to ease the diplomatic friction. The situation reflects ongoing geopolitical competition in the Arctic region and raises questions about future cooperation.</p>
<h2>Elections and Legal Cases in Africa and Asia</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Museveni appears headed for victory with about 75% of votes counted from over half of the polling stations. However, the main opposition is contesting the results, alleging irregularities. In Myanmar, the government has begun its defence at the UN court against genocide accusations brought by The Gambia. Myanmar denies that sufficient evidence has been presented. These political and legal developments point to continuing struggles over governance and accountability in both countries.</p>
<h2>Legal Verdict for South Korea's Former President</h2>
<p>South Korea’s former president Yoon has been sentenced to five years in prison. The verdict stems from trials connected to his controversial declaration of martial law in 2024. This is the first verdict to be issued among four trials related to the decree, reflecting ongoing legal reckoning with the political crisis that unfolded two years ago.</p>
