    <h2>Global Trade Developments</h2>
<p>China and Canada have agreed to ease tariffs on canola oil and electric cars, marking a thaw in their previously tense relations. The deal was reached after a high-stakes meeting between Mark Carney and China’s Xi Jinping, signaling a potential improvement in trade cooperation between the two countries. This development could benefit industries and consumers in both nations by reducing costs and increasing market access.</p>
<h2>Political and Social Unrest</h2>
<p>In Iran, reports from near the Iraq border reveal ongoing protests met with violent responses by authorities. People there describe being hit by pellet shots amid a government-imposed internet blackout aimed at restricting information flow. The situation highlights continuing unrest and government efforts to control public expression and external communication.</p>
<h2>US and Geopolitical Tensions</h2>
<p>US lawmakers are attempting to ease diplomatic tensions as President Donald Trump increases pressure to annex Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Recent high-level discussions in Washington have failed to dissuade Trump from pursuing this controversial plan, raising questions about future US-Danish relations and strategic interests in the Arctic region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CIA director held a two-hour meeting with Venezuela’s new leader in Caracas. They discussed potential economic opportunities and ways to prevent Venezuela from becoming a base for adversaries of the United States. This dialogue points to ongoing efforts to influence political and economic dynamics in Latin America.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Changes in Asia and Africa</h2>
<p>South Korea’s former president Yoon has been sentenced to five years in prison related to his 2024 decree on martial law. This marks the first verdict among four trials connected to that controversial decision, reflecting judicial scrutiny of political leadership in the country.</p>
<p>In Uganda, the presidential election results show President Museveni leading with approximately 75% of the vote from over half of the polling stations counted. However, overnight clashes between security forces and opposition supporters have resulted in fatalities, underscoring political tensions during the election period.</p>
<h2>Science and Security Updates</h2>
<p>Scientists have produced an unprecedentedly detailed map of the landscape beneath Antarctica’s ice sheet. This new data could improve understanding of how the vast ice mass might react to climate change, providing valuable insights for environmental research and policy.</p>
<p>On the security front, the US has accused the South African military of maintaining close ties with Iran despite orders to exclude Iran from naval drills. South Africa’s defence minister has ordered an inquiry into the alleged breach, indicating internal investigations and potential regional ramifications.</p>
<p>In criminal justice news, actor Timothy Busfield, known for his roles in the TV series The West Wing and the film Field of Dreams, has been charged with sexually abusing boys on a TV series set. Additionally, a man accused of murdering a woman and her toddler in a Munich car attack, an Afghan national, has gone on trial. Both cases are ongoing and remain under judicial examination.</p>
