    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 16, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Early results from Uganda's presidential election show President Museveni with a strong lead, securing about 76% of the vote from nearly half of the polling stations. Meanwhile, in South Korea, a former president named Yoon has been sentenced to five years in prison. This verdict is the first in a series of four trials connected to a controversial martial law decree he issued in 2024.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to former U.S. politician Donald Trump. Trump described the act as "a wonderful gesture of mutual respect." This symbolic exchange highlights ongoing political interactions involving Venezuelan opposition figures and the former U.S. leader.</p>
<h2>U.S. Domestic Affairs</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to protests against immigration enforcement in Minnesota. This law, which is rarely used, would enable the president to deploy active-duty military personnel for law enforcement purposes. The announcement underscores tensions related to immigration policies and the government’s response to public demonstrations.</p>
<h2>Environment and Science</h2>
<p>Scientists have created an unprecedentedly detailed map of the landscape beneath Antarctica's ice sheet. Researchers hope this new information will help them understand how Antarctica's vast ice masses might respond to climate change in the coming years. This could improve predictions about global sea-level rise and the planet’s climatic future.</p>
<h2>Regional Conflicts and Security</h2>
<p>Cuba is assessing the consequences of its alliance with Venezuela after 32 Cuban troops were killed there. These losses have drawn attention to the strategic risks Cuba faces due to its involvement in foreign military or security operations. This development may lead to changes in Cuba's international commitments and military strategy.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Crime</h2>
<p>Actor Timothy Busfield, known for his roles in the TV series "The West Wing" and the film "Field of Dreams," has been charged with sexually abusing boys on the set of a television series. In Australia, a woman who accused high-profile twins, Oren and Alon Alexander, of sexual assault was found dead in Sydney late last year. These events highlight ongoing concerns about abuse and the justice system’s handling of such allegations.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>Flooding in northern South Africa has resulted in the deaths of at least 19 people in recent weeks. Due to the severity of the floods, a famous safari park in the region has been shut down temporarily. The disaster has caused significant disruption and loss of life, underlining vulnerability to extreme weather events in the area.</p>
<h2>Human Interest</h2>
<p>In Australia, a woman named Rachel Bloor woke to find a massive python resting on her chest. Initially, she thought the weight was her dog. This unusual incident attracted attention as an example of unexpected wildlife encounters in residential areas.</p>
