    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 16, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Diplomacy and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>A new "Board of Peace" has been announced to help address the conflict in Gaza. The White House revealed that former UK prime minister Tony Blair and former US secretary of state Marco Rubio will be part of the founding executive board. This board aims to support peace initiatives in the region, although details about its specific plans have yet to be made public.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Iran, opposition voices continue to call for significant change. Reza Pahlavi, an exiled opposition figure based in the US, urged the international community to target the leadership of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. This comes amid ongoing protests in Iran, where people near the border with Iraq described experiencing violence, including being hit by pellets. The Iranian government continues to block information flow through an internet blackout, making it difficult to assess the full scale of the unrest.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader Maria Machado declared that she plans to lead the country when the "right time comes," following the US's seizure of the country's president. This announcement signals her intention to take a more prominent role in the nation's leadership in the near future.</p>
<p>Adding to the political scene in Venezuela, the US CIA director recently met with the new Venezuelan leader in Caracas for two hours. According to a US official, their discussions focused on economic opportunities for Venezuela and efforts to prevent the country from becoming a hub for adversaries of the United States. This meeting highlights continued American involvement in Venezuela’s political and economic future.</p>
<h2>International Trade and Sanctions</h2>
<p>In North America and Asia, trade relations experienced a positive shift as China and Canada announced tariffs relief following a high-stakes meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Canada's Mark Carney. The deal centers around key goods like canola oil and electric cars, products that have been points of tension between the two countries in recent years. This development could ease trade strains and improve economic relations after a period of difficulties.</p>
<p>However, tensions remain elsewhere. US President Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on countries opposed to the US takeover of Greenland. This warning came while a bipartisan group of US lawmakers was visiting Denmark to try to soften strained relations over the territory, underscoring ongoing diplomatic challenges surrounding the issue.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns and Military Affairs</h2>
<p>The US has accused the South African military of "cosying up to Iran," which prompted South Africa’s defence minister to order an inquiry. Reports suggested the military ignored orders to expel Iran from naval drills, raising questions about South Africa's military alignment and its consequences for international relations and security cooperation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Myanmar began its defence at the United Nations court in a landmark genocide case brought by The Gambia. Myanmar argued that The Gambia failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove genocide against the Muslim minority population. This case represents a significant moment in international law and human rights accountability.</p>
<h2>Elections in Africa</h2>
<p>Uganda's presidential election is nearing a likely conclusion with President Museveni leading strongly. With results from over half of the polling stations, Museveni had about 75% of the vote. His main rival, however, has alleged irregularities and cried foul over the election process. This development may affect the political stability and direction of Uganda moving forward.</p>
