    <h2>Middle East Unrest and Opposition Calls</h2>
<p>Reza Pahlavi, an exiled Iranian opposition figure based in the US, has urged the international community to support protesters seeking to overthrow Iran's current government. He specifically called for targeting the leadership of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, a powerful military force. Meanwhile, on the ground at the Iran-Iraq border, Iranians spoke of violent clashes with security forces amid ongoing protests. Many reported being hit by pellets fired by authorities. The Iranian government has imposed an internet blackout to restrict information flow, making it difficult to verify details of the situation. These developments highlight escalating tensions in Iran and raise questions about the prospects for change and international involvement.</p>
<h2>Venezuela's Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado said she has a mandate to lead the country and plans to do so "when the right time comes." Her statement follows the US seizure of Venezuela's president, which has intensified political uncertainty. Additionally, the CIA director recently held a two-hour meeting with Venezuela's new leader in Caracas. The discussion included economic opportunities and concerns about preventing Venezuela from becoming a base for adversaries of the United States. These interactions indicate ongoing US involvement in Venezuela's complex political and economic landscape.</p>
<h2>Economic Relations between China and Canada</h2>
<p>China and Canada announced relief from tariffs following a high-profile meeting between Mark Carney, a Canadian official, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The agreement involves trade in products like canola oil and electric vehicles, areas that had previously caused friction between the two countries. This development marks a step toward easing long-standing trade tensions, which could benefit industries and consumers in both nations.</p>
<h2>US and Greenland Dispute</h2>
<p>Tensions over Greenland continue as the US president threatened to impose new tariffs on countries opposing the US plan to take over the territory. These comments came while a bipartisan group of US lawmakers visited Denmark to attempt to ease diplomatic strains related to the issue. The situation remains fragile, with the threat of tariffs highlighting how disputes over territory can impact broader international relations and trade.</p>
<h2>African and Asian Political Updates</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni is on course for another electoral victory, holding about 75% of the vote from over half of the polling stations. However, his main rival has alleged electoral fraud, which could lead to increased political tensions in the country.</p>
<p>In South Korea, former president Yoon Suk-yeol was sentenced to five years in prison over his attempt to impose martial law during political unrest in 2024. This is the first verdict in several ongoing trials related to those events and represents a significant moment in the country's recent political history.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Myanmar has begun its defense in a genocide case at the UN court brought by The Gambia. Myanmar denies the allegations, claiming insufficient evidence has been presented. The case centers on accusations of genocide against the Muslim-minority Rohingya population, a matter of international concern.</p>
<h2>US-South Africa Military Relations</h2>
<p>The US has accused South Africa's military of being too close to Iran amid reports that its forces ignored orders to expel Iran from multinational naval drills. In response, South Africa’s defence minister ordered an inquiry into these reports. The situation raises questions about South Africa's regional security role and its relationship with both Western countries and Iran.</p>
