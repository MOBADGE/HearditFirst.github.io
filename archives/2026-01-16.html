    <h2>Global Peace Initiative</h2>
<p>A new peace effort focused on the conflict in Gaza has been announced by the White House. The initiative includes a "founding executive board" with prominent figures such as former UK prime minister Tony Blair and former US secretary of state Marco Rubio. The board aims to bring together experienced leaders to promote peace and stability in the region. Their involvement signals an international commitment to addressing ongoing tensions and may influence diplomatic efforts moving forward.</p>
<h2>Developments in Iran</h2>
<p>Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition figure and exiled crown prince of Iran, has called on the international community to support protesters seeking to overthrow the Iranian government. He specifically urged action against the Revolutionary Guards' leadership. Meanwhile, people living near Iran’s border with Iraq reported continuing violence, including being hit by pellets during protests. Iranian authorities have responded by enforcing an internet blackout to limit information flow. These reports highlight growing unrest within Iran and the challenges facing protestors in their efforts to draw global attention.</p>
<h2>US and Greenland Tensions</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US and Denmark over Greenland remain high. The US president threatened to impose new tariffs on countries opposing a US takeover of the territory. This threat came as a bipartisan group of US lawmakers visited Denmark, hoping to ease diplomatic strains. The situation underscores ongoing disputes about strategic control and economic interests related to Greenland.</p>
<h2>Political Situations in Africa and Venezuela</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Museveni is heading toward victory in recent elections, with about 75% of the vote counted. However, his main rival has alleged unfairness in the electoral process, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the results. Meanwhile, Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado declared she will lead the country when the time is right, following the US seizure of the sitting president. This stance comes amid ongoing political instability in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The CIA director had a two-hour meeting with Venezuela’s new leader in Caracas to discuss economic opportunities and strategies to prevent the nation from becoming a base for adversaries of the US. This meeting reflects continued US engagement in Venezuelan affairs despite political complexities.</p>
<p>On the trade front, China and Canada have agreed to relieve some tariffs after a high-level meeting between Mark Carney and Xi Jinping. The deal centers on products like canola oil and electric cars, indicating progress in easing years of trade tensions.</p>
<p>Separately, Myanmar has begun its defense in a genocide case brought by The Gambia at the United Nations court. Myanmar disputes the evidence presented regarding alleged genocide against its Muslim minority population. This legal proceeding is closely watched by the international community as a test of accountability for alleged human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Finally, in South Africa, the defense minister has ordered an inquiry into reports suggesting the military ignored orders to expel Iranian forces from naval exercises. The US has criticized South Africa’s military for “cosying up” to Iran, signaling friction in defense and diplomatic alignments.</p>
