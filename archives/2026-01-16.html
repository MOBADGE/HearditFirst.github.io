    <h2>International Trade</h2>
<p>China and Canada have agreed to ease tariffs on canola oil and electric cars after a meeting between Mark Carney and Xi Jinping. This development marks a thaw in trade relations following years of tension. The tariff relief could improve bilateral trade and benefit industries in both countries, particularly in agriculture and clean energy sectors. This deal may lead to increased economic cooperation and a reduction in trade disputes going forward.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest and Protest</h2>
<p>In Iran, renewed clashes have been reported at the border with Iraq amid ongoing protests. Witnesses described being hit in the face by pellets during the confrontations. The Iranian government continues to enforce an internet blackout, limiting the flow of information from the region. These events highlight the ongoing unrest and the challenges people face in communicating their experiences outside the country.</p>
<h2>US-Denmark Relations Over Greenland</h2>
<p>Members of the US Congress visited Denmark amid heightened tensions related to Greenland. This visit followed unsuccessful high-level talks in Washington aimed at dissuading Donald Trump from his plan to annex Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. The situation reflects ongoing diplomatic challenges between the US and Denmark and raises questions about the future of Greenland's governance and international status.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in South Korea</h2>
<p>Former South Korean president Yoon has been sentenced to five years in prison. This marks the first verdict linked to four trials regarding Yoon's controversial martial law decree issued in 2024. The sentence underscores accountability efforts related to political decisions that had significant national impact and may influence ongoing legal proceedings involving former officials.</p>
<h2>Climate and Environment</h2>
<p>Scientists have produced the most detailed map yet of the landscape beneath Antarctica's ice. This new information is expected to enhance understanding of how Antarctica's massive ice sheet might respond to climate change. The mapping could improve climate models and predictions about sea-level rise, contributing to global efforts to prepare for environmental changes.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Severe flooding in South Africa, worsened by climate change, has led to the closure of Kruger National Park and resulted in at least 19 deaths in recent weeks. In Uganda, opposition supporters were killed overnight amid ongoing elections, with President Museveni leading with around 75% of the vote from over half the polling stations. Additionally, legal proceedings are underway in Munich for a man accused of killing a woman and her toddler in a car attack, and actor Timothy Busfield has been charged with sexually abusing boys on a TV series set. The CIA director recently met with Venezuela's new leader to discuss economic opportunities and preventing the country from becoming a base for US adversaries.</p>
