    <h2>Middle East Protests and Calls for Action</h2>
<p>Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition figure and exiled crown prince, has urged the international community to help protesters in Iran who are seeking to topple the government. He specifically called for targeting the leadership of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Meanwhile, near the border with Iraq, Iranians describe ongoing violence during protests, including accounts of people being hit by pellets. Despite the unrest, Iranian authorities continue to enforce an internet blackout, limiting the flow of information and making it difficult to fully assess the situation on the ground.</p>
<h2>Venezuela's Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado has declared that she will lead the country when the "right time comes," following the US seizure of the Venezuelan president. Separately, the CIA director held a two-hour meeting with the new Venezuelan leader in Caracas. According to a US official, discussions focused on economic opportunities and preventing Venezuela from becoming a base for groups unfriendly to the United States. These developments signal ongoing tensions and shifting power dynamics in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>International Trade and Diplomatic Moves</h2>
<p>China and Canada have announced a relief in tariffs after a high-stakes meeting between Mark Carney, Canada's special envoy, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The agreement centers around canola oil and electric cars, marking a step forward after years of strained relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, in the United States, the president threatened to impose new tariffs on countries opposing a US plan to take over Greenland. This threat came as a bipartisan group of US lawmakers visited Denmark, which governs Greenland, seeking to ease tensions over the territory.</p>
<h2>African Elections and Conflict</h2>
<p>In Uganda, opposition supporters have been killed in overnight clashes as President Yoweri Museveni leads the vote count with roughly 75% of the total ballots from more than half of polling stations. The election has sparked violence and raised concerns about the fairness and stability of the process. At the same time, in South Africa, the US has accused the military of "cosying up to Iran." South Africa's defence minister has ordered an inquiry into reports that the military ignored orders to expel Iran from naval exercises.</p>
<h2>Legal and Judicial News in Asia</h2>
<p>South Korea's former president Yoon has been sentenced to five years in prison related to a controversial martial law decree he issued in 2024. This marks the first verdict in a series of trials examining his actions during that period. In Myanmar, the government has begun defending itself in a landmark genocide case at the United Nations court. Myanmar argues that the country bringing the case, The Gambia, has not provided sufficient evidence to prove genocide against the Muslim-minority population.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories reflect ongoing political tensions, conflicts, and shifting alliances across several regions, signaling that the global landscape remains complex with significant humanitarian, legal, and diplomatic challenges ahead.</p>
