    <h2>Iran Protests and International Response</h2>
<p>Reza Pahlavi, an opposition figure living in the United States, has called on the international community to support efforts to remove Iran's current government. He specifically urged targeting the leadership of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. Meanwhile, Iranians near the Iraq border described ongoing protests met with violence, including pellet injuries, as authorities maintain an internet blackout to limit information flow. These developments highlight continuing unrest and the difficulty of monitoring the situation inside Iran.</p>
<h2>Venezuela’s New Leadership and US Relations</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, an opposition leader vowed to assume leadership at the appropriate time following the US seizure of the country’s president. The new Venezuelan leader recently held a two-hour meeting with the CIA director in Caracas. Discussions focused on economic opportunities as well as preventing Venezuela from becoming a base for adversaries of the United States. These events suggest shifting power dynamics and ongoing US involvement in Venezuelan affairs.</p>
<h2>Trade Developments Between China and Canada</h2>
<p>After years of strained relations, China and Canada agreed to ease tariffs on goods including canola oil and electric cars. The deal was reached following a high-level meeting between Mark Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This tariff relief could help improve trade between the two countries and may ease broader tensions.</p>
<h2>Territorial Dispute Over Greenland</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high surrounding Greenland’s status. The US president threatened new tariffs on countries opposing a US takeover of the territory. This threat came as bipartisan US lawmakers visited Denmark to de-escalate the situation. Though negotiations are ongoing, the dispute could affect relations between the US and its allies.</p>
<h2>Other Global News</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Museveni appeared headed for re-election with about 75% of votes from over half the polling stations reported, amid complaints from his main rival. South Korea’s former president Yoon was sentenced to five years in prison for a 2024 martial law attempt, marking the start of verdicts in related trials. At the UN, Myanmar began its defense in a genocide case brought by The Gambia. Myanmar contended that The Gambia lacked sufficient evidence of genocide against the Muslim minority. Additionally, the US accused South Africa’s military of maintaining ties with Iran despite orders to exclude it from naval exercises; South Africa’s defense minister is investigating these claims.</p>
