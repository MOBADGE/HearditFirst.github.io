    <h2>Iran Protests and Exiled Opposition</h2>
<p>Exiled Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, based in the US, has called on the international community to help protesters in Iran by targeting the leadership of the Revolutionary Guards. Widespread protests continue within Iran despite a government-imposed internet blackout aimed at restricting information flow. Reports from Iranians at the Iraq border describe ongoing violence, including the use of pellet guns against demonstrators. These developments highlight the ongoing unrest and the challenges faced by protesters seeking change amid government suppression.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado has expressed her intention to lead the country when the "right time comes," claiming a mandate that follows the recent US seizure of the country's president. Meanwhile, the CIA director held a two-hour meeting with Venezuela’s new leader in Caracas. Their discussion included economic opportunities and efforts to prevent Venezuela from becoming a base for adversaries of the United States. These interactions underscore the complex political situation and shifting influence within Venezuela.</p>
<h2>US, China, Canada, and Greenland Tensions</h2>
<p>China and Canada have agreed to ease tariffs on products such as canola oil and electric vehicles after high-level talks between Mark Carney and Xi Jinping. This agreement comes after years of strained trade relations and signals a thaw in economic tensions between the two countries. Meanwhile, in the Arctic region, the United States is experiencing diplomatic strain as President Trump threatened new tariffs on countries opposing a US move to take over Greenland. The threat was made amidst efforts by US lawmakers to ease tensions with Denmark, which governs Greenland.</p>
<h2>African Elections and International Concerns</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni is heading towards victory with approximately 75% of votes counted from over half of polling stations. His main opponent has accused the election process of unfairness. Across the continent, the US has raised concerns over South Africa’s military allegedly maintaining ties with Iran, despite orders to exclude Iran from naval exercises. South Africa’s defence minister has ordered an inquiry into reports that the military ignored these directives, reflecting ongoing attention to military alliances and geopolitical partnerships in Africa.</p>
<h2>Legal and International Justice Cases</h2>
<p>In Myanmar, the government has begun its defence in a landmark genocide case brought at the United Nations court by The Gambia. Myanmar contends that The Gambia has not provided sufficient evidence of genocide against the Muslim-minority Rohingya population. Additionally, South Korea’s former president Yoon has been sentenced to five years in prison related to his 2024 martial law decree in a series of four connected trials. These cases highlight ongoing international legal efforts concerning human rights and accountability.</p>
