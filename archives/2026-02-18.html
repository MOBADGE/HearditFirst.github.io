    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks End Without Progress</h2>
<p>The second round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia concluded after just two hours, with no breakthroughs achieved. The talks, described as "difficult," did not result in any agreements, leaving the conflict unresolved for now. This ongoing stalemate suggests that diplomatic efforts face significant obstacles as both sides remain entrenched in their positions.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Syria’s Alawite Minority</h2>
<p>Women from Syria's Alawite minority have shared distressing reports of kidnappings and sexual assaults. These attacks appear to target members of the sect associated with former President Assad. The accounts highlight ongoing human rights abuses amid the country’s extended conflict, underlining the vulnerability of minority communities.</p>
<h2>Turkey Rejects Israel’s Recognition of Somaliland</h2>
<p>Turkey’s president, during an official visit to Ethiopia, criticized Israel’s recent recognition of Somaliland. He described the move as potentially dangerous for regional stability, reflecting tensions over the political status of Somaliland and concerns about its impact on an already volatile area in the Horn of Africa.</p>
<h2>Avalanche Rescue Efforts Underway in California</h2>
<p>Rescue teams are actively searching for nine skiers reported missing after a significant avalanche in California. The area experienced around 30 inches (76 cm) of snowfall in the last 24 hours, contributing to hazardous conditions. Efforts continue amid challenging weather as responders race to locate those missing.</p>
<h2>Trial Begins Over Death on Austria’s Highest Mountain</h2>
<p>A climber is on trial accused of abandoning his girlfriend near the summit of Austria's highest mountain during a blizzard. The woman, Kerstin G, was reportedly left unprotected and exhausted. The case raises ethical and legal questions about responsibility and safety in extreme mountain environments.</p>
<h2>Australia Bans Citizen’s Return from IS Camp in Syria</h2>
<p>Australia has temporarily banned a citizen from returning after this person was among 34 individuals attempting to leave an IS camp in Syria. The move reflects the country’s ongoing efforts to control the return of people affiliated with or suspected of association with the group, amid broader security concerns.</p>
