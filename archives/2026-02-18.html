    <h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Recent peace talks between Ukraine and Russia have ended without any progress. The second day of negotiations lasted just two hours and did not produce a breakthrough. The short duration and lack of agreement highlight ongoing difficulties in resolving the conflict between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>In France, authorities have detained eleven people over the killing of Quentin Deranque, a far-right student activist. The arrests come amid growing pressure on the far left, as investigators work to uncover the circumstances around the incident. Police continue their inquiries to clarify the motives and connections related to the killing.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accidents</h2>
<p>A suspected carbon-monoxide leak in a Nigerian mine has resulted in the deaths of 37 miners. The incident likely occurred just before sunrise as the workers were close to finishing their shift. Rescue and investigation efforts are ongoing to determine the exact cause and prevent further tragedies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in California, rescuers are searching for nine skiers missing after an avalanche. Heavy snowfall is expected to continue in the region over the coming days, which may hamper rescue operations. Authorities are monitoring conditions closely to assist the search teams.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Human Rights</h2>
<p>The BBC has reported harrowing accounts from women of Syria’s Alawite minority, describing experiences of kidnapping and rape. These assaults appear to specifically target the sect historically associated with former President Assad. The testimonies shed light on the continuing human rights challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Technology and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has arrived to testify in a trial examining whether Instagram negatively affects children. The questioning focuses on the social media platform’s role in contributing to addiction and potential harm among young users. The case could have implications for how social media companies manage user wellbeing.</p>
