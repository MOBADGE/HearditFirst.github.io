    <h2>International Conflict and Human Rights</h2>
<p>Women from Syria’s Alawite minority have shared disturbing stories of kidnapping and rape. These assaults appear to be targeting this specific sect associated with the family of former President Assad. The reports highlight ongoing violence and human rights abuses amid the Syrian conflict, underscoring the continued dangers faced by minority communities in the region.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Talks between Ukraine and its counterparts have entered their second day in Geneva. The US special envoy expressed cautious optimism, describing the progress as "meaningful," though he tempered expectations for a sudden breakthrough. These discussions come amid ongoing conflict and are seen as an important step toward potential de-escalation, though the path to a lasting agreement remains uncertain.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Rescue Efforts</h2>
<p>An avalanche in California has left around ten skiers missing after a heavy snowfall of about 30 inches (76 cm) over the past 24 hours. Rescue teams are actively searching for the missing individuals as they race to reach the area. The incident serves as a reminder of the risks faced by mountain enthusiasts and the challenges involved in emergency response during extreme weather conditions.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in Austria</h2>
<p>A climber is on trial in Austria accused of abandoning his girlfriend near the summit of the country’s highest mountain during a blizzard. The woman, exhausted and left unprotected, ultimately died as a result. The trial is drawing attention to issues of responsibility and safety in high-risk mountaineering activities.</p>
<h2>Political Changes in Latin America and the Philippines</h2>
<p>Peru’s Congress has removed José Jerí from the presidency just four months after he took office. He is the third president ousted in recent years and the nation’s seventh since 2016, highlighting ongoing political instability. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, Vice President Sara Duterte announced her candidacy for president in 2028. She is known for her high-profile disputes with the current administration and is the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, signaling a potential continuation of her family’s political influence.</p>
