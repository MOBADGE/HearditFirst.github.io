    <h2>Natural Disaster in California</h2>
<p>Fifteen skiers went missing after a large avalanche struck the Lake Tahoe area in California on Tuesday. Rescue teams found eight skiers dead, while one person remains missing and is presumed dead. The incident highlights the dangers of avalanches in winter sports regions and raises concerns over safety measures in such areas.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The United States recently announced its support for a deal involving the Chagos Islands, a strategic location in the Indian Ocean. However, President Donald Trump urged the United Kingdom not to give away Diego Garcia, part of the Chagos archipelago, signaling ongoing tensions about the territory's future. This dispute involves long-standing geopolitical interests and could affect relations between the US, UK, and other countries.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia ended after just two hours without any breakthroughs. The negotiations were described as "difficult," underscoring the continued challenges in resolving the conflict. The lack of progress suggests that tensions remain high and that further diplomatic efforts will be necessary to find a resolution.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest and Legal Proceedings in South Korea</h2>
<p>South Korea is awaiting a court verdict in the insurrection trial of Yoon Suk Yeol. The situation is part of a broader context involving martial law and widespread protests in the country. This trial marks a significant moment in South Korea’s political landscape and may influence the country's future governance and stability.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Safety Concerns Worldwide</h2>
<p>A suspected carbon monoxide leak in Nigeria has reportedly killed at least 30 miners. Witnesses say the gas buildup occurred in poorly ventilated tunnels, pointing to concerns about mine safety. Meanwhile, in Iran, a security official appeared to open fire on a crowd at a cemetery where people were commemorating victims of a government crackdown on protests. Both incidents reflect ongoing issues of safety and civil unrest in different parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Notable Testimonies and Cultural Highlights</h2>
<p>Les Wexner, former CEO of Victoria's Secret, testified before US lawmakers that he was "naive" and "conned" by Jeffrey Epstein, who allegedly stole large sums of money from his family. In lighter news, Denise Sides, at 71 years old, was chosen to appear in Taylor Swift’s new music video, showing that opportunities in entertainment can come at any age.</p>
<p>Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company during a landmark trial focused on social media addiction. He expressed regret about not acting sooner to identify users under the age of 13, highlighting the ongoing debate about technology and youth protection.</p>
<p>Lastly, Air Force One and other aircraft used by high-level officials are set to receive a new paint job featuring colors preferred by Donald Trump. This change reflects how political leaders sometimes leave their mark on national symbols.</p>
