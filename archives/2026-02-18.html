    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 18, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The leader of the United States urged the United Kingdom not to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. He said such a move "will be a blight on our great ally," emphasizing the importance of maintaining control over the islands. This highlights ongoing tensions regarding territorial claims and alliances in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turkey's president publicly opposed Israel's recent recognition of Somaliland during an official visit to Ethiopia. He warned that this recognition could destabilize an already volatile region, reflecting concerns about the geopolitical impact of recognizing new or disputed states.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine concluded after just two hours on the second day, with no breakthrough achieved. The brief and difficult negotiations underscore the continuing challenges in resolving the conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>In Iran, a serious incident occurred at a cemetery during a commemoration for victims of the government’s crackdown on protesters. An Iranian security official appeared to fire on the crowd. This event points to ongoing unrest and the tense domestic political situation in Iran.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Crime</h2>
<p>At least 30 miners are believed to have died due to a suspected carbon-monoxide leak in Nigeria. The gas reportedly built up in poorly ventilated tunnels, causing workers to collapse. This tragedy draws attention to the dangerous conditions faced by miners and highlights the need for improved safety measures.</p>
<p>In France, authorities arrested 11 people in connection with the killing of Quentin Deranque, a far-right student activist. The wave of arrests is adding pressure on far-left groups, indicating heightened political tensions and ongoing investigations related to this politically charged crime.</p>
<p>In Spain, police detained a 20-year-old accused of defrauding a luxury hotel in Madrid of more than €20,000 by exploiting an online payment system. The suspect manipulated the system to book rooms for just one cent, exposing vulnerabilities in digital transactions within the hospitality industry.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Media</h2>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, defended the company in a landmark trial concerning social media addiction. The trial questions whether Instagram, owned by Meta, has harmful effects on children. Zuckerberg’s testimony is part of broader scrutiny over social media’s impact on youth mental health and safety.</p>
<h2>Culture and Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Denise Sides, a 71-year-old dancer, was cast in a music video for Taylor Swift's song "Opalite." Selected from hundreds of applicants, her involvement demonstrates that age is not a barrier in the creative arts and entertainment industry. This story offers a positive example of inclusion and opportunity for older adults in popular culture.</p>
<h2>U.S. Presidential Aircraft</h2>
<p>The Air Force One fleet and other aircraft serving high-level U.S. officials are set for a repainting using colors preferred by the U.S. president. This makeover reflects a change in the visual identity of official transportation and may symbolize a new era or administration aesthetic.</p>
