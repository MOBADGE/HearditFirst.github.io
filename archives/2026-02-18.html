Such accounts highlight the severe human rights abuses occurring and may affect sectarian tensions in the region going forward.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Peace Talks Show Cautious Optimism</h2>
<p>Talks aimed at resolving the conflict in Ukraine entered a second day in Geneva. The US special envoy reported "meaningful progress," though a major breakthrough is still uncertain. Continued negotiations suggest a willingness to seek peace, but the road ahead remains challenging.</p>
<h2>Avalanche in California Puts Skiers at Risk</h2>
<p>Rescuers are urgently searching for 10 skiers missing after an avalanche struck in California. The area experienced about 30 inches (76 cm) of new snow in the past 24 hours, likely contributing to hazardous conditions. This incident underscores the dangers faced in mountainous winter environments and the ongoing efforts of emergency teams.</p>

He is the third consecutive leader removed from office and the country's seventh since 2016, signaling persistent political instability. This turnover raises questions about governance and the potential impact on Peru’s future political landscape.</p>
<h2>Philippine Vice President Announces 2028 Presidential Bid</h2>
