    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks End Without Progress</h2>
<p>The second day of peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia concluded after only two hours without any breakthroughs. Details on specific topics discussed were not provided, but the brief session highlights the ongoing challenges in reaching an agreement. The stalled talks suggest that diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict may remain difficult in the near term.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Syria’s Alawite Minority</h2>
<p>BBC reports share distressing testimonies from women in Syria’s Alawite minority, describing kidnappings and sexual assaults. These attacks appear targeted at members of the sect linked to former President Assad. The accounts underscore continuing violence and sectarian tensions in the region, raising concerns about the protection of vulnerable groups amid the country’s complex conflict.</p>
<h2>Rescue Efforts After California Avalanche</h2>
<p>Search and rescue teams are urgently looking for nine skiers missing following an avalanche in California. The area experienced about 30 inches (76cm) of snowfall over 24 hours, contributing to hazardous mountain conditions. Authorities are focusing efforts on locating those trapped or buried, although the scale of snowfall complicates rescue operations.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Peru and the Philippines</h2>
<p>Peru’s Congress has removed President José Jerí after just four months in office. He is the third consecutive Peruvian president to be ousted and marks the country’s seventh leader removed since 2016, reflecting ongoing political instability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte announced she will run for president in 2028. Duterte, daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has had a public feud with the current president, Bongbong Marcos. Her candidacy sets the stage for continued competitive politics ahead of the next election.</p>
<h2>Additional News Highlights</h2>
<p>In Australia, one citizen was temporarily banned from returning after trying to leave an IS camp in Syria, among 34 people attempting to return home this week. Meanwhile, a professor at an Indian university faced backlash for claiming a Chinese-made robotic dog as the university’s own creation during an AI summit, drawing criticism for misrepresentation.</p>
<p>In the United States, CBS is accused by comedian Stephen Colbert of spiking an interview with a Texas Democrat due to concerns about the Federal Communications Commission’s possible reaction. CBS denies canceling the segment but acknowledged it could risk regulatory issues.</p>
<p>A tragic event occurred in Rhode Island where Robert Dorgan, also known as Roberta Esposito, was found dead inside a hockey arena. Dorgan is believed to have killed their ex-wife and son prior to their death, adding to a series of local violent incidents.</p>
<p>Lastly, a climber is on trial in Austria accused of leaving his girlfriend unprotected and exhausted near the summit of the country's highest mountain during a blizzard, which raises questions about responsibility and safety in high-risk mountain expeditions.</p>
