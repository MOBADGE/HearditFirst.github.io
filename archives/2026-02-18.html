    <h2>Natural Disaster in California</h2>
<p>A massive avalanche struck the Lake Tahoe region in California, resulting in the deaths of eight skiers. Fifteen people went missing on Tuesday, with one person still unaccounted for but presumed dead. Rescue and recovery efforts are ongoing in the area, highlighting the risks posed by winter conditions in mountainous regions.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The United States recently voiced official support for the United Kingdom’s Chagos Islands deal, a topic that remains sensitive. However, the US president publicly urged the UK not to give up control of Diego Garcia, one of the islands, reflecting tensions around this arrangement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, peace talks between Russia and Ukraine concluded after just two hours on the second day without making substantial progress. The brief negotiations were described as difficult, underscoring continuing challenges in resolving the conflict.</p>
<h2>Security Incident in Iran</h2>
<p>A security official in Iran reportedly opened fire on a crowd gathered at a cemetery. The gathering was a commemoration for victims of the government’s crackdown on protesters. This incident highlights ongoing political tensions within the country related to dissent and government response.</p>
<h2>Mining Tragedy in Nigeria</h2>
<p>At least 30 miners died in Nigeria due to a suspected carbon-monoxide leak in poorly ventilated tunnels. Witness accounts suggest that gas buildup caused the workers to collapse, bringing attention to hazardous working conditions in mining operations.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues in the United States</h2>
<p>Billionaire Les Wexner testified before US lawmakers that he was "naive" and "conned" by Jeffrey Epstein, accusing Epstein of stealing significant sums of money from his family. The hearing sheds light on Epstein’s financial dealings and Wexner’s involvement.</p>
<p>Separately, Mark Zuckerberg defended Meta during a landmark trial focused on allegations that Instagram can harm children by promoting addiction. His testimony is part of a broader legal examination of social media’s impact on youth.</p>
<h2>Culture and Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Denise Sides, a 71-year-old dancer, was selected from hundreds of applicants to feature in the music video for Taylor Swift’s song "Opalite." Her casting is an example of inclusive representation, showing that age is not a barrier in the entertainment industry.</p>
<h2>Aviation Update</h2>
<p>Air Force One, the presidential aircraft, is set for a repainting that will introduce new colors. The makeover aligns with preferences expressed by former US president Donald Trump and will also affect other aircraft used by high-level officials.</p>
<h2>Regional Tensions in Africa and the Middle East</h2>
<p>During an official visit to Ethiopia, Turkey's president criticized Israel’s recent recognition of Somaliland. He stated that this recognition could destabilize an already volatile region, reflecting ongoing geopolitical sensitivities in the Horn of Africa.</p>
