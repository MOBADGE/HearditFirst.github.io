<p>Meanwhile, in France, eleven people have been detained in connection with the killing of far-right student activist Quentin Deranque. The arrests come amid increased pressure on far-left groups suspected of involvement, pointing to heightened political tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Rescue Efforts</h2>

<p>Separately, in California, rescuers continue searching for nine skiers missing after an avalanche. Authorities warn that ongoing heavy snowfall is expected, which could hamper rescue efforts in the coming days as weather conditions remain hazardous.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Issues</h2>
