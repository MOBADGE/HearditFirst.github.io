    <h2>Ukraine Peace Talks Progress</h2>
<p>Talks between Ukraine and Russia entered their second day in Geneva, with the US special envoy describing "meaningful progress" after the first day. While the mood was optimistic, expectations for a major breakthrough remain low. These ongoing discussions are closely watched as they relate to efforts to resolve the conflict and establish lasting peace.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Syria</h2>
<p>Women from Syria’s Alawite minority have shared distressing experiences of being kidnapped and sexually assaulted, according to BBC reports. These attacks appear to target this particular religious sect associated with former President Assad. The accounts shed light on the continuing human rights abuses amid the broader Syrian conflict.</p>
<h2>Avalanche Search in California</h2>
<p>Rescue teams are urgently searching for nine skiers missing after an avalanche in California. The area has received about 30 inches (76 cm) of snow in the past 24 hours, complicating rescue efforts. The ongoing search highlights the dangers faced by winter sports enthusiasts in avalanche-prone regions.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Peru and the Philippines</h2>
<p>Peru’s Congress has voted to remove President José Jerí, who had been in office for just four months. He is the third president ousted in a row and the country's seventh since 2016, indicating ongoing political instability. In the Philippines, Vice-President Sara Duterte announced her intention to run for president in the 2028 election. She has notably had conflicts with the current administration led by Bongbong Marcos, adding a new dynamic to the country’s political landscape.</p>
<h2>Other News Briefs</h2>
<p>Australian authorities temporarily banned a citizen from returning from an IS camp in Syria. The individual is one of 34 people who recently tried to leave the camp for Australia. In Rhode Island, Robert Dorgan—also known as Roberta Esposito—was found dead inside an ice hockey arena where he is suspected of having killed his ex-wife and son.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, police investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie reported no DNA matches on a glove found at the scene but remain hopeful about locating the missing woman. In Austria, a climber is on trial accused of leaving his girlfriend unprotected near the summit of the country’s highest mountain during a blizzard, leading to her death.</p>
<p>Finally, US comedian Stephen Colbert claimed that CBS spiked an interview with a Texas Democrat over concerns related to the Federal Communications Commission. The network denies blocking the interview but acknowledged worries about regulatory issues.</p>
