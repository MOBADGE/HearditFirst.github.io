    <div class="date">February 18, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia concluded on their second day after only two hours, ending without any breakthroughs. The brief session underscored the challenging nature of negotiations amid the ongoing conflict, with both sides yet to agree on key issues.</p>
<p>In Peru, Congress has removed President José Jerí from office after just four months. He is the third president in a row to be ousted and the country's seventh since 2016, reflecting ongoing political instability in the nation.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, Vice President Sara Duterte announced her intention to run for president in the 2028 election. She is the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte and has had a public feud with the current president, Bongbong Marcos.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Syria</h2>
<p>The BBC has reported distressing accounts from women of Syria’s Alawite minority, a sect associated with former President Assad. They described experiences of kidnapping and rape, suggesting these assaults are targeted against their community. These reports highlight the continuing human rights challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Crime and Public Safety</h2>
<p>In Rhode Island, Robert Dorgan, also known as Roberta Esposito, was found dead inside the Pawtucket ice hockey arena. Dorgan is suspected of killing his ex-wife and son before the incident at the arena, raising concerns about domestic violence and public safety.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Emergencies</h2>
<p>In California, rescuers are urgently searching for nine skiers missing after a recent avalanche. The area received approximately 30 inches (76cm) of snowfall in 24 hours, which likely contributed to the avalanche and heightened risks for outdoor activities.</p>
<h2>Education and Innovation</h2>
<p>An Indian university is facing criticism after a professor claimed that a robotic dog developed by the Chinese company Unitree was made by the university itself. This claim has sparked backlash over academic honesty and representation at an artificial intelligence summit.</p>
