    <div class="date">February 18, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Talks between Ukraine and Russia entered their second day in Geneva, with the US special envoy describing "meaningful progress" made during the first day. Despite the optimistic tone from the US, hopes remain low for a major breakthrough in the negotiations. The talks aim to address ongoing conflict issues, and any progress could influence regional stability, though the path ahead looks challenging.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns in Syria</h2>
<p>Women from the Alawite minority in Syria have shared harrowing accounts of kidnapping and rape, with reports suggesting these assaults are targeted against the sect associated with former President Assad. These testimonies highlight continuing violence and sectarian tensions affecting vulnerable communities amid Syria’s prolonged instability.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Rescue Efforts</h2>
<p>In California, rescuers are urgently searching for nine skiers missing after an avalanche in an area that received approximately 30 inches (76 cm) of snowfall in the past 24 hours. The heavy snowfall and harsh conditions have complicated rescue efforts, underscoring risks for outdoor enthusiasts in mountainous regions during winter.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime News</h2>
<p>A man is currently on trial in Austria accused of leaving his girlfriend, Kerstin G, unprotected and exhausted near the summit of the country’s highest mountain during a blizzard, which reportedly led to her death. This case has drawn attention to responsibilities and risks associated with high-altitude climbing.</p>
<p>In the United States, Robert Dorgan, also known as Roberta Esposito, was found dead inside an ice hockey arena in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Dorgan was a suspect in a shooting incident that resulted in the deaths of his ex-wife and son, adding a tragic dimension to the case.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>Peru’s Congress has ousted President José Jerí after just four months in power, making him the third consecutive president removed and the country’s seventh since 2016. This ongoing political instability raises concerns about governance and democratic processes in Peru.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, Vice President Sara Duterte, daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has announced her intention to run for president in 2028. Notably, she has had a public feud with the current president, Bongbong Marcos, indicating possible political rivalry ahead of the election.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>Australia has temporarily banned a citizen who attempted to return from an Islamic State camp in Syria. This individual was among a group of 34 people who tried to leave the camp aiming to return to Australia, reflecting ongoing challenges related to repatriation from conflict zones.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, police investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie reported that no DNA matches have been found on a glove recovered in connection with the case. The sheriff expressed confidence that they will find her, regardless of how long the search takes.</p>
<p>Finally, Stephen Colbert alleged that CBS decided not to air an interview with a Texas Democrat due to fears of violating regulations by the US broadcast media watchdog, the FCC. The network denied these claims but acknowledged concerns about regulatory compliance.</p>
