    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks Stall</h2>
<p>The recent peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine concluded after only two hours without making any progress. This second day of talks was described as “difficult,” highlighting the ongoing challenges in reaching a resolution to the conflict. The lack of advancement suggests that tensions remain high and that further diplomatic efforts will be needed to move closer to peace.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Syria</h2>
<p>Women from Syria’s Alawite minority, associated with the former President Assad’s sect, have shared distressing accounts of kidnapping and sexual assault. These reports indicate that attacks may be deliberately targeting this specific community amid Syria’s broader conflict. These testimonies shed light on ongoing human rights abuses within the country, raising concerns about the safety and protection of vulnerable groups.</p>
<h2>Turkey Opposes Israel’s Recognition of Somaliland</h2>
<p>During an official visit to Ethiopia, Turkey’s president expressed strong opposition to Israel’s recent recognition of Somaliland. He warned that the move could destabilize an already volatile region, implying potential risks for regional security and diplomatic relations. This stance reflects the tension between different countries over recognition and support for Somaliland’s status.</p>
<h2>Avalanche in California: Search Underway for Missing Skiers</h2>
<p>Rescue teams are searching for nine skiers missing after an avalanche in California. Forecasters predict continued heavy snowfall in the area over the coming days, complicating rescue operations and increasing the danger for those involved. Authorities are closely monitoring the weather while efforts continue to locate those trapped or injured in the snow.</p>
<h2>Trial Opens Over Death on Austria’s Highest Mountain</h2>
<p>A man is on trial in Austria facing accusations related to the death of his girlfriend during a climb on the country’s highest mountain. He is alleged to have left her unprotected and exhausted in near-summit conditions during a blizzard. The case has drawn attention to mountaineering risks and responsibilities, with the trial ongoing to determine accountability.</p>
<h2>Legal Action Linked to Killing of French Nationalist</h2>
<p>Authorities have detained eleven people in connection with the killing of far-right student activist Quentin Deranque. The arrests come amid heightened pressures on the far-left groups suspected of involvement. This development points to an intensifying crackdown as police pursue those responsible for the violence.</p>
