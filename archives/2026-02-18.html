    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 18, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The US president urged the UK not to hand over the Diego Garcia islands to Mauritius, calling such a move "a blight on our great ally." The islands have strategic importance, and the statement highlights tensions over their future control.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turkey's president expressed opposition to Israel's recognition of Somaliland during an official visit to Ethiopia. He warned that this recognition could destabilize an already volatile region, emphasizing the delicate balance of regional politics.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia ended after just two hours on their second day, with no progress reported. The brief talks reflect ongoing challenges in finding a resolution to the conflict, which continues to have significant humanitarian and geopolitical consequences.</p>
<h2>Security Incidents</h2>
<p>In Iran, a security official reportedly opened fire on a crowd gathered at a cemetery to commemorate victims of a government crackdown on protesters. This incident underlines the persistent tension and unrest within the country.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, at least 30 miners were killed due to a suspected carbon-monoxide leak in poorly ventilated tunnels. Witnesses say the toxic gas buildup caused the miners to collapse, highlighting ongoing safety issues in mining operations.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In the United States, Meta’s chief executive defended the company in a landmark trial examining whether Instagram contributes to addiction among children. The proceedings are closely watched as they could influence future regulation of social media platforms.</p>
<p>In France, authorities detained eleven people connected to the killing of far-right student activist Quentin Deranque. The arrests have intensified pressure on the far-left, suggesting a politically charged investigation.</p>
<h2>Culture and Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Denise Sides, aged 71, was selected from hundreds of applicants to dance in Taylor Swift’s new music video "Opalite." Her casting sends a message that age is no barrier to participating in high-profile creative projects.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>The presidential jet Air Force One, along with other aircraft used by senior US officials, is set for a repainting using paint colors favored by former President Trump. This update will give the fleet a new look ahead of upcoming official use.</p>
<p>In Spain, police arrested a 20-year-old suspected of scamming a luxury hotel in Madrid out of over €20,000 by manipulating the online payment system, booking rooms for just one cent. This case highlights ongoing challenges in combating fraud in the hospitality industry.</p>
