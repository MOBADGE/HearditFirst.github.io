    <h2>Violence in Pakistan</h2>
<p>A blast at a mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital, has killed more than 30 people and injured almost 170 others. The explosion happened during Friday prayers, a time when many worshippers were gathered inside. Officials are investigating the cause of the blast. This tragic event has once again raised concerns about security and safety in places of worship in the region.</p>
<h2>Diplomacy Between Iran and the US</h2>
<p>Iranian foreign minister Abbas Aragchi described recent talks with US representatives in Muscat, Oman, as a "good beginning." The discussions lasted for hours and took place despite the countries having significantly different starting positions. Both sides plan to continue consultations. This dialogue could be a step toward easing long-standing tensions between Iran and the United States, though much work remains.</p>
<h2>Attack on Russian Military Official</h2>
<p>Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, a senior figure in Russia’s main military staff, was shot multiple times in Moscow. Details of the attack have not been fully disclosed, but the event highlights continuing security concerns within Russia. The reasons behind the shooting and the investigation into the incident are expected to develop in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Privacy Concerns in China</h2>
<p>A couple staying at a hotel in Shenzhen, China, discovered that their private moments had been secretly filmed and broadcast online to thousands of viewers. The incident raises serious questions about privacy and security in hotels and other accommodations. It may prompt calls for stricter monitoring and regulations to protect guests from intrusive surveillance technologies.</p>
<h2>Arctic Interest: Greenland Consulates</h2>
<p>Canada and France plan to open new consulates in Greenland. Although the move was planned before former US President Donald Trump expressed interest in buying the Arctic island, the countries say it shows solidarity with the people living there. The Arctic region continues to attract global attention because of its strategic location and natural resources.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in the EU</h2>
<p>The European Union has told the social media platform TikTok to change its "addictive design" or face massive fines. TikTok has rejected the claims, calling them "categorically false and entirely meritless," and has said it plans to challenge the accusations. This dispute is part of broader concerns about how social media companies impact user well-being and the push for stricter regulations in the digital space.</p>
