    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 06, 2026</div>
    <h2>Security and Violence</h2>
<p>A senior Russian military figure, Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, was shot multiple times in Moscow. He holds a significant role in Russia's main military general staff. Meanwhile, in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, a blast during Friday prayers at a mosque resulted in more than 30 deaths and nearly 170 injuries. The incident has raised concerns over security and safety during religious gatherings in the region.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, described recent talks with the United States in Oman as having a "good beginning." The discussions ended after several hours, despite the two countries starting with notably different positions. This development signals the potential for continued diplomatic engagement between Iran and the US in the future.</p>
<h2>Legal and Historical Accountability</h2>
<p>A Nigerian court has ordered the United Kingdom to pay £420 million in compensation related to the 1949 killing of miners. The miners were shot during a strike for improved working conditions by colonial police forces made up of Nigerians and Europeans. The ruling highlights ongoing issues of colonial-era justice and reparations.</p>
<h2>Technology and Regulation</h2>
<p>The European Union has demanded that TikTok change what regulators describe as an "addictive design" or face substantial fines. TikTok has responded by stating it will challenge the accusations, calling them "categorically false and entirely meritless." This move underscores increasing regulatory scrutiny of social media platforms in Europe.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>In France, suspected Chinese spies were arrested in a quiet town near defence and aerospace sites. Intelligence experts suggest the region's strategic importance makes it a target for espionage activities.  
Canada and France plan to open consulates in Greenland; these moves were in the works before comments by former US President Donald Trump about wanting the Arctic island but are now interpreted as support for Greenlanders.  
In Australia, the Royal Australian Mint faced criticism over a new coin portrait of Queen Elizabeth II marking 100 years since her birth. The Mint has defended the design amid the debate.  
In the United States, Savannah Guthrie’s brother renewed a plea for proof that their mother, Nancy Guthrie, who is 84, is alive after she was reportedly abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona.  
Finally, a video posted by Donald Trump containing a racist clip depicting former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes was initially defended by the White House but later removed after bipartisan condemnation.</p>
