    <h2>Security Incident in Moscow</h2>
<p>A senior Russian military figure, Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, was shot several times in Moscow. Alexeyev holds a prominent position in the main directorate of Russia’s military general staff. Details about the incident, including motivations or suspects, have not been disclosed. This event raises concerns regarding security and stability within Russia’s military leadership.</p>
<h2>Iran and US Diplomatic Talks</h2>
<p>Iran's foreign ministry has described recent talks with the United States in Oman as a "good beginning." The discussions lasted several hours and started amid significant differences between the two countries. Both sides have agreed to continue negotiations, indicating a potential pathway toward resolving ongoing tensions. The talks could influence future diplomatic relations and regional stability.</p>
<h2>Deadly Blast in Pakistan</h2>
<p>An explosion occurred at a mosque in Islamabad during Friday prayers, resulting in more than 30 fatalities and about 170 injuries. The blast is one of the deadliest incidents in the Pakistani capital recently, exacerbating security concerns. Authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion. The tragic event highlights ongoing security challenges in the area.</p>
<h2>TikTok Faces EU Pressure Over Platform Design</h2>
<p>The European Union has warned TikTok to modify its platform design, accusing it of being "addictive," or face massive fines. TikTok has rejected the accusations, calling them "categorically false and entirely meritless," and stated plans to challenge the EU’s demands. This confrontation is part of growing regulatory scrutiny of social media platforms concerning user welfare and data protection.</p>
<h2>International Moves in the Arctic Region</h2>
<p>Canada and France have opened consulates in Greenland. While these actions were planned before former U.S. President Trump publicly expressed interest in acquiring the Arctic island, they are now seen as a demonstration of solidarity with Greenlanders. The increased international presence underlines Greenland’s strategic importance and growing geopolitical attention on the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>Legal Ruling on Colonial-Era Killing</h2>
<p>A Nigerian court has ordered the United Kingdom to pay £420 million in compensation related to a 1949 incident where colonial police killed striking miners. The police force included both Nigerians and Europeans, and the workers had been protesting for improved conditions. This decision represents a significant legal development addressing historical grievances stemming from colonial rule.</p>
