    <h2>Middle East Tensions and Diplomatic Talks</h2>
<p>The United States and Iran are preparing to begin talks amid ongoing concerns about the potential for direct conflict. The US has increased its military presence in the Middle East in response to Iran's violent crackdown on protests within its borders. These developments highlight rising tensions in the region, raising questions about how diplomatic efforts might prevent further escalation and what outcomes these talks could produce for regional stability.</p>
<h2>Security Incidents in Pakistan and Russia</h2>
<p>A deadly blast at a mosque in Pakistan has claimed more than 20 lives. Officials have not confirmed the cause but suspect a suicide bomber was responsible. This tragic incident adds to a history of violence affecting places of worship in the region. Meanwhile, in Russia’s capital, Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, a senior official in the main directorate of the military general staff, was shot multiple times. The circumstances of the attack have not been detailed, but it marks a significant security event involving a high-ranking military figure.</p>
<h2>Greenland Gains New Diplomatic Presence</h2>
<p>Canada and France have announced plans to open consulates in Greenland. These moves were already in the works before former US president Donald Trump expressed interest in the Arctic island. The consulates are seen as a gesture of solidarity with Greenlanders amidst increasing international attention on the region, reflecting growing geopolitical interest in the Arctic’s strategic and environmental significance.</p>
<h2>High-Profile Endorsement in Japan’s Election</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has publicly endorsed Hiroko Takaichi ahead of a snap election in Japan. This kind of direct involvement by a US president in foreign electoral politics is unusual. The endorsement may influence political dynamics in Japan leading up to the election and is likely to draw attention to the broader implications of foreign endorsements on national politics.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business Updates</h2>
<p>Amazon shares fell following the announcement that it will join other major tech firms in a collective investment spree of $650 billion in artificial intelligence this week. The spending surge on AI reflects growing industry competition but has caused some investor unease. In other business news, the jewellery brand Pandora plans to shift its focus from silver to platinum. This change aims to reduce costs amid rising prices for precious metals.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Authorities in the United States maintain hope that Nancy Guthrie, the missing mother of television personality Savannah Guthrie, is alive and can still be found. Guthrie’s family has recently made a second appeal for her safe return through video messages. Additionally, Daniel Andreas San Diego, a fugitive wanted by the FBI for 21 years, is to be extradited from Wales to the US. He was discovered hiding in a cottage in north Wales in 2024, ending a lengthy search.</p>
