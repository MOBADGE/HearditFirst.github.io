    <h2>Violence in Pakistan</h2>
<p>A deadly blast at a mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan, killed more than 30 people and injured nearly 170 others. The explosion occurred during Friday prayers, one of the busiest times at the mosque. Officials are investigating the cause of the blast. This tragic incident adds to concerns about security and stability in the region.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Talks Between Iran and the US</h2>
<p>Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, described recent talks with US officials in Oman as a “good beginning.” The discussions, held in Muscat, lasted several hours despite significant differences between the two sides. Both countries plan to hold further consultations soon. These talks could mark a step toward easing tensions and improving diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>Violence in Russia</h2>
<p>Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, a high-ranking officer in Russia’s military general staff, was shot several times in Moscow. Details about the motive or suspects have not yet been released. The incident highlights ongoing security challenges within Russia’s capital.</p>
<h2>Concerns Over Missing Woman in the US</h2>
<p>Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of NBC News presenter Savannah Guthrie, is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona. Savannah’s brother has renewed public appeals for information or proof that she is alive. Authorities are continuing their investigations into her disappearance.</p>
<h2>International Relations in the Arctic</h2>
<p>Canada and France are planning to open consulates in Greenland. These moves were already in progress but are now seen as demonstrating support for Greenlanders, following recent comments by former US President Trump expressing interest in acquiring the Arctic island. The new consulates could strengthen diplomatic ties and cooperation in the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Europe</h2>
<p>The European Union has ordered TikTok to change its "addictive design" or face substantial fines. TikTok has denied the accusations, labeling them as "categorically false and entirely meritless," and intends to challenge the EU’s demands. The case reflects ongoing efforts by regulators to address concerns about user mental health and data privacy on social media platforms.</p>
