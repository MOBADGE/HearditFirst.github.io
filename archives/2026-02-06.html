    <h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Talks between the United States and Iran have concluded in Oman with what Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi called a "good beginning." The discussions lasted several hours, despite the countries starting from very different positions. The continuation of these talks suggests an ongoing diplomatic effort to address tensions and potentially improve relations between the two nations.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Japan</h2>
<p>Japan is preparing for a snap election on Sunday, seen as a significant test for Sanae Takaichi, the country's first female premier. While Takaichi remains popular with voters, her leadership faces challenges from rising inflation and a recent diplomatic dispute with China. The election outcomes will be closely watched for indications of public support amid these economic and international issues.</p>
<h2>Security Incidents and Espionage</h2>
<p>Moscow experienced a violent attack when Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, a senior figure in Russia’s military general staff, was shot multiple times. This event highlights ongoing security concerns within Russia. Separately, in southwestern France, suspected Chinese spies were arrested in a quiet town near key defence and aerospace facilities, underscoring the region's vulnerability to espionage activities.</p>
<h2>Human Interest Stories from Conflict Zones</h2>
<p>A Ukrainian family experienced emotional relief after hearing from Nazar Daletskyi, a soldier they believed had died in 2023; they had even buried what they thought was his body. Additionally, inside the Gaza Strip, people returning through the Rafah crossing reported being searched by a Palestinian militia linked to Israel. These stories shed light on the personal and security challenges faced by civilians in conflict-affected areas.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Zambia, a fisherman who fled from a herd of elephants was tragically killed by a crocodile while seeking safety in a river. In Australia, the Royal Australian Mint faced criticism over the design of a coin commemorating 100 years since Queen Elizabeth II's birth but defended the artwork. Also, a Nigerian court has ordered the UK to pay £420 million in compensation related to the 1949 killing of striking miners by colonial police, reflecting ongoing legal reckonings with historical injustices.</p>
