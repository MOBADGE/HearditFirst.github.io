    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 06, 2026</div>
    <h2>Security and Conflict Updates</h2>
<p>A deadly blast at a mosque in Pakistan has killed more than 30 people. Officials have not confirmed the cause of the explosion, but reports suggest it was carried out by a suicide bomber. This attack adds to ongoing regional instability and raises concerns about security at religious sites.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, tensions between the US and Iran remain high. The US has increased its military presence in the region in response to Iran's violent crackdown on protests. Talks between the US and Iran are ongoing amidst fears of a direct conflict, underscoring the fragile state of diplomacy in the area.</p>
<p>A senior Russian military figure, Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, was shot several times in Moscow. He is linked to the main directorate of Russia's military general staff. The circumstances and motive behind the shooting have not been detailed, but the incident highlights security challenges within Russia.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Canada and France have announced plans to open consulates in Greenland. These moves were planned before former US President Trump publicly expressed interest in acquiring the Arctic island but are now seen as gestures of solidarity with Greenlanders. The development points to increasing international attention on the Arctic region and its strategic importance.</p>
<p>In an unusual move, former US President Trump has publicly endorsed Japan's Takaichi ahead of a snap election in Japan. Such direct involvement by a US political figure in a foreign election is rare, indicating a possible shift in diplomatic engagement tactics.</p>
<h2>Technology and Privacy Concerns</h2>
<p>TikTok faces pressure from the European Union to change what regulators call its "addictive design." The EU has warned of massive fines if the platform does not comply. TikTok has announced plans to challenge these claims, calling them "categorically false and entirely meritless." This dispute highlights ongoing concerns about social media's impact on user behavior and regulatory attempts to address it.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Crime</h2>
<p>In China, a couple who stayed at a hotel in Shenzhen discovered that their private moments had been secretly filmed and broadcast to thousands online via spy cameras. This incident raises issues about privacy violations and the use of covert surveillance in hospitality settings.</p>
<p>In Zambia, a fisherman who was fleeing from a herd of elephants ran into a stream for safety but was killed by a crocodile. The tragic event underlines the dangers people face in areas where human and wildlife habitats intersect.</p>
<p>In the United States, police continue to search for Nancy Guthrie, the mother of television host Savannah Guthrie, who is missing. Her family has released a second video message this week appealing for her safe return, emphasizing the ongoing concern and efforts to locate her.</p>
<h2>Culture and Public Reactions</h2>
<p>The Royal Australian Mint has released coins featuring a portrait of the late Queen Elizabeth II to mark 100 years since her birth. The design has drawn criticism, although the mint has defended it. This reflects diverse public opinions on commemorating historical figures through currency design.</p>
