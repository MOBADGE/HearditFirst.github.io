    <h2>Security Incident in Moscow</h2>
<p>A senior Russian military figure, Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, was shot multiple times in Moscow. He holds a high-ranking role in Russia's military general staff. The details surrounding the shooting, including motives and suspects, have not been disclosed so far. This incident raises concerns about security within Russia’s military circles.</p>
<h2>Iran-U.S. Diplomatic Talks</h2>
<p>Iranian Foreign Ministry official Abbas Aragchi described recent discussions with U.S. representatives in Oman as a "good beginning." The talks, held over several hours in Muscat, involved both sides approaching the dialogue with significantly different positions. Further consultations are planned, signaling cautious but ongoing diplomatic engagement between Iran and the U.S.</p>
<h2>Mosque Blast in Pakistan Kills Over 30</h2>
<p>A bombing at a mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan, during Friday prayers resulted in the deaths of more than 30 people and injured nearly 170 others. The attack targeted worshippers in the capital, causing widespread shock. Authorities are investigating the incident, which adds to ongoing concerns about security and violence in the region.</p>
<h2>Controversy Over Video Removed by Trump</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump removed a video that featured a racist clip showing President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama depicted as apes. The clip drew sharp criticism, including from a Black Republican senator who called it the most racist thing seen from the administration. Trump’s team dismissed the backlash as "fake outrage," highlighting ongoing tensions over race and political messaging.</p>
<h2>International Moves on Greenland</h2>
<p>Canada and France announced plans to open consulates in Greenland. Though these initiatives were in progress before Donald Trump expressed interest in the Arctic island, they are being interpreted as a gesture of support for the people of Greenland. The new consulates are expected to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties in the strategically important Arctic region.</p>
<h2>EU Challenges TikTok Over User Interface</h2>
<p>The European Union has ordered TikTok to change features of its app that it says make the platform "addictive." The EU warned that failure to comply could result in significant fines. TikTok has responded by disputing the accusations, calling them "categorically false and entirely meritless," and plans to challenge the EU's demands. This highlights growing regulatory scrutiny of social media companies regarding user well-being.</p>
