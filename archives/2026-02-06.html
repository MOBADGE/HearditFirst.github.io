    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 06, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Sports</h2>
<p>The 2026 Winter Olympics have officially started with an opening ceremony in Milan-Cortina. The event featured performances by well-known singers Andrea Bocelli and Mariah Carey. The ceremony set a vibrant tone for the games, which will showcase winter sports talents from around the world.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Japan</h2>
<p>Japan is preparing for a snap election amid various challenges. Sanae Takaichi, the country's first female premier, is popular with voters. However, concerns remain over inflation and a diplomatic dispute with China. The election's outcome could impact Japan's domestic policies and its international relations.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict Updates</h2>
<p>In Moscow, a high-ranking military official, Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, was shot multiple times. He is a senior figure within Russia’s military general staff. The circumstances of the shooting and its implications for Russia’s military leadership are still unfolding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Gaza, people returning through the Rafah crossing reported inspections by a Palestinian militia linked to Israel. One woman described searches of individuals and their belongings at an Israeli checkpoint inside Gaza, highlighting ongoing security tensions in the area.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Talks between the United States and Iran have concluded in Oman with what Iran's foreign minister Abbas Aragchi described as a "good beginning." Although the two countries entered the discussions with notably different views, the continuation of talks suggests an effort to find common ground on key issues.</p>
<h2>Legal and Security Issues in Europe and Africa</h2>
<p>In a French town, suspected Chinese spies were arrested due to concerns over espionage activities linked to the area's proximity to defence and aerospace sites. Intelligence experts believe this location is strategically important, making it a target for spying.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, a court ordered the United Kingdom to pay £420 million in compensation related to a 1949 incident where colonial police shot striking miners demanding better working conditions. This ruling reflects ongoing efforts to address historical grievances dating back to the colonial era.</p>
<h2>Consumer and Technology News</h2>
<p>The European Union has directed TikTok to change features considered to be "addictive" or face substantial fines. TikTok has strongly rejected the claims, describing them as "categorically false and entirely meritless," and plans to challenge the EU's demands. The situation highlights growing scrutiny over social media platform designs and their impact on users.</p>
