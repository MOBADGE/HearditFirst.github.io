    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A major fire has broken out in residential tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 36 deaths and hundreds of people missing. Firefighters have been working to control the blaze but have not yet been able to fully contain it. The situation remains critical as locals anxiously await news about loved ones who have not been located. Emergency services are continuing their efforts despite the challenging conditions.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>In the US, the president defended Witkoff following the leak of an audio recording that appears to show an envoy coaching Russia during negotiations. Although the president stated he had not heard the audio, he described the content as resembling "standard" negotiations. Meanwhile, the last remaining criminal case against the president related to the 2020 election interference was dismissed by a Georgia judge, marking a significant development in ongoing legal matters. The Trump administration is also reportedly engaged in serious diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a peace deal in Ukraine despite appearing chaotic.</p>
<h2>Military Coup in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>Guinea-Bissau experienced a sudden military takeover ahead of the announcement of recent election results. Soldiers seized power and detained the country’s president, creating a tense political situation. The coup interrupts the democratic process and could lead to uncertainty about the nation's stability and future governance.</p>
<h2>Legal News from France</h2>
<p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy had a conviction for illegal campaign financing upheld. He was sentenced to six months in prison while being allowed to serve it under electronic monitoring, with an additional six months suspended. This ruling closes another chapter in the legal challenges faced by Sarkozy linked to his time in office.</p>
<h2>Social Media Law Challenge in Australia</h2>
<p>A group of teenagers has launched a legal challenge in Australia’s High Court against a new social media law. The law aims to block users under 16 from holding social media accounts, but the teens argue that the restriction is unconstitutional. The challenge raises questions about youth digital rights and government regulation of social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Incident on Chicago Train</h2>
<p>A disturbing incident occurred on a Chicago train where a man, who has a history of 72 prior arrests, is accused of dousing a fellow passenger with gasoline and setting her on fire. The victim was reportedly using her phone at the time of the attack. The case highlights concerns about public safety and the handling of repeat offenders in the city.</p>
