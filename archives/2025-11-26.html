    <h2>Major Fire in Hong Kong High-Rises</h2>
<p>A large fire has engulfed tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 36 deaths. Firefighters continue to battle the blaze but have not yet been able to fully contain it. Hundreds of people remain missing as emergency efforts continue. The scale of the fire and challenges faced by responders highlight ongoing risks in densely populated urban areas and raise concerns about safety measures in high-rise residential buildings.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>In the US, a judge in Georgia dismissed the last remaining criminal case against the US president related to interference in the 2020 election. This decision removes the final state charges from election-related legal battles involving him. In a separate matter, the president defended Glenn Witkoff, after a leaked audio appeared to show the envoy coaching Russia during negotiations; he described the conversation as "standard" negotiations, although he had not heard the audio himself.</p>
<p>Additionally, the administration is continuing efforts toward a peace agreement in Ukraine. Despite reports of chaos surrounding the diplomacy, officials appear serious about reaching a deal to help end the conflict, signaling ongoing diplomatic engagement in the region.</p>
<h2>Military Takeover in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>In West Africa, soldiers in Guinea-Bissau have claimed to have taken power following reports that the country's president was arrested. This military action took place as the nation awaited election results from the recent vote held on Sunday. The situation underscores political instability in the country and may affect its democratic processes and international relations.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues Abroad</h2>
<p>In France, former president Nicolas Sarkozy will serve a six-month term wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet following the upholding of his illegal campaign financing conviction. He will also have an additional six months of a suspended sentence. This decision reflects ongoing scrutiny of political finance and accountability in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Australia, a group of teenagers has launched a High Court challenge against a new social media law that bans users under 16 from having social media accounts. They argue that the law is unconstitutional, bringing attention to debates around digital rights and youth access to social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Severe Flooding in Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Parts of Southeast Asia are experiencing deadly floods following what authorities describe as "once in 300 years" rainfall in a Thai city. About 2 million people have been affected by the floods, with many still cut off from assistance. The flooding is contributing to a humanitarian crisis in the region, emphasizing the urgent need for disaster response and infrastructure improvements to better manage extreme weather events.</p>
