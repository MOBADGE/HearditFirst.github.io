    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A severe fire has engulfed several apartment towers in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 36 confirmed deaths. Firefighters remain on the scene, actively working to control the blaze, but they have not indicated when the fire might be fully contained. The death toll is expected to rise, and hundreds of residents are reported missing amid ongoing rescue efforts. Locals are anxiously awaiting updates on missing family members as emergency teams continue their response.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>The legal landscape around former US president Donald Trump saw a significant change when a Georgia judge dismissed the state's last criminal case against him connected to the 2020 election. Meanwhile, Trump defended an individual named Witkoff following the leak of an audio recording, which appeared to show coaching of Russia. Trump stated he had not heard the recording but suggested it resembled typical negotiation tactics. On the international stage, the Trump administration appears committed to pursuing a peace deal in Ukraine despite reports of internal confusion surrounding the diplomatic process.</p>
<h2>Military Coup in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>Guinea-Bissau experienced a sudden military takeover as soldiers seized power and detained the country's president. This coup occurred while the West African nation awaited election results from a recent vote, adding uncertainty to the country's political future. The impact of this takeover on the region and subsequent political developments remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Legal Case Against Nicolas Sarkozy</h2>
<p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has had his conviction for illegal campaign financing upheld. He is set to serve a six-month prison term, which will be carried out with an electronic monitoring bracelet. Additionally, he faces another six-month suspended sentence. This ruling marks a notable conclusion to a high-profile case involving a prominent political figure.</p>
<h2>Social Media Age Restrictions in Australia</h2>
<p>A group of teenagers in Australia has launched a challenge at the High Court against a new social media law. The law would prevent users under the age of 16 from having social media accounts. The teens argue that this legislation is unconstitutional, but the case will determine whether the government’s age-based restrictions on social media use will stand.</p>
<h2>Violent Incident in Chicago</h2>
<p>In Chicago, a man accused of setting a fellow train passenger on fire has drawn attention due to his extensive criminal record. The suspect had 72 prior arrests before the incident, in which he allegedly doused a woman with gasoline while she was reading on her phone during a train ride. The case raises ongoing concerns about public safety and crime prevention in urban transit systems.</p>
