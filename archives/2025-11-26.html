    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A deadly fire has engulfed several tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 44 confirmed deaths with hundreds more reported missing. Firefighters are actively tackling the blaze but have not yet determined when the fire will be fully contained. The ongoing efforts are critical as residents anxiously wait for news about missing loved ones and the overall impact continues to grow. This tragedy highlights challenges in emergency response and urban safety in densely populated areas.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>In the US, significant legal and political events are unfolding. A Georgia judge dismissed the last remaining criminal case against the US president related to the 2020 election, marking a notable moment in his legal battles. Meanwhile, the US president defended an envoy amid controversy over leaked audio suggesting coaching in negotiations with Russia, describing it as "standard." In related diplomatic news, the administration appears committed to pursuing a peace deal in Ukraine despite apparent chaos in the negotiation process.</p>
<h2>Military Coup in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>In West Africa, the military in Guinea-Bissau has seized power and detained the president. This takeover occurred as the country awaited election results from Sunday’s vote, creating a significant political crisis. The situation adds to concerns about stability in the region and the potential impacts on governance and democratic processes.</p>
<h2>Legal Ruling in France</h2>
<p>In France, a court upheld the conviction of Nicolas Sarkozy for illegal campaign financing. The former president will serve a six-month sentence wearing an electronic bracelet and has an additional six months of suspended sentence. This ruling reinforces accountability for campaign conduct and has implications for political figures facing legal scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Social Media Restrictions in Australia</h2>
<p>A group of teenagers in Australia has launched a High Court challenge against a new social media law that prohibits users under 16 from creating accounts. They argue that the law is unconstitutional. The case may shape future regulations on digital access for younger users and raise questions about youth rights and online safety measures.</p>
<h2>Violent Incident on a Chicago Train</h2>
