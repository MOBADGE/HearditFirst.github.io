    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A large fire has engulfed residential tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 44 deaths. Hundreds of people remain missing as firefighters continue to battle the blaze. Fire crews have not yet been able to contain the fire fully and are unsure when they will succeed. The local community is deeply affected and anxiously awaiting news about missing relatives. The ongoing emergency response highlights the severity of the situation and the challenges involved in bringing the fire under control.</p>
<h2>US Political and Legal News</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump remains in the news amid several developments. A Georgia judge dismissed the last criminal case against him related to the 2020 election, removing remaining state charges. Meanwhile, Trump defended real estate figure Witkoff after a leaked audio clip suggested involvement with Russia. Trump described the conversation as normal negotiation tactics and said he had not heard the audio. In diplomatic efforts, the Trump administration is reportedly serious about negotiating peace in Ukraine despite disorganized appearances, indicating a possible shift toward reaching a deal.</p>
<h2>West African Military Coup</h2>
<p>In Guinea-Bissau, soldiers have seized power by detaining the sitting president. This military takeover occurred just as the country was awaiting election results from a recent vote held on Sunday. The situation signals political instability in the West African nation and raises uncertainty about the country's future governance and the resolution of the election process.</p>
<h2>France: Sarkozy's Campaign Finance Conviction Upheld</h2>
<p>A French court has upheld the conviction of Nicolas Sarkozy for illegal campaign financing. The former president will serve a six-month jail term but will be allowed to wear an electronic bracelet. Another six-month sentence is suspended. This decision finalizes the legal consequences for Sarkozy in the financing case and is notable given his former role in French politics.</p>
<h2>Australia: Teen Legal Challenge to Social Media Ban</h2>
<p>In Australia, teenagers are challenging a new social media law in the High Court. The law prohibits users under 16 from having social media accounts. The teens argue that the ban is unconstitutional. This case could have significant implications for youth access to social media and government authority over online platforms.</p>
<h2>Incident on Chicago Train</h2>
<p>In Chicago, a man with a history of 72 prior arrests is accused of setting a passenger on fire aboard a train. The victim was reportedly using her phone when the man allegedly poured gasoline on her and ignited it. Authorities have charged the accused as investigations continue into this disturbing incident.</p>
