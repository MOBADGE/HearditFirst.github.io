    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A major fire in Hong Kong has engulfed multiple tower blocks, resulting in at least 36 confirmed deaths. Firefighters are actively battling the blaze but have not been able to fully contain it, and the situation remains critical. Hundreds of people are still reported missing as rescue efforts continue amid growing concerns from local residents awaiting news of their loved ones. The scale and intensity of the fire have led to widespread devastation and heightened anxieties across the community.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>In the US, the president defended real estate developer Witkoff after a leaked audio appeared to show Witkoff coaching Russia during negotiations. The president stated he had not heard the recording but described it as sounding like "standard" negotiation tactics. Separately, a Georgia judge dismissed a criminal case against the president related to alleged interference in the 2020 election. This case was the last remaining state-level criminal charge against him stemming from the 2020 election.</p>
<h2>Coup in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>Soldiers in Guinea-Bissau have announced they have taken power amid reports that the country’s president was arrested. The military takeover occurred a day after the nation held elections, the results of which were still being awaited. This development marks a significant political crisis in the West African country with uncertain next steps for governance and stability.</p>
<h2>European Legal Update: Nicolas Sarkozy</h2>
<p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, has had his conviction for illegal campaign financing upheld. He will serve a six-month prison sentence under an electronic bracelet, followed by an additional six months suspended sentence. This ruling confirms the legal consequences faced by Sarkozy stemming from his campaign finance activities.</p>
<h2>Social Media Ban Challenge in Australia</h2>
<p>A group of teenagers has launched a High Court challenge against Australia’s new law that bans social media use for individuals under 16 years old. They claim the law is unconstitutional, arguing it unjustly restricts access to social media platforms for young users. The case will test the balance between government regulation of online spaces and constitutional rights.</p>
<h2>Incident on Chicago Train</h2>
<p>In Chicago, a man with a history of 72 prior arrests is accused of setting a fellow train passenger on fire. The incident occurred while the victim was reading on her phone. The accused allegedly doused her with gasoline, leading to a frightening event that has raised questions about public safety and the management of repeat offenders in the city.</p>
