    <h2>Deadly Fire in Hong Kong Tower Blocks</h2>
<p>A massive fire has engulfed multiple apartment blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 44 confirmed deaths. Hundreds of residents remain missing as firefighters continue to battle the blaze. Officials have expressed uncertainty about when the fire will be fully brought under control. Locals are in shock and waiting anxiously for news about missing family members amid ongoing rescue and containment efforts. The scale and severity of the fire highlight challenges in managing high-rise emergencies in densely populated cities.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>In the U.S., a judge in Georgia dismissed the last remaining criminal case against Donald Trump linked to alleged interference in the 2020 election. This ruling effectively ends state-level legal proceedings related to the election for him. Meanwhile, President Trump defended an envoy, Witkoff, following a leaked audio that appeared to show the envoy coaching Russia during negotiations. Trump said he had not heard the recording but described its content as “standard” negotiation tactics.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, the Trump administration is reportedly making efforts toward a peace deal related to ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Despite apparent organizational challenges and public chaos surrounding the negotiations, the administration is showing seriousness in reaching an agreement, which could have significant implications for the regional stability and international relations.</p>
<h2>Military Coup in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>Guinea-Bissau has experienced a major political upheaval as soldiers seized power and detained the president. The takeover occurred while the West African country was awaiting the results of a recent election held on Sunday. This sudden military intervention raises concerns about the future governance and stability of Guinea-Bissau and could affect the broader region's political dynamics.</p>
<h2>Legal News from France</h2>
<p>In France, a conviction for illegal campaign financing against Nicolas Sarkozy, a former president, was upheld. Sarkozy will serve a six-month jail term under electronic monitoring, with an additional six months suspended. This decision marks a significant development in France’s legal proceedings involving former political leaders and campaign finance accountability.</p>
<h2>Social Media Legislation Challenge in Australia</h2>
<p>A group of teenagers has launched a legal challenge in Australia's High Court against a new social media law that bans users under the age of 16 from maintaining accounts. The challenge argues that this legislation is unconstitutional. The case could have implications for youth rights, digital privacy, and government regulation of online platforms in Australia.</p>
<h2>Violent Attack on Chicago Train Passenger</h2>
<p>In Chicago, a man accused of setting a woman on fire on a train has a lengthy criminal history, with 72 prior arrests. The victim was reportedly using her phone when the suspect doused her with gasoline. The attack has raised concerns about public safety and violence on public transportation. Authorities continue to investigate the incident as they seek justice for the victim.</p>
