    <h2>Major Fire in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>A large fire has broken out in multiple tower blocks in Hong Kong, leaving at least 36 people dead. Firefighters are currently struggling to contain the blaze and have not been able to say when it will be fully under control. Hundreds of residents are still missing amid the ongoing emergency response. The situation remains critical as rescue efforts continue with uncertainty about the final impact.</p>
<h2>US Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, a judge in Georgia dismissed the last remaining criminal case related to the 2020 election interference involving Donald Trump. This ruling removes the final state-level legal challenge against him tied to that election.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Trump defended an envoy named Witkoff after a leaked audio tape appeared to reveal him coaching Russia during negotiations. Trump said he had not listened to the recording but described the content as "standard" negotiation activity.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Efforts on Ukraine Peace</h2>
<p>Despite a chaotic diplomatic environment, the Trump administration is reportedly serious about pursuing a peace deal in Ukraine. This comes amid ongoing international efforts to reduce tensions and bring stability to the region. The progress and outcomes of these negotiations remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>Political Instability in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>In Guinea-Bissau, soldiers have claimed to have taken control of the country following reports that the president was arrested. The military takeover occurred as the nation awaited the results of recent elections. This development raises concerns about the political future and stability of the West African country.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters in Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Unusually heavy rain, described as the heaviest in 300 years, has caused severe flooding in a Thai city and wider parts of Southeast Asia. The floods have affected around 2 million people, many of whom remain cut off from assistance. The disaster has prompted emergency responses amid worries about further impact on the population.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In France, former president Nicolas Sarkozy had his conviction for illegal campaign financing upheld. He will serve a six-month term equipped with an electronic bracelet, followed by an additional six months suspended.</p>
<p>In Australia, a group of teenagers is challenging a new law in the High Court that would ban social media accounts for users under 16 years old. The group argues the law is unconstitutional and infringes on rights to access online platforms.</p>
<p>Also in the US, a man in Chicago accused of setting a train passenger on fire had 72 previous arrests. The victim was reportedly attacked while reading her phone on a train, and the incident has drawn attention to public safety concerns on transit.</p>
