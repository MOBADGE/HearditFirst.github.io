    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A massive fire has engulfed a cluster of residential tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 36 deaths. Firefighters are still struggling to control the blaze and have not indicated when it might be fully contained. Hundreds of residents remain unaccounted for as officials and emergency crews continue their efforts. Local residents have expressed shock and devastation in response to the tragedy, awaiting news about missing loved ones as the fire remains active.</p>
<h2>U.S. Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, the last remaining criminal case linked to the 2020 election interference allegations against Donald Trump was dismissed by a judge in Georgia. This ruling means that no state charges are pending against Trump related to those allegations. Meanwhile, the U.S. president defended a figure named Witkoff after an audio leak suggested attempts to coach Russia during negotiations. The president described the content as sounding like "standard" negotiations, though he had not heard the audio recording himself.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Efforts on Ukraine Peace</h2>
<p>Diplomatic activities related to the conflict in Ukraine have continued amid reports of chaotic coordination. Despite apparent disorder, the administration led by Trump appears committed to reaching a peace agreement. The situation remains fluid, with ongoing negotiations seeking to find a resolution to the conflict.</p>
<h2>Military Coup in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>A military coup has occurred in Guinea-Bissau, where soldiers detained the sitting president. This takeover happened as the West African country was awaiting the results from a recent election held on Sunday. The political situation is uncertain as the military asserts control and the country's democratic process is interrupted.</p>
<h2>International Legal Sentence for Nicolas Sarkozy</h2>
<p>In France, a court has upheld a conviction against Nicolas Sarkozy for illegal campaign financing. The former French president will serve a six-month prison term monitored by an electronic bracelet, followed by another six months of suspended sentence. This decision reinforces accountability for campaign finance violations among high-profile political figures.</p>
<h2>Social Media Legal Challenge in Australia</h2>
<p>In Australia, a group of teenagers has launched a High Court challenge against a new law that will ban users under the age of 16 from having social media accounts. The challengers argue that this legislation is unconstitutional. This development highlights ongoing debates over the regulation of social media access among young people and the balance between protection and rights online.</p>
