    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A major fire has engulfed multiple tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 44 deaths and hundreds of people missing. Firefighters are currently working to control the blaze but have not yet been able to contain it. The situation remains critical as rescue efforts continue, and local residents await news about their loved ones. The cause of the fire has not been reported, and authorities are focusing on managing the ongoing emergency.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>Several key events have unfolded involving Donald Trump. A Georgia judge dismissed the last remaining criminal case against him related to the 2020 election, removing all active state-level election interference charges. At the same time, Trump defended a figure named Witkoff after an audio leak suggested coaching of Russia, describing the conversation as "standard" negotiations despite not having heard it himself. Additionally, the Trump administration appears to be actively pursuing a peace deal related to Ukraine, even amid confusion and chaotic appearances around its diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Military Coup in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>Guinea-Bissau has experienced a military takeover as soldiers seized power and detained the president. This occurred while the country was awaiting official results from its recent Sunday election. The move marks a significant disruption to the nation’s political process, and the situation is developing as the international community monitors the impact.</p>
<h2>Legal Rulings in France and Australia</h2>
<p>In France, a court has upheld the conviction of Nicolas Sarkozy for illegal campaign financing. Sarkozy will serve a six-month sentence with an electronic monitoring bracelet, along with an additional six months suspended. Meanwhile, in Australia, teenagers are challenging a new law that bans social media use for those under 16. They are taking the case to the High Court, arguing the law is unconstitutional. The outcome could affect digital access and regulation for young people.</p>
<h2>Crime in the United States</h2>
<p>In Chicago, a man accused of setting a fellow train passenger on fire had 72 prior arrests. The victim was reportedly using her phone on the train when the suspect doused her with gasoline. The incident has drawn attention due to the suspect's extensive criminal history and raises questions about public safety and law enforcement responses.</p>
