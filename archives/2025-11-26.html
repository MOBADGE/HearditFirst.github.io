    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A major fire has engulfed residential tower blocks in Hong Kong, killing at least 44 people and leaving hundreds more missing. Firefighters continue to battle the blaze but do not know when it will be fully controlled. The disaster has caused significant distress among local residents who are anxiously awaiting news of loved ones trapped in the flames. The situation remains critical as rescue efforts proceed amidst ongoing safety concerns.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>In West Africa, soldiers have seized power in Guinea-Bissau and detained the country's president. The takeover occurred while the nation was awaiting the outcome of Sunday’s election. This sudden military intervention has disrupted the democratic process and may lead to increased instability in the region. The international community will be watching closely to see how the situation develops and what steps might be taken to restore civilian governance.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political News from France and the US</h2>
<p>A French court upheld a conviction against Nicolas Sarkozy for illegal campaign financing. The former leader was sentenced to six months under electronic surveillance, with an additional six months suspended. Meanwhile, in the United States, a judge in Georgia dismissed the last remaining criminal case against Donald Trump related to alleged interference in the 2020 election. These rulings mark significant developments in ongoing legal battles for both political figures.</p>
<h2>US Diplomacy and Controversies</h2>
<p>The Trump administration appears committed to pursuing a peace agreement regarding Ukraine, despite a backdrop of chaotic diplomatic efforts. Additionally, President Trump defended a representative named Witkoff after a leaked audio clip suggested he was coaching Russia in negotiations. Trump described the exchange as sounding like "standard" diplomatic discussions, although he said he had not heard the recording himself.</p>
<h2>Social Media Law Challenge in Australia</h2>
<p>A group of teenagers in Australia has launched a High Court challenge against a new law that bars users under 16 from having social media accounts. They argue the legislation is unconstitutional, asserting it infringes on rights related to access and expression online. The case could have significant implications for social media regulation and youth rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Incident on Chicago Train</h2>
<p>In Chicago, a man accused of setting a fellow passenger on fire had 72 prior arrests. The victim was reportedly using her phone on the train when the man allegedly doused her with gasoline and ignited it. The incident has raised concerns about public safety and the management of repeat offenders in the city’s criminal justice system.</p>
