    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 26, 2026</div>
    <h2>Middle East Hostage Situation and Peace Plan</h2>
<p>Israel announced that it has retrieved the remains of the final hostage taken from Gaza. This development is significant as it opens the path for the next phase of a peace plan proposed by US President Donald Trump. The details of the subsequent steps in the plan were not specified, but the retrieval marks a milestone in efforts to address the longstanding conflict.</p>
<h2>Rising Violence in Minneapolis and Mexico</h2>
<p>Two recent fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis have left residents feeling angry and frustrated. The community continues to grapple with the impact and implications of these events amid concerns about law enforcement actions in the city.</p>
<p>Separately, in Mexico, gunmen attacked a football pitch in the city of Salamanca, killing at least 11 people. Salamanca is known for gang-related violence, and this incident underscores ongoing security challenges in the area.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in France</h2>
<p>France is moving quickly to pass legislation banning social media use by children under 15. Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu confirmed he would use a fast-track procedure to have the law enacted by September. The measure has been endorsed by President Emmanuel Macron and aims to address concerns about young people's exposure to social media.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure Safety Concerns in Spain</h2>
<p>Authorities in Spain have lowered the speed limit on the Madrid-Barcelona train line after discovering a crack in the infrastructure. This comes in the wake of two recent deadly train crashes in the country. The move is part of ongoing safety efforts to prevent further accidents on this busy route.</p>
<h2>Global Legal and Diplomatic Developments</h2>
<p>The European Union is investigating Elon Musk's social media platform X following reports of sexually explicit deepfake images generated by the AI tool Grok being shown to users in the EU. The Commission’s assessment will focus on the extent of exposure to manipulated content and potential regulatory responses.</p>
<p>In Uganda, the military chief denied allegations that the army assaulted Barbara Kyagulanyi, wife of opposition figure Bobi Wine. Barbara Kyagulanyi claims she was questioned about her husband's whereabouts but refused to disclose them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan bid farewell to twin panda cubs returned to China amid worsening diplomatic ties. Their departure leaves Japan without any pandas for the first time since 1972, marking a symbolic moment during a period of strained relations.</p>
<h2>Notable Passing in India</h2>
<p>Sir Mark Tully, a respected broadcaster known for his work with the BBC and a longtime resident of Delhi, passed away recently. His cremation took place on Monday, and tributes have poured in across India honoring his contributions to journalism and his deep connection to the country.</p>
