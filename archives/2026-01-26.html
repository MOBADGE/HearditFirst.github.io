    <h2>Hostage Return in Israel</h2>
<p>Israel has announced the retrieval of Ran Gvili, the last hostage held in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Gvili’s return as "an extraordinary achievement." This development may help ease some tensions after a period marked by hostage-taking, though the broader conflict remains unresolved.</p>
<h2>Violence and Public Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>Two recent deadly shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis have deeply affected the community. Residents voiced anger and frustration over the incidents, highlighting ongoing challenges related to policing and public safety in the city. These events have sparked renewed calls for accountability and reforms.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Nigeria</h2>
<p>Sixteen officers detained last year in Nigeria are now facing trial. They have been accused of plotting a coup to overthrow President Bola Tinubu, following an official investigation. This move is seen as an effort by Nigerian authorities to address security threats and maintain political stability.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Measures on Social Media in France</h2>
<p>France is moving forward with a plan to ban social media use for children under 15 years old. The legislation, supported by President Emmanuel Macron and pushed by Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu, is expected to be enacted by September through a fast-track procedure. The decision reflects concerns about young people's exposure to online content and digital wellbeing.</p>
<h2>Safety Concerns on Spanish Railways</h2>
<p>Spanish authorities have reduced the speed limit on the Madrid-Barcelona train route after finding a crack on the line. This safety measure follows two deadly train crashes in recent months and aims to prevent further accidents while investigations and repairs continue.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Mexico's Salamanca city, at least 11 people were killed when gunmen attacked a football match. The area has experienced significant gang-related violence, and this latest attack adds to ongoing security concerns.</p>
<p>In the United States, a private jet carrying eight people crashed in Maine amid poor visibility caused by a winter storm affecting much of the country.</p>
<p>In Uganda, military chief Denis Tanga denied allegations that the army assaulted Barbara Kyagulanyi, wife of opposition leader Bobi Wine. Barbara had reportedly refused to disclose her husband's location.</p>
<p>In the European Union, a formal investigation has been launched into Elon Musk's platform X over the distribution of manipulated sexually explicit images, linked to Grok AI technology, within the EU user base.</p>
<p>Finally, Japan has returned twin panda cubs to China amid deteriorating bilateral ties. This marks the first time since 1972 that Japan will not have any pandas in the country, a notable moment for cultural and diplomatic relations.</p>
