    <h2>Protests and Tensions in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Minneapolis has seen a wave of protests following two recent fatal shootings involving federal agents. The latest incident involved the shooting of Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse, which has been described by Governor Tim Walz as an "inflection point." Residents of the city are expressing anger and frustration after two people were killed by federal agents in recent weeks. The demonstrations have drawn attention to the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the area, with the governor urging then-President Trump to remove these agents from the city. The escalating unrest highlights ongoing tensions between community members and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<h2>Russia’s Alleged Misuse of Interpol</h2>
<p>A recent leak has revealed that Russia has been misusing Interpol’s wanted list to target critics living abroad. This represents the first time such extensive use of the international arrest system against political opponents has come to light. The information raises concerns about the potential abuse of international policing mechanisms for political purposes and the implications this has for individuals seeking safety outside Russia.</p>
<h2>Ferry Tragedy in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A tragic maritime incident occurred in the Philippines when the ferry MV Trisha Kerstin sank with approximately 300 passengers onboard. So far, 15 people have been confirmed dead, and the local coast guard continues to search for 28 passengers who remain missing. The accident has prompted rescue operations and raised safety concerns regarding ferry travel in the region.</p>
<h2>Heatwave Warning in Australia</h2>
<p>As millions across Australia celebrate their national day, parts of the country are bracing for a severe heatwave. Forecasts indicate that temperatures could reach the "high forties" Celsius in states such as Victoria and South Australia, with the peak expected on Tuesday. Authorities have issued heat warnings to help residents prepare for the extreme weather conditions, which could affect public health and safety during the celebrations.</p>
<h2>Pandas Return to China Amid Diplomatic Strains</h2>
<p>Japan has bid farewell to the twin panda cubs that were sent back to China, marking the first time since 1972 that Japan will have no pandas. This move comes amid worsening relations between the two countries. The departure of the pandas is a symbolic moment that reflects broader diplomatic challenges, with many in Japan feeling a sense of loss as the popular animals leave the country.</p>
