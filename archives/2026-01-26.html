    <h2>Protests and Tensions in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Minneapolis has seen widespread protests following the fatal shooting of intensive care nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents. This is the second recent deadly shooting in the city involving federal authorities, causing significant public anger and frustration. Governor Tim Walz described this incident as an "inflection point" and has urged the Trump administration to withdraw Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from Minneapolis. The unrest highlights ongoing concerns about federal law enforcement actions in the city and the impact on community trust.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Storm Hits the United States</h2>
<p>A major winter storm is affecting nearly half of the U.S. states, forcing almost all of them to declare emergencies. The storm has caused at least seven deaths and left approximately 800,000 people without power. Officials have warned of life-threatening conditions that could disrupt the lives of up to 180 million people. The severity of the weather poses ongoing challenges for emergency responders and residents in the impacted regions as they work to restore power and ensure public safety.</p>
<h2>Ferry Tragedy in the Philippines</h2>
<p>Fifteen people have died after the ferry MV Trisha Kerstin, carrying around 300 passengers, sank in the Philippines. Rescue efforts continue as local coast guard teams search for 28 passengers still reported missing. This accident is a significant maritime disaster that has raised urgent concerns about ferry safety in the region and the fates of those still unaccounted for.</p>
<h2>Australia Faces Intense Heatwave</h2>
<p>As Australians celebrate their national day, millions are also bracing for a severe heatwave. Temperatures are expected to reach the "high forties" Celsius in Victoria and South Australia, prompting heatwave warnings. This extreme weather event has the potential to affect public health and safety, with officials likely preparing measures to cope with the high temperatures and associated risks.</p>
<h2>Japan Returns Pandas to China Amid Diplomatic Strains</h2>
<p>Japan has sent twin panda cubs back to China, marking the first time since 1972 that the country will have no pandas in captivity. The departure of the animals comes amid worsening diplomatic relations between Japan and China. The pandas' return is a symbolic move, reflecting the current state of ties between the two countries, and may influence cultural and diplomatic interactions going forward.</p>
<h2>Russia’s Use of Interpol to Target Critics</h2>
<p>A recent leak has revealed that Russia is misusing Interpol’s wanted list to target critics living abroad. This exposes how Russia may be manipulating international law enforcement mechanisms for political purposes. The disclosure raises concerns about the integrity of Interpol processes and the safety of dissidents overseas.</p>
