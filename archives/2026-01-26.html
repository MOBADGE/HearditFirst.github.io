    <h2>Hostage Return in Israel</h2>
<p>Israel announced that it has recovered the remains of Ran Gvili, the final hostage held from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the return as "an extraordinary achievement." This development may bring closure to families of hostages and affect ongoing tensions related to the conflict with Gaza.</p>
<h2>Violence and Unrest in Multiple Regions</h2>
<p>Several serious incidents of violence have been reported worldwide. In Mexico, gunmen attacked a football pitch in Salamanca, killing at least 11 people in a city known for gang-related violence. Meanwhile, Minneapolis has seen two fatal shootings by federal agents in recent weeks, generating frustration and fear among residents.</p>
<p>In Iran, new video footage emerged showing a hospital in Tehran with at least 31 bodies piled inside and several body bags outside. The context and cause of these deaths have not been explained, but the images highlight ongoing turmoil.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Developments in Africa</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, 16 officers detained last year face trial after being accused of plotting a coup to overthrow President Bola Tinubu. This legal action comes after an investigation that uncovered the alleged plan, signaling efforts to address political stability in the country.</p>
<p>In Uganda, Barbara Kyagulanyi, wife of opposition leader Bobi Wine, accused the military of assaulting her. However, the country's military chief denied these claims. The dispute centers around Kyagulanyi's refusal to disclose her husband's whereabouts, reflecting ongoing political tensions.</p>
<h2>Transportation Safety Concerns in Europe and the US</h2>
<p>Spain has reduced the speed limit on the Madrid-Barcelona train line following the discovery of a crack on the track. This precaution comes after two recent deadly train crashes in the country and aims to improve safety on this important route.</p>
<p>In the United States, a private jet carrying eight people crashed in Maine amid a winter storm with poor visibility. The storm has impacted a large part of the country, complicating travel and emergency responses.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation and Technology Investigations</h2>
<p>France's parliament has taken an initial step toward banning social media use for children under 15. Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu announced plans to fast-track the legislation for implementation by September, aiming to address concerns around youth online safety.</p>
<p>Separately, the European Commission launched an investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X over concerns that sexually explicit deepfake images created by Grok AI may have been shown to users in the EU. The probe will assess compliance with digital content rules and the handling of manipulated media.</p>
