    <h2>Hostage Remains Recovered in Israel</h2>
<p>Israel has retrieved the remains of the final hostage from Gaza, a development Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called "an extraordinary achievement." The return of Ran Gvili’s remains marks the conclusion of efforts to recover all hostages linked to recent conflicts. This step closes a painful chapter for families and the nation, although the broader conflict in the region continues.</p>
<h2>Violence and Security Concerns in Minneapolis and Mexico</h2>
<p>Minnesota’s largest city is grappling with tensions after two fatal shootings by federal agents in recent weeks. Local residents expressed anger and frustration over the incidents, which have intensified concerns about law enforcement and public safety.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Salamanca, Mexico, gunmen attacked a football match, killing at least 11 people. The city is known for gang-related violence, and this event highlights ongoing security challenges. Both incidents underline persistent problems with violence and law enforcement in urban areas.</p>
<h2>Policy Changes on Social Media for Children in France</h2>
<p>France is moving quickly to implement a ban on social media for children under 15, a policy supported by President Emmanuel Macron. Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu announced a fast-track legislative process aiming to have the ban in place by September. The government cites concerns about the impact of social media on young people's well-being as the motivation for this measure.</p>
<h2>Transportation Safety Measures in Spain</h2>
<p>Following two recent deadly train crashes, Spanish authorities discovered a crack on the Madrid-Barcelona rail line, prompting an immediate reduction in speed limits on the route. The move aims to improve safety and prevent further accidents. This response reflects growing attention to infrastructure maintenance and public safety in Spain’s transportation system.</p>
<h2>International and Cultural Updates</h2>
<p>Japan has returned its last remaining pandas to China, ending more than 50 years of panda residency in the country. The departure of twin cubs leaves Japan without any pandas for the first time since 1972 and comes amid deteriorating relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>In India, tributes have poured in for Sir Mark Tully, a well-known former BBC broadcaster who lived in Delhi. His cremation was held recently, honoring his long association with the country and his contributions to journalism.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>A private jet carrying eight people crashed in Maine amid poor visibility caused by a widespread winter storm affecting large parts of the US. Details of the crash and the condition of those involved have not been fully reported.</p>
<p>In Uganda, the military chief denied accusations that soldiers assaulted Barbara Kyagulanyi, wife of opposition leader Bobi Wine. Barbara stated she refused to disclose her husband's whereabouts, adding to ongoing political tensions in the country.</p>
<p>The European Union has launched an investigation into Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, over concerns about sexually explicit deepfake images created by Grok AI being shown to users in the EU. The inquiry will examine potential misuse of manipulated content within the platform.</p>
