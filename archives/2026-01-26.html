    <h2>United States Faces Deadly Winter Storm and Plane Crash</h2>
<p>A severe winter storm across multiple US states has caused significant disruption, leaving thousands without power and resulting in at least a dozen deaths. The harsh weather has also led to widespread flight delays. In Maine, poor visibility linked to the storm was reported at the airport where a private jet carrying eight people crashed, adding to the day's tragic events. Emergency services continue to respond to these incidents as the storm affects a large part of the country.</p>
<h2>Violence and Security Concerns in Mexico</h2>
<p>In Salamanca, Mexico, a violent incident occurred when gunmen stormed a football pitch, killing at least 11 people. Salamanca is known for gang-related violence, and this attack underscores ongoing security challenges in the region. Meanwhile, former Olympian Ryan Wedding was taken into custody last week by the FBI in Mexico. He has pleaded not guilty to charges related to being a drug kingpin and alleged cartel leadership, highlighting continued efforts to tackle organized crime.</p>
<h2>France Moves to Ban Social Media for Children Under 15</h2>
<p>French lawmakers have taken the first step toward banning social media use for individuals under 15 years old. Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu announced the government would use a fast-track procedure to pass the legislation, aiming to have it enacted by September. The move reflects growing concerns about the effects of social media on young people, with the government seeking to regulate access more tightly.</p>
<h2>Tensions and Unrest in Iran and Nigeria</h2>
<p>New videos from Iran show disturbing scenes in a Tehran hospital, where at least 31 bodies were seen piled inside and seven body bags placed outside. Additionally, footage shows snipers on roofs, suggesting heightened security and unrest in the city. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, an investigation into a coup plot last year has led to some of the 16 detained officers being formally accused of planning to overthrow President Bola Tinubu. Those accused are set to face trial, emphasizing ongoing political tensions within the country.</p>
<h2>Israel Retrieves Final Gaza Hostage Remains</h2>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the retrieval of the remains of Ran Gvili, the final hostage from Gaza. He described the return as "an extraordinary achievement." This development may bring some closure to families affected by the conflict and could influence further diplomatic or security actions moving forward.</p>
<h2>Transport Safety Measures in Spain</h2>
<p>Following two recent deadly train crashes in Spain, authorities have discovered a crack on the Madrid-Barcelona train line. In response, they have dramatically reduced the speed limit on this popular route to enhance safety. This action comes as part of ongoing efforts to prevent further accidents and improve railway infrastructure.</p>
