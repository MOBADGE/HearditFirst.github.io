    <h2>Swiss Ski Resort Fire</h2>
<p>A fire broke out at the Le Constellation bar in the Crans-Montana ski resort in Switzerland, resulting in around 40 deaths and injuring approximately 115 people, some with serious injuries. The incident has shaken the popular resort and is currently under investigation. Emergency services responded to the scene to provide medical aid and manage the situation.</p>
<h2>Tensions in Iran and the Netherlands</h2>
<p>In Iran, clashes between protesters and security forces have led to two deaths. The protests, which have now entered their fifth day, are marked by videos showing cars set on fire amid ongoing confrontations. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, New Year's celebrations were marred by significant unrest. Police reported "unprecedented" violence, with widespread use of fireworks and explosives against officers across the country.</p>
<h2>Peace Talks on Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky announced in his New Year address that a peace deal with Russia is 90% complete, signaling potential progress toward ending the conflict. On the other side, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed confidence in Russian troops, affirming his belief in victory during his New Year speech. The statements suggest both sides are preparing for significant developments in the coming period.</p>
<h2>US Military Actions Against Drug Smuggling</h2>
<p>The US military reported killing five people in a recent strike targeting suspected drug boats. This operation follows another strike a day earlier, for which the US Coast Guard is still searching for survivors. These actions highlight ongoing US efforts to combat drug trafficking in maritime regions.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Sports Updates</h2>
<p>Fans across the US and Canada celebrated the finale of the popular series Stranger Things with big-screen premiere events, marking the end of the show's run with a highly emotional reception. In sports news, former world boxing champion Anthony Joshua has been discharged from the hospital following a car accident in Nigeria that tragically killed two of his close friends. Also, football legend Roberto Carlos is recovering well after a preventative medical procedure.</p>
<h2>Archaeological Discovery in Ireland</h2>
<p>Researcher Dr. Dirk Brandherm and his team have uncovered over 600 suspected house platforms in the Brusselstown Ring, a find that may challenge the long-held belief that Vikings established the first towns in Ireland.
