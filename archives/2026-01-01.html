    <h2>Ukraine Conflict Update</h2>
<p>In his New Year address, Volodymyr Zelensky said a peace deal with Russia is about 90% ready, signaling progress towards ending the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed confidence in a Russian victory, addressing his troops with words of belief and encouragement. The ongoing conflict, now nearing its fourth year, remains a central focus for both countries and the international community, with expectations that negotiations might pick up pace in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Life in Russia Amid the War</h2>
<p>BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg interviewed people across Russia as the war in Ukraine continues. The coverage revealed a range of hopes and concerns among Russians for 2026. Many are looking for stability and peace, while acknowledging the challenges facing the country domestically and internationally. This insight helps paint a picture of the social climate in Russia during this prolonged conflict.</p>
<h2>Unrest in Iran</h2>
<p>Iran has seen an escalation of protests triggered by a collapse in its currency, leading to widespread economic difficulties. Security forces have reported casualties among their ranks, with one member killed during recent demonstrations. The protests are reported across multiple cities, reflecting a growing discontent that may affect the country’s political and economic situation in the near future.</p>
<h2>Historic Milestone in New York City</h2>
<p>Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City's first Muslim mayor. He took his oath in a notable location—a disused subway station beneath Old City Hall—and used a Quran for the ceremony, marking a historic moment for the city. His leadership may introduce new policies and perspectives reflecting the diverse population he represents in one of the world's largest cities.</p>
<h2>Significant Incidents and Events</h2>
<p>Several notable incidents occurred recently. Boxing figure Anthony Joshua has been discharged from hospital after surviving a serious car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends. In California, a 19-year-old named Marcus Alexander Muench Casanova died after falling from a trail on Mount Baldy. Additionally, a worker at a Disney attraction was injured after being struck by a large rubber boulder prop during a stunt, but is currently recovering.</p>
<h2>Cultural Moments and Celebrations</h2>
<p>Around the globe, people welcomed the arrival of 2026 with various traditional and festive activities. Firework displays lit up major cities, and some took part in cold sea dips to mark the new year. However, the celebrations were tempered in Amsterdam, where a historic church caught fire shortly after midnight. The blaze was quickly classified as a major fire, drawing attention to the preservation challenges of cultural heritage sites.</p>
<p>These developments highlight a mix of political, social, and cultural events shaping the start of 2026 worldwide.</p>
