    <h2>Fire at Swiss Ski Resort Kills Around 40</h2>
<p>A major fire broke out at the Le Constellation bar in the Crans-Montana ski resort in Switzerland, resulting in around 40 deaths. Authorities reported that 115 people were injured, some with serious injuries. Details on the cause of the fire have not yet been released. This tragedy is one of the deadliest incidents at a ski resort bar and will likely prompt investigations into fire safety measures at similar venues.</p>
<h2>Protests and Violence in Iran and the Netherlands</h2>
<p>In Iran, protests marked their fifth day with clashes between security forces and demonstrators. At least two people have died amid violent confrontations, including incidents where cars were set on fire. The unrest indicates ongoing tensions within the country, with no clear end in sight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, police faced widespread and what they described as “unprecedented” levels of violence during New Year's celebrations. Reports of fireworks and explosives being thrown were common, leading to significant disruptions and a challenging night for law enforcement across the country.</p>
<h2>Progress Toward Ukraine Peace Deal</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that a peace deal with Russia is about 90% ready during his New Year address. This announcement comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech expressing belief in his troops and confidence in victory in Ukraine. The situation remains complex, but Zelensky’s comments suggest talks may soon reach a critical stage.</p>
<h2>US Military Strike on Suspected Drug Boats</h2>
<p>The US military reported that five people were killed in its latest strike on boats suspected of involvement in drug trafficking. This operation follows another strike the previous day, with the US Coast Guard continuing to search for survivors. These actions highlight ongoing efforts to disrupt illicit drug shipments at sea.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Personal Updates</h2>
<p>The popular TV series *Stranger Things* concluded its run with an emotional and epic finale, drawing fans to premieres across the United States and Canada. The event marked the end of a cultural phenomenon beloved by many.</p>
<p>On a personal health note, football legend Roberto Carlos is recovering well after a preventative medical procedure. Meanwhile, former boxing champion Anthony Joshua has been discharged from the hospital following a car accident in Nigeria that killed two of his closest friends.</p>
<p>In a lighter incident, a Disney worker was injured but is recovering after being hit by a 180-kilogram fake boulder prop during a show. The worker’s quick response helped prevent harm to audience members.</p>
<h2>New Archaeological Findings on Viking Settlements</h2>
<p>A recent discovery by Dr. Dirk Brandherm and colleagues challenges the idea that Vikings built the first towns in Ireland. Their research identified over 600 suspected house platforms at the Brusselstown Ring site, suggesting a more complex and possibly earlier pattern of settlement than previously thought. This finding may change understanding of early Irish urban development.</p>
