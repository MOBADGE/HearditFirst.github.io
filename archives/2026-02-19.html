    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 19, 2026</div>
    <h2>Middle East Tensions and US Military Moves</h2>
<p>The US is increasing its military presence in the Middle East amid rising tensions with Iran. President Donald Trump has discussed possible attack options with advisers, with reports suggesting a strike could occur as soon as Saturday. Meanwhile, the US has announced plans to withdraw its troops from Syria, a move linked to the broader strategic shifts as relations with Iran remain strained. These developments come as diplomatic efforts continue, with the White House pushing Iran to reach a deal despite the escalating military posturing.</p>
<h2>Situation in Gaza</h2>
<p>Despite heavy losses in conflicts with Israel, Hamas is regaining control within Gaza. Residents report that the group is extending its authority over security forces, tax collections, and government services. This reassertion of control indicates Hamas’s efforts to stabilize its influence in Gaza following recent fighting, which could affect the internal dynamics of the region and future interactions with Israel.</p>
<h2>US Domestic News: Congressional Testimony and Investigations</h2>
<p>Les Wexner, the billionaire former CEO of Victoria’s Secret, testified before a US congressional panel, describing himself as "naive" and "conned" by Jeffrey Epstein. He accused Epstein of embezzling large sums of money from his family. This testimony adds to the ongoing scrutiny of Epstein’s financial network and its impact on significant figures.</p>
<p>In another domestic case, the search for Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of US presenter Savannah Guthrie, continues into a third week. Efforts have now extended to Mexico as authorities and family members seek leads on her whereabouts.</p>
<h2>Technology and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the company during a landmark trial focused on social media addiction. He expressed regret for not more quickly identifying users under the age of 13 on the platform. This trial may have implications for how social media companies manage youth user safety and digital wellbeing in the future.</p>
<p>In a related development involving technology and conflict, Elon Musk has cut Starlink internet access to Russian forces. Ukrainian troops report that this disruption has caused setbacks for Russian military operations, providing Ukraine with a tactical advantage on the frontlines.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Miscellaneous News</h2>
<p>The Rio Carnival concluded with the float featuring Brazil’s Lula coming in last place in the competition among the city’s top samba schools. The festival remains a significant cultural event, drawing attention worldwide.</p>
<p>In Australia, presenter Danika Mason apologized after a live Olympics report featured slurred speech. She attributed the incident to the cold weather and discussed unrelated topics such as coffee and iguanas during the broadcast, which led to public attention and her subsequent apology.</p>
<h2>Europe: France Arrests and Political Tensions</h2>
<p>In France, police have arrested eleven people suspected of involvement in the killing of far-right student activist Quentin Deranque. The arrests are increasing pressure on far-left political groups amid heightened tensions and ongoing investigations into the case.</p>
