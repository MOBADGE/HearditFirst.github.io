    <h2>South Korea's Former President Sentenced to Life</h2>
<p>A court in South Korea sentenced the country’s former president to life imprisonment for his attempt to impose martial law in December 2024. The judge said this move severely damaged South Korea’s democratic system. The conviction marks a significant legal response to what was seen as an effort to undermine democratic governance.</p>
<h2>UN Reports Genocide Markers in Sudan Conflict</h2>
<p>A United Nations fact-finding mission has described atrocities committed during the capture of el-Fasher by the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan as having the hallmarks of genocide. The report highlights serious concerns over the ongoing violence and signals potential international legal and humanitarian actions.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Tensions Rise Amid Military Buildup</h2>
<p>The White House is intensifying pressure on Iran to reach a diplomatic agreement while simultaneously increasing US military presence in the region. Reports indicate that former US president Trump has discussed options for a potential strike against Iran with advisers, possibly as soon as this weekend. This development underscores the delicate and escalating situation in Middle East diplomacy and security.</p>
<h2>Hamas Reasserts Control in Gaza</h2>
<p>Despite heavy losses from recent conflicts with Israel, Hamas is regaining its authority over Gaza. Residents report that Hamas is reclaiming control over aspects such as security, tax collection, and government services in the territory. This resurgence may influence the region’s political balance and the dynamics of future interactions with Israel and the international community.</p>

<p>Following a massive avalanche on Tuesday, eight skiers were found dead in California’s Lake Tahoe area. Fifteen skiers had gone missing after the incident, and one person remains unaccounted for but is presumed deceased. Rescue and recovery efforts are ongoing, and the tragedy highlights the dangers of winter sports in mountainous regions.</p>
<h2>Kenyan Recruitment to Russia-Ukraine War Under Investigation</h2>
