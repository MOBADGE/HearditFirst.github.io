    <h2>US-Iran Tensions and Military Moves</h2>
<p>The White House is intensifying efforts to reach a deal with Iran amid rising tensions in the Middle East. Reports indicate that former US President Donald Trump has discussed possible military strike options against Iran with his advisers, with a strike potentially planned as soon as this weekend. Meanwhile, the US has announced plans to withdraw troops from Syria, even as it increases its military presence elsewhere in the region due to strained relations with Iran. These developments suggest a complex and volatile situation that could impact regional stability and US foreign policy moving forward.</p>
<h2>Gaza: Hamas Tightens Grip</h2>
<p>Despite suffering significant losses in the ongoing conflict with Israel, Hamas is reasserting its control over Gaza. Residents report that Hamas is expanding its authority over local security, tax collection, and government services. This consolidation shows the group's resilience and may shape the governance and daily lives of Gazans in the coming months, influencing both the political landscape and humanitarian conditions in the area.</p>
<h2>UK-US Disagreement Over Chagos Islands</h2>
<p>Tensions have surfaced between the US and the UK concerning the Chagos Islands deal. Donald Trump criticized the agreement in a recent statement, urging the UK not to give away Diego Garcia, a strategic island in the archipelago. His comments came shortly after the US officially endorsed the UK’s arrangement, highlighting ongoing disagreements about the islands’ future and their geopolitical importance.</p>
<h2>Notable Events and Apologies in Media</h2>
<p>At the Rio Carnival in Brazil, the float featuring Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva finished last as samba schools competed for top honors. Also, in Australia, broadcaster Danika Mason apologized after delivering a slurred report during the Winter Olympics coverage. She attributed her performance to the cold weather and admitted to drinking before going on air. These lighter stories offer a contrast to the more serious news circulating globally.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Investigations and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>The search for Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of US television presenter Savannah Guthrie, has moved into its third week and expanded to include Mexico as authorities seek new leads. In Washington, former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner testified before Congress, describing himself as "naive" and claiming he was deceived by Jeffrey Epstein, who allegedly stole large sums of money from Wexner's family. Additionally, in France, police have detained 11 people in connection with the killing of far-right activist Quentin Deranque, an event increasing scrutiny on far-left groups. These investigations continue to develop with important implications for justice and public trust.</p>
<h2>Technology Sector Developments</h2>
<p>In a high-profile trial, Mark Zuckerberg defended Meta, the parent company of Facebook, amid accusations related to social media addiction. He acknowledged regret over not moving faster to limit underage users on the platform, particularly those under 13 years old. This case is significant as it could influence future regulations and corporate responsibility in the fast-evolving digital landscape.</p>
