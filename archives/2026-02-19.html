    <h2>South Korea's Former President Sentenced for Martial Law Attempt</h2>
<p>A South Korean court has sentenced the country's former president to life in prison for attempting to impose martial law in December 2024. The judge described this action as fundamentally damaging to South Korea’s democracy. This ruling underscores the serious legal consequences of undermining democratic institutions and may serve as a cautionary example within South Korea and beyond.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Relations and Military Activity</h2>
<p>The United States is intensifying both diplomatic and military efforts concerning Iran. The White House is actively pressing Iran to reach a deal amid reports that President Donald Trump has discussed possible military strikes with his advisers. A strike could occur imminently, with some reports suggesting as early as Saturday. Meanwhile, the US plans to withdraw troops from Syria but is simultaneously increasing its military presence in the Middle East due to escalating tensions with Iran. These developments highlight ongoing volatility in regional security and diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>Hamas Regains Control in Gaza</h2>
<p>Despite suffering heavy losses during recent conflicts with Israel, Hamas is reasserting its control over key areas in Gaza. Residents report that the group is extending its authority over security forces, tax collection, and the management of government services. This consolidation of power could impact stability in the region and future interactions between Gaza and Israel.</p>
<h2>US-UK Disagreement Over Chagos Islands Deal</h2>
<p>In a new point of contention between the United States and the United Kingdom, Trump has urged the UK not to cede control of Diego Garcia, part of the disputed Chagos Archipelago. This statement came just one day after the US officially backed the UK's deal concerning the islands. The disagreement may affect diplomatic relations between the two countries and the strategic use of the islands.</p>
