    <h2>Sudan Violence Described as Genocide by UN</h2>
<p>A United Nations fact-finding mission has reported that atrocities committed in Sudan, particularly following the capture of el-Fasher by the Rapid Support Forces, bear the "hallmarks of genocide." The report highlights serious violations against civilians during the conflict. This designation underscores the severity of the situation in Sudan and may increase international pressure for intervention or protective measures to prevent further violence.</p>
<h2>Gaza Relief Pledged Amid Hamas Developments</h2>
<p>A board of peace members associated with former US President Donald Trump has committed $7 billion in relief aid for Gaza. Trump said he believes Hamas "looks like" it will disarm, despite reports indicating the group is regaining control in Gaza. Residents note that Hamas is reasserting authority over security, tax collection, and government functions. The situation suggests ongoing instability, with potential impacts on humanitarian access and regional security.</p>
<h2>Avalanche Fatalities Raise Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>This season has seen an increase in avalanche-related deaths, with more than 90 fatalities reported so far. A recent tragedy in California’s Lake Tahoe area resulted in eight confirmed deaths and one person still missing after a massive avalanche affected skiers. Similar deadly incidents in Europe have prompted renewed attention on avalanche risks and safety measures for outdoor enthusiasts during winter. Authorities and experts are focusing on prevention and awareness to reduce future losses.</p>
<h2>Legal Actions Against Former Leaders and Associates</h2>
<p>In South Korea, a judge sentenced Yoon Suk Yeol to life imprisonment for his attempt in December 2024 to impose martial law. The court described this act as deeply damaging to South Korea’s democratic institutions. Meanwhile, Bellarmine Mugabe, son of Robert Mugabe, was arrested in South Africa on suspicion of attempted murder following a shooting incident involving a worker where he stayed. These developments highlight ongoing accountability efforts for actions linked to political figures and their families.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Tensions and Military Posture</h2>
<p>The White House is urging Iran toward a diplomatic agreement while simultaneously increasing its military presence in the region. Media reports indicate that former US President Trump has discussed possible military strike options with advisers, with a strike potentially occurring as soon as this weekend. This dual approach reflects heightened tensions and raises the possibility of escalating conflict if diplomatic efforts do not progress.</p>
<h2>Release of Belarusian Dissident</h2>
<p>Mikola Statkevich, a veteran dissident who declined exile and spent over five years imprisoned in Belarus, has been released. He is currently recovering at home from a stroke, according to his wife. His release may signal changes in Belarus or increased international scrutiny of its treatment of political prisoners.</p>
