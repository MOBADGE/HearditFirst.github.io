    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 08, 2026</div>
    <h2>Asia Election Results</h2>
<p>Japan's Prime Minister Takaichi is on track for a large victory in a snap election. Her ruling coalition is expected to win about two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives, securing a strong majority. This outcome will likely strengthen her government’s ability to implement policies without much resistance.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the ruling conservative party also claimed a clear victory in parliamentary elections. Contrary to recent opinion polls that favored the reformist People's Party, the conservatives performed well ahead of their rivals. This result could mean continuity in Thailand’s current political direction.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime Developments</h2>
<p>In Russia, authorities have named three suspects connected to the shooting of a general. One of the suspects, Lyubomir Korba, is accused of being the gunman and reportedly fled to the United Arab Emirates after the incident. This case remains under investigation.</p>
<p>France is facing complexity in a murder trial involving twin brothers. Police recovered DNA evidence from a weapon used in the case but have not been able to determine which brother it belongs to because they share identical DNA. This poses a challenge for the prosecution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in New Zealand, the Christchurch mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant is trying to overturn his guilty plea. He is currently serving a life sentence for the 2019 attack that killed 51 people, but details on his appeal attempt were not provided.</p>
<h2>High-Profile Prisoner Releases and Sentences</h2>
<p>Venezuela’s interim government announced the release of 18 political prisoners, including Juan Pablo Guanipa, a leader of the Justice First party. This move may have implications for the country’s political climate and opposition activities.</p>
<p>In Iran, Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi received an additional prison sentence. She was arrested in December after making what authorities considered "provocative remarks" at a memorial event and was reportedly beaten during her detention. Her case continues to attract international attention.</p>
<h2>Sports Injury Update</h2>
<p>American skier Lindsey Vonn was injured during the women’s downhill competition in Cortina. Competing with a torn ACL, she suffered a fracture to her left leg and underwent surgery. This incident may mark the end of her Olympic career, disappointing fans and highlighting the risks athletes face.</p>
<h2>Personal Story in the US</h2>
<p>In a personal appeal, US news anchor Savannah Guthrie has urged for the safe return of her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona. The 84-year-old vanished overnight last weekend. Savannah pledged "we will pay" for any assistance leading to her mother’s return. The search and investigation are ongoing.</p>
