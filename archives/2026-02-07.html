    <div class="date">February 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Ukraine's leader said that the United States wants the war between his country and Russia to end by June. This comes amid ongoing challenges, with Russia continuing strikes on energy facilities in Ukraine. Despite the difficulties, talks about ending the war remain active, highlighting efforts to reach a resolution in the near future.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political News in Europe</h2>
<p>In France, former minister Jack Lang is under investigation for alleged involvement in laundering proceeds from tax fraud. He has resigned from his position at a prestigious institute as authorities probe his links to Jeffrey Epstein-related issues. Meanwhile, in Italy, police are investigating three deliberate attacks on railway infrastructure, described as "serious sabotage." These incidents have caused travel delays just as the Winter Olympics are beginning.</p>
<h2>United States: Controversies and Legal Cases</h2>
<p>The White House shared a doctored image related to Nekima Levy Armstrong, who was arrested for organizing a protest in a church. Ms. Armstrong has spoken out against the circulation of the fake image, drawing attention to concerns about misinformation.</p>
<p>Also in the US, Donald Trump addressed a controversy surrounding a video he shared that included a racist clip depicting former US presidents Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. Trump said he "didn't see" that part of the video and claimed he had only viewed the beginning before posting it, denying that he made a mistake.</p>
<p>In Colorado, a funeral home director was sentenced to 40 years in prison after officials discovered nearly 200 decaying bodies at the facility. The case involved reports of foul odors that triggered an investigation into the mistreatment of corpses.</p>
<h2>Technology and Finance</h2>
<p>A South Korean cryptocurrency company accidentally paid out $40 billion worth of bitcoin due to a mistake. Fortunately, the company quickly realized the error and was able to recover almost all of the missing tokens from customers. This incident highlights the risks and complexities involved in managing large sums of digital currency.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Developments</h2>
<p>In Moscow, Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev was shot multiple times inside his apartment block but remains conscious following surgery, according to Russian media reports. Details about the motive or suspects are not yet clear.</p>
<p>In Zambia, the country's leader publicly supported the traditional Ghanaian outfit worn by Ghana's president, pushing back against online criticism. Some people in Zambia had dismissed the attire as a "blouse," causing a minor diplomatic and cultural dispute online.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>Brad Arnold, the lead singer of the rock band 3 Doors Down, died at the age of 47. He had announced a stage 4 cancer diagnosis in May 2025. His passing marks a loss for fans of the band and the music community.</p>
