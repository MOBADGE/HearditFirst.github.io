    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump responded to controversy involving a video posted online that included a racist depiction of the Obamas. He said he "didn't see" the part of the video showing the offensive clip and maintained that he "didn't make a mistake," explaining he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was shared publicly. Additionally, Trump issued a threat of tariffs against countries that trade with Iran, suggesting a possible 25% tariff without specifying exact rates. These developments signal ongoing tensions in US domestic politics and foreign relations.</p>
<h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>Authorities in Colorado have sentenced the director of a funeral home to 40 years in prison following the discovery of nearly 200 decaying bodies at the facility, Return to Nature, after complaints about a foul smell. This case has drawn attention to funeral home oversight and the treatment of human remains.</p>
<p>In a separate case, police are investigating new leads in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of NBC News presenter Savannah Guthrie. She went missing from her home in Tucson, Arizona, nearly a week ago and is believed to have been abducted. The investigation continues amid public concern and media attention.</p>
<h2>International Incidents</h2>
<p>A deadly blast killed more than 30 people and injured nearly 170 during Friday prayers at a mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital. The attack highlights ongoing security challenges in the region and the vulnerability of places of worship to violence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reflections on the current situation in Iran show a divided public opinion about potential US intervention. Some Iranians inside and outside the country hope for American help amid unrest, while others worry that outside involvement may not bring the peace that protesters seek.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>Several prominent Black American entertainers, including the singer Ciara and actor Samuel L Jackson, have recently become citizens of African countries. This trend points to shifting cultural connections and the desire among some African Americans to strengthen ties with the continent.</p>
<p>In entertainment news, Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny prepares to perform on the Super Bowl halftime stage, one of the world’s biggest venues. With performances at the event increasingly sparking debate, questions remain about how he will handle critics and use the platform.</p>
<h2>Human Interest</h2>
<p>In India, retired factory worker Anke Gowda has built an extensive library collection of two million books that is open to the public. His efforts have been recognized with a government award, highlighting a remarkable personal contribution to education and community resources.</p>
