    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Politics and International Relations</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump addressed controversy over a video posted on his social media that contained a racist clip depicting the Obamas as apes. He said he "didn't see" that part of the video and only watched the beginning before it was uploaded. Trump maintained that he "didn't make a mistake" in sharing the content, despite public criticism.</p>
<p>In another development regarding foreign policy, Trump issued a warning that the US could impose tariffs on countries that continue trading with Iran. While the exact tariff rate was not specified in the order, a figure of 25% was mentioned as an example. This move reflects ongoing tensions related to Iran and attempts to exert economic pressure through trade measures.</p>
<h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>A Colorado funeral home director was sentenced to 40 years in prison following the discovery of nearly 200 decaying bodies at the facility called Return to Nature. Officials uncovered the situation after responding to complaints about a foul smell, leading to an investigation that exposed extreme corpse abuse at the site.</p>
<p>In Arizona, police are investigating new information regarding the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of NBC News presenter Savannah Guthrie. Nancy went missing from her home in Tucson almost a week ago, and authorities are continuing efforts to locate her with no new sightings reported so far.</p>
<h2>Violence and Terrorism in Pakistan</h2>
<p>At least 31 people were killed and nearly 170 injured when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device inside a Shia mosque during Friday prayers in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. This deadly attack led to rapid emergency response efforts, while police continue their investigation into the security breach and motives behind the bombing.</p>
<h2>Iranian Perspectives on US Involvement</h2>
<p>Iranians both inside and outside the country have expressed mixed feelings about possible US involvement in Iran's internal issues. Some people who are desperate for change hope the US will intervene to help peace protesters achieve their goals. However, others are concerned that foreign intervention might not produce the peaceful outcomes desired by those advocating for reform.</p>
<h2>Culture and Community Initiatives</h2>
<p>In a lighter story, Anke Gowda, a retired factory worker from India, has been recognized for building a large public library that houses two million books. Open to everyone, the library recently earned Gowda an Indian government award, highlighting grassroots efforts to promote literacy and community learning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny is preparing for a highly anticipated performance at the Super Bowl half-time show. As this platform has become increasingly politically and socially charged, there is curiosity about how he will address or respond to his critics on the world's biggest stage.</p>
