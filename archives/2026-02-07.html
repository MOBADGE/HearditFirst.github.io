    <h2>U.S. President Comments on Racist Video Clip</h2>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump addressed controversy over a video posted on social media that included a racist depiction of President Barack Obama and his wife as apes. Trump said he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was posted and stated that he "didn't make a mistake" by sharing it. The president denied having seen the offensive clip within the video, a point that has drawn criticism and raised questions about his judgment in sharing such content.</p>
<h2>New U.S. Tariff Threats Related to Iran</h2>
<p>President Trump has issued an order threatening to impose tariffs on countries that continue trading with Iran. While the directive did not set a specific tariff rate, it referenced a 25% tariff as an example of what might be applied. This move signals potential escalation in trade tensions involving Iran and could have wider diplomatic and economic repercussions, depending on how trading partners respond to these threats.</p>
