    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Diplomatic Efforts</h2>
<p>Ukraine's leader has stated that the United States wants Russia and Ukraine to end their war by June. Despite ongoing talks, difficult issues remain unresolved. Meanwhile, Russia continues to carry out strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities, intensifying the conflict. The situation remains tense, and international diplomatic efforts will be closely watched to see if a ceasefire or peace deal can be reached in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Security Incident in Moscow</h2>
<p>In Moscow, Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev was shot multiple times inside his apartment block on Friday morning. Russian media report that he is currently conscious following surgery. The reasons behind the shooting have not been detailed yet, and investigations are likely underway. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about security in the Russian capital.</p>
<h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump commented on a controversy involving a racist video depicting former US presidents Barack and Michelle Obama in a derogatory way. Trump said he "didn't see" the part of the clip that included the offensive content and maintained he "didn't make a mistake," stating he had only viewed the beginning of the video before it was posted online.</p>
<p>Separately, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on countries that trade with Iran. The order mentioned a 25% tariff rate as an example but did not specify the exact rates that might be applied. This move could have significant implications for global trade relations and US foreign policy.</p>
<h2>Transportation Disruptions in Italy</h2>
<p>Italy is investigating incidents described as "serious sabotage" targeting rail infrastructure. Three separate events caused delays to travel just as the Winter Olympics began. Authorities are looking into the motives and perpetrators behind the attacks, which pose risks to public safety and disrupt transportation during a major international event.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>- In Colorado, a funeral home director was sentenced to 40 years in prison after nearly 200 decaying bodies were found at the facility. The investigation began following complaints about a foul smell emanating from the Return to Nature home.</p>
<p>- A South Korean cryptocurrency firm accidentally paid out $40 billion worth of bitcoin due to an error. The company quickly realized the mistake and managed to recover nearly all the tokens from customers, preventing significant financial loss.</p>
<p>- Zambia’s leader publicly supported a traditional Ghanaian outfit after some Zambians mocked it online, calling it a "blouse." This gesture was aimed at addressing the tensions caused by cultural misunderstandings on social media.</p>
