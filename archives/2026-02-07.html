    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Politics and Controversies</h2>
<p>US president Donald Trump recently removed a video that included a racist depiction of former presidents Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. Trump said he "didn't make a mistake" in posting the video, explaining that he had only seen the beginning of it before it was shared. This incident has drawn criticism and added to ongoing debates about the president's use of social media.</p>
<p>In a separate development on the same day, Trump signed an executive order threatening to impose tariffs on countries that trade with Iran. The order did not specify exact tariff rates but used 25% as an example. This move is part of the US administration's efforts to increase pressure on Iran, though the broader economic and diplomatic impacts remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>International Security: Pakistan Mosque Attack</h2>
<p>A deadly suicide bombing struck a Shia mosque in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad during Friday prayers. Officials reported at least 31 people killed and nearly 170 injured. The blast has intensified concerns about security and sectarian violence in the region, with investigations ongoing into the perpetrators and motives behind the attack.</p>
<h2>Missing Person Case in Arizona</h2>
<p>Authorities in Tucson, Arizona, are investigating the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of NBC News presenter Savannah Guthrie. Nancy Guthrie went missing from her home almost a week ago, and police are now following up on new information related to the case. The search continues amid growing public attention and concern.</p>
<h2>Social Perspectives on Iran</h2>
<p>Inside and outside Iran, opinions differ about the role the US might play in the ongoing unrest there. Some Iranians express desperation and support for potential US intervention to help restore peace. Others are skeptical, fearing that intervention might not lead to the kind of peaceful change protesters want. This highlights the complexity of public opinion amid Iran’s current political and social challenges.</p>
<h2>Human Interest: Library Built by Retired Worker</h2>
<p>In India, Anke Gowda, a retired factory worker, has created a vast library that houses two million books and is open to the public. His dedication to sharing knowledge recently earned him an official Indian government award. This story showcases the impact one individual can have in promoting education and access to information in their community.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Spotlight: Bad Bunny and the Super Bowl</h2>
<p>Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny is preparing for his performance at the Super Bowl half-time show, a stage considered the world's biggest for entertainers. With half-time shows becoming more polarizing in recent years, observers are watching to see how Bad Bunny will address or silence his critics while reaching a global audience.</p>
