    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump addressed controversy over a video that included a racist clip depicting the Obamas as apes. He stated that he “didn't make a mistake” and claimed he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was shared publicly. The response comes amid ongoing scrutiny of the content Trump has circulated on social media.</p>
<p>In addition, Trump issued a warning to countries trading with Iran, threatening to impose tariffs. While the order did not specify exact rates, it cited 25% as an example of the possible tariff level. This move is likely related to ongoing tensions regarding Iran’s international relations and trade practices.</p>
<h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>Tragic violence struck in Pakistan where over 30 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad during Friday prayers. Nearly 170 individuals were injured, highlighting continued sectarian and security challenges in the region.</p>
<p>In Colorado, a funeral home director was sentenced to 40 years in prison after authorities discovered nearly 200 decaying bodies at the facility following an investigation prompted by a foul smell. This case raised serious concerns about the handling and treatment of corpses by the funeral home.</p>
<h2>Missing Person Case</h2>
<p>Authorities in Tucson, Arizona, are investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, an 84-year-old woman and the mother of NBC News presenter Savannah Guthrie. She is believed to have been abducted from her home almost a week ago. Police have received a new message related to her case, which is being actively pursued. The story has drawn public attention as officials try to uncover more information about her whereabouts.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Highlights</h2>
<p>Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny is preparing for a high-profile performance at the Super Bowl half-time show, a stage known for its global reach but also increasing polarization. Many are watching to see how he navigates the challenges and expectations associated with such a significant platform.</p>
<p>In India, Anke Gowda, a retired factory worker, was recently recognized for creating one of the country’s largest private libraries with two million books accessible to the public. He received a government award for his dedication, reflecting the impact of grassroots cultural contributions.</p>
<h2>Perspectives on Iran</h2>
<p>Coverage from inside and outside Iran reveals mixed feelings about potential US involvement in the country. While some Iranians facing unrest hope for US intervention, others express concern that outside interference might not bring about the peaceful resolution that protesters desire. This complicated dynamic adds context to the broader geopolitical situation involving Iran.</p>
