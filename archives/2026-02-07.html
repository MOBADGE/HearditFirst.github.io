    <div class="date">February 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>U.S. Political Developments</h2>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump removed a video he posted that included a racist clip portraying President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. Trump said he "didn't make a mistake" and claimed he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was shared online.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump signed an executive order threatening to impose tariffs on countries that engage in trade with Iran. While the order did not set a specific tariff rate, it mentioned 25% as a possible example. This move signals a toughening stance on international trade related to Iran.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Search in Arizona</h2>
