    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Donald Trump held talks with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky that were described as “very good,” reflecting ongoing US efforts to formalize a deal involving Ukraine. This meeting coincided with US envoy Steve Witkoff's trip to Moscow for discussions with Russia's Vladimir Putin, highlighting diplomatic activity involving all parties in the Ukraine conflict. Meanwhile, the UK chose not to join Trump's proposed Board of Peace, with Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper citing concerns over Putin’s lack of commitment to peace in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In another diplomatic development, Trump outlined a "framework of future deal" concerning Greenland, the world’s largest island. However, Denmark and Greenland firmly reiterated their refusal to surrender sovereignty over the territory, maintaining their control despite the US interest.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Syria is experiencing a significant shift as Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) rapidly withdrew from the north-east region of Sharaa. This marks the most substantial territorial change in Syria since the fall of Bashar al-Assad, potentially altering the balance of power within the country and complicating the ongoing conflict dynamics.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of opposition candidate Edmundo González, was released from jail. Tudares had been detained following González’s run against Nicolás Maduro in the country's election, underscoring ongoing tensions surrounding political opposition in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>US immigration agents detained a five-year-old boy in Minnesota during an operation targeting his father. Local school officials confirmed the boy was taken with his father, though a government spokeswoman denied that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was specifically targeting the child. This event has raised questions about the handling of minors in immigration enforcement actions.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>New Zealand's North Island has been hit by severe landslides following heavy rainfall, resulting in two deaths and several people missing. Officials described the affected areas as resembling a "war zone," focusing search and rescue efforts amid dangerous conditions.</p>
<h2>Technology and Energy</h2>
<p>Japan suspended operations at the world’s largest nuclear plant just hours after restarting it. The plant’s operator stated that the reactor remains stable and that there has been no radioactive impact outside the facility. This suspension may affect Japan’s energy supply and raises questions about the future role of nuclear power in the country.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The vampire film *Sinners* made history by receiving 16 Oscar nominations, the most for any single film to date. This achievement highlights the film’s impact and popularity, setting a new record in the Academy Awards race this year.</p>
