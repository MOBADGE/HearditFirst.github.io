    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Diplomatic Talks</h2>
<p>The United States expresses optimism about a possible end to the ongoing war involving Ukraine. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky announced plans for talks involving Ukraine, the US, and Russia. At the same time, US envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Moscow. These developments indicate diplomatic efforts may be advancing, though the outcome remains uncertain.</p>
<h2>Tensions Over Russian Oil Transport</h2>
<p>France has seized a Russian oil tanker named Grinch in the Mediterranean Sea. The vessel was intercepted by the French navy while passing between Spain and Morocco. The tanker is suspected to be part of a "shadow fleet," a term often used for ships operating under sanctions or with hidden ownership, underscoring ongoing tensions related to Russian energy exports.</p>
<h2>Immigration Detention in Minnesota</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, a 5-year-old child was detained alongside his father by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). School officials and the family's lawyer reported the incident, while ICE clarified that the child was not the agency's target. The case highlights continuing concerns about immigration enforcement practices in the United States.</p>
<h2>Security and Control Shifts in Syria</h2>
<p>The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have experienced a rapid rollback in northeastern Syria. This shift represents the most significant territorial change since the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. The evolving control in the region continues to reshape the balance of power and may affect stability in Syria.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>Heavy rains in New Zealand's North Island have caused severe landslides, resulting in two confirmed deaths and several people missing. A government minister described the affected areas as resembling a "war zone." In Australia’s New South Wales, a shooting left three dead, prompting authorities to advise residents to stay indoors and avoid the area due to ongoing safety concerns.</p>
<h2>Energy Concerns in Japan</h2>
<p>Japan's operator of the world's largest nuclear power plant suspended its operation just hours after a restart. Officials stated that the reactor remains stable with no radioactive impact reported outside the facility. The suspension reflects the ongoing challenges and public sensitivity surrounding nuclear energy management.</p>
<h2>Cultural Highlight: Oscar Nominations</h2>
<p>The vampire-themed horror film *Sinners* set a new record with 16 Oscar nominations, the highest ever for a single film. This achievement marks a milestone in the entertainment industry and draws attention to the popularity of the genre in major awards competitions.</p>
