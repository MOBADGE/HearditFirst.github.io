    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, the US president addressed recent tensions over Greenland. He said he would not use force to acquire the island, stepping back from earlier tariff threats. Instead, he mentioned the possibility of negotiating a "framework of a future deal" that could lead to a long-term agreement. This marks a shift toward diplomatic engagement on the issue, although details of any potential deal remain unclear.</p>
<h2>Spy Trial in Austria</h2>
<p>A major espionage trial is underway in Austria, involving Egisto Ott, a 63-year-old former intelligence officer. He faces charges of passing information to Russian agents, accusations he denies. This case is the country’s largest spy trial in years and highlights ongoing concerns about foreign espionage activities in Europe.</p>
<h2>US Congressional Testimony: Ghislaine Maxwell</h2>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted in a high-profile sex trafficking case, is set to testify before the US Congress as part of an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s activities. Maxwell has previously indicated she may refuse to answer questions unless granted immunity. Her testimony could provide new insights into the Epstein case and broader issues related to sex trafficking networks.</p>
<h2>Natural Disaster in New Zealand</h2>
<p>A landslide struck a campsite in Mount Maunganui, a popular tourist area in New Zealand. Several people remain missing following the incident. A tourist who witnessed the event described the experience as terrifying and said, “I’m still shaking.” Rescue efforts are ongoing, and the situation remains serious for those affected and their families.</p>
<h2>Space and Science</h2>
<p>Russian cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov has shared stunning footage of an aurora from space. The visuals coincide with one of the largest solar storms seen in over 20 years. Such storms can affect Earth’s magnetic field and communications systems, making Kud-Sverchkov’s footage notable both for its beauty and scientific relevance.</p>
