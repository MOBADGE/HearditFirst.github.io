    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine carried out drone strikes on two tankers in the Black Sea, targeting vessels thought to be involved in bypassing Western sanctions on Russia. This marks an escalation in the ongoing conflict involving Russia and Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia launched overnight attacks causing power outages for more than 600,000 people in Ukraine, resulting in at least three deaths and dozens of injuries.</p>
<p>In Gaza, the health ministry run by Hamas reported that more than 70,000 people have been killed since the Israeli offensive began. Despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations, Israeli air strikes continue, with two young brothers among the recent casualties.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing a significant political shake-up as Andriy Yermak, considered the country’s second most powerful figure, resigned amid a widening corruption scandal. His departure could represent either a reboot for Kyiv’s leadership or a disruptive change during a critical period in the conflict with Russia.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Religion</h2>
<p>Pope Leo made a historic visit to Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, marking the first time since becoming pope in May that he attended a Muslim place of worship. This visit is seen as a step toward interfaith dialogue and strengthening relations between Christian and Muslim communities.</p>
<h2>Domestic News: Australia and Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese became the first sitting Australian prime minister to get married, tying the knot with Jodie Haydon. The couple were engaged last year on Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, three days of mourning began following the city’s deadliest fire in decades. The blaze destroyed several tower blocks, leaving at least 128 people dead and hundreds missing.</p>
<h2>Aviation and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Air travel disruptions are easing after a warning from Airbus grounded around 6,000 planes due to a data corruption issue. Flights are gradually returning to normal as the problem is addressed and resolved.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security in Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, a recent wave of kidnappings involving over 250 schoolchildren has sparked debate over responsibility. While authorities blame jihadist groups, analysts suggest that criminal gangs are more likely behind the abductions, highlighting the complex security challenges in the region.</p>
