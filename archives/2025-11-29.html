    <h2>International Tensions Over Venezuela Airspace</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has declared that the airspace around Venezuela should be considered fully closed. This announcement has drawn strong criticism from Venezuela, which described the warning as a "colonialist threat." The move signals heightened tensions between the two countries and could impact diplomatic and economic relations.</p>
<h2>Severe Flooding in Southern Asia</h2>
<p>Southern Asia is experiencing some of its worst flooding in recent years, with millions affected across Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. The floods have caused at least 600 deaths, leaving communities struggling with extensive damage and displacement. Relief efforts are underway, but the region faces ongoing challenges due to the scale of the disaster.</p>
<h2>Leadership Changes in Ukraine Amid Corruption Scandal</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s political landscape has been shaken by the resignation of Andriy Yermak, widely regarded as the country’s second most powerful figure, following a corruption scandal. This development raises questions about whether Kyiv will see a reset in leadership approach or if the shake-up could be costly politically as the country continues to face internal and external pressures.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Mourns Deadliest Fire in Decades</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has entered three days of mourning after a devastating fire destroyed multiple tower blocks. At least 128 people have died, and hundreds remain missing. The tragedy marks the deadliest fire in the city’s recent history, prompting widespread grief and calls for investigations into building safety standards.</p>
<h2>Flights Resume After Airbus Safety Concern</h2>
<p>Air travel disruptions are easing after nearly 6,000 planes were grounded due to a data corruption issue discovered by Airbus. Airlines are gradually returning to normal operations as the problem is addressed, reducing the widespread travel delays and cancellations that affected passengers worldwide.</p>
<h2>Political and Security Developments</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, blame for the kidnapping of over 250 schoolchildren varies, with government officials pointing to jihadist groups while analysts argue criminal gangs are responsible. Meanwhile, Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras sentenced to 45 years in the US for drug trafficking, is reportedly set to be pardoned by Donald Trump, highlighting ongoing complex political dynamics related to crime and justice in the region.</p>
