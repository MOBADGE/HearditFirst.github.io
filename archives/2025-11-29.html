    <h2>Ukraine Faces Leadership Change Amid Corruption Scandal</h2>
<p>Ukraine's political landscape is undergoing a significant shift as Andriy Yermak, considered the country's second most powerful figure, resigned following a growing corruption scandal. Yermak's departure could signal either a fresh start for Kyiv’s leadership or lead to a disruptive shake-up amid ongoing challenges. The specific implications of this change remain to be seen, but it comes as Ukraine continues to deal with intense conflict and internal pressures.</p>
<h2>Russian Attacks Cause Widespread Power Outages in Ukraine</h2>
<p>An overnight wave of Russian strikes caused power outages affecting over 600,000 people in Ukraine. The attacks resulted in at least three deaths and dozens of injuries. These strikes target critical infrastructure, deepening the humanitarian crisis in the country and complicating efforts to maintain basic services for civilians during the ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>U.S. Suspends Asylum Decisions Following National Guard Incident</h2>
<p>The United States has suspended decisions on all asylum claims after an incident involving the National Guard. This move comes shortly after Donald Trump announced a pause on migration from certain "third-world countries." The suspension adds uncertainty for asylum seekers and underscores the ongoing debates over U.S. immigration and border policies.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Observes Three Days of Mourning After Deadly Fire</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has begun three days of mourning following its deadliest fire in decades, which killed at least 128 people and left hundreds unaccounted for. The devastating blaze engulfed several tower blocks, leading to widespread grief and calls for improved safety measures. The tragedy marks a somber moment for the city, as investigations and rescue efforts continue.</p>
<h2>Nigeria Sees Debate Over Responsibility for Mass Kidnappings</h2>
<p>A recent wave of kidnappings in Nigeria, including the abduction of more than 250 schoolchildren, has sparked controversy over who is responsible. While Nigerian authorities blame jihadist groups, some analysts argue that criminal gangs are the main perpetrators. This debate highlights the complex security challenges facing the country and the difficulty in addressing such large-scale crimes effectively.</p>
<h2>Australian Prime Minister Marries While in Office</h2>
<p>Anthony Albanese, the prime minister of Australia, has become the first sitting leader in the country to marry while in office. He wed Jodie Haydon, his fiancée since last Valentine's Day, marking a personal milestone amid his ongoing political responsibilities. The event is notable as a rare example of a national leader combining official duties with a significant personal life event.</p>
