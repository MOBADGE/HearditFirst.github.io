    <h2>Ukraine's Political Shake-up Amid Corruption Scandal</h2>
<p>Ukraine's political scene faces significant changes after Andriy Yermak, considered the country's second most powerful figure, resigned over a growing corruption scandal. Yermak's departure follows investigations that have put pressure on Kyiv's leadership. This shake-up could lead to a major reboot for Ukraine's government, coming at a critical time during ongoing conflict challenges and geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>Russian Attacks Disrupt Ukraine’s Power Supply</h2>
<p>In parallel with political unrest, Ukraine was hit by overnight Russian strikes that caused power outages affecting more than 600,000 people. The attacks resulted in at least three deaths and left dozens injured. This disruption adds to the difficulties faced by civilians and authorities in maintaining essential services during the conflict.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Asylum Decisions Amid Migration Policy Shift</h2>
<p>The United States has halted all decisions on asylum claims following a recent shooting involving National Guard troops. This directive came shortly after former US President Donald Trump announced a pause on migration from "third-world countries." The policy change signals a tightening of immigration and asylum procedures, affecting migrants and asylum seekers currently in the US system.</p>
<h2>Pope Leo Visits Istanbul's Blue Mosque</h2>
<p>Pope Leo made a historic visit to Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, marking his first attendance at a Muslim place of worship since becoming pope in May. This visit is seen as a step toward fostering interfaith dialogue between Christianity and Islam. The gesture could have implications for ongoing religious and cultural conversations worldwide.</p>
<h2>Aviation Industry Recovers After Airbus Data Issue</h2>
<p>Air travel is returning to normal after a warning from Airbus grounded about 6,000 planes worldwide. The issue involved a potential data corruption problem that raised safety concerns. Airlines and regulators acted quickly to address the problem, allowing flights to resume, which is reassuring for travelers and the aviation industry during a busy season.</p>
<h2>Mourning Begins in Hong Kong After Deadly Fire</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has started three days of mourning following the city's deadliest fire in decades. The blaze engulfed multiple tower blocks, killing at least 128 people. Hundreds remain unaccounted for, and emergency services continue search and rescue efforts. The tragedy has sparked concern about building safety and emergency preparedness in the city.</p>
