    <h2>International Tensions Over Venezuela Airspace</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump declared that the airspace around Venezuela should be considered closed "in its entirety." This statement has drawn a strong response from Venezuela, which described it as a "colonialist threat." The warning escalates tensions between the two countries amid ongoing political disagreements. The move could impact regional air traffic and diplomatic relations, with potential consequences for international cooperation in the region.</p>
<h2>Severe Flooding Hits Southern Asia</h2>
<p>Southern Asia is experiencing some of its worst flooding in years, with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka heavily affected. The floods have resulted in at least 600 deaths and displaced millions of people. Emergency services and governments are engaged in rescue and relief efforts. The widespread nature of the flooding highlights the vulnerability of the region to extreme weather events, raising concerns about preparedness and climate resilience going forward.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Political Shake-Up Amid Corruption Scandal</h2>
<p>Ukraine's political scene is in turmoil after Andriy Yermak, described as the country's second most powerful figure, resigned due to a widening corruption scandal. The resignation marks a significant shake-up within Kyiv's leadership. It remains to be seen whether this will lead to a political reboot strengthening governance or if it will deepen instability during a critical period for the country.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Mourns After Deadly Fire</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has begun three days of mourning after a tragic fire engulfed several tower blocks, resulting in at least 128 deaths. Hundreds more people remain unaccounted for. This is the deadliest fire in the city in decades. Authorities are continuing search and rescue efforts while investigating the cause. The disaster has profoundly affected the community and sparked calls for improved fire safety measures.</p>
<h2>Air Travel Disruption Eases After Airbus Warning</h2>
<p>Flights affected by a technical issue discovered by Airbus are now returning to normal. Around 6,000 planes were grounded after a potential data corruption problem was identified. The resolution of this issue comes as good news for travelers and airlines worldwide, reducing delays and cancellations that had disrupted schedules. Industry watchers continue to monitor for any further safety developments.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Updates</h2>
