    <h2>US Halts Asylum Claim Decisions Following National Guard Shooting</h2>
<p>The United States government has paused all decisions on asylum claims. This directive comes shortly after a shooting incident involving members of the National Guard in Washington DC. A 20-year-old woman, Sarah Beckstrom, died in the attack, while a 24-year-old man, Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition. The timing also coincides with Donald Trump announcing a pause on migration from what he described as "third-world countries." The halt on asylum decisions may affect many people seeking refuge, potentially increasing delays and uncertainty for those awaiting immigration outcomes.</p>
<h2>Aircraft Grounded Due to Solar Radiation Risks</h2>
<p>Airbus has identified a safety issue affecting around 6,000 airplanes. Solar radiation has been found to potentially disrupt the systems on these aircraft, raising concerns about flight safety. As a result, affected planes are being grounded temporarily to receive urgent software updates or to have certain onboard computers replaced. This precaution aims to prevent technical failures associated with radiation exposure. The measures could impact flight schedules and airline operations globally until all necessary changes are applied and verified.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Hong Kong Prompts Three Days of Mourning</h2>
<p>Hong Kong is observing three days of mourning following its deadliest fire in decades. The blaze engulfed several tower blocks, resulting in at least 128 confirmed deaths, with hundreds more unaccounted for. The scale of the tragedy has shocked the city and prompted calls for investigations into fire safety and emergency response measures. The mourning period reflects the community’s grief and the extensive impact on families affected by the disaster.</p>
<h2>Kidnappings in Nigeria: Conflicting Blame and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, more than 250 schoolchildren were kidnapped last week, sparking concern and debate over the responsible parties. The government has blamed jihadist groups for the wave of abductions, while some analysts argue that criminal gangs are behind the incidents. This divide highlights ongoing challenges in addressing security and law enforcement in the region. The kidnappings raise fears about the safety of children and the stability of affected communities, with calls for stronger measures to prevent future attacks.</p>
<h2>Trump Announces Pardon for Former Honduras President</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, the former Honduras president. Hernández was convicted in the United States and sentenced to 45 years in prison for conspiracy related to cocaine smuggling. The planned pardon has drawn attention due to the seriousness of the conviction and Hernández’s role in Honduras politics. The move may have legal and diplomatic implications, fueling debate about accountability and political influence in international criminal cases.</p>
