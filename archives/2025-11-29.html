    <h2>Ukraine Political Shake-Up</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s second most influential figure, Andriy Yermak, has resigned amid a growing corruption scandal. Yermak’s departure marks a significant political shake-up in Kyiv, the capital, coming at a time when the country faces ongoing military and political challenges. His exit could lead to a reboot of Ukraine’s leadership approach, but it also risks destabilizing internal politics during a critical period.</p>
<h2>Renewed Russian Attacks in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russian strikes overnight have caused power outages affecting over 600,000 people in Ukraine. The attacks resulted in at least three deaths and dozens of injuries. These strikes add to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian challenges in the region, exacerbating the strain on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and emergency services.</p>
<h2>US Migration Policy Update</h2>
<p>The United States has paused all decisions on asylum claims following a shooting incident involving the National Guard. This move happened shortly after former US leader Donald Trump announced plans to halt migration from what he termed "third-world countries." The temporary halt reflects heightened tensions and uncertainty around US immigration policies, potentially impacting many seeking asylum in the country.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters in Asia and Hong Kong Mourning</h2>
<p>Severe flooding has devastated parts of southern Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. These floods are among the worst in recent years and have affected millions of people while causing hundreds of deaths. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has entered three days of mourning after a deadly fire swept through multiple tower blocks, killing at least 128 people and leaving hundreds unaccounted for. Both crises highlight ongoing vulnerabilities to natural and urban disasters in the region.</p>
<h2>Aviation and International Relations</h2>
<p>Air travel disruptions are easing as flights resume after a major Airbus warning grounded about 6,000 planes worldwide. The problem involved an issue that could corrupt data on aircraft systems, leading to widespread cancellations and delays. This update brings relief to travelers and airlines and until the issue is fully resolved, monitoring continues.</p>
<p>In a notable interfaith event, Pope Leo visited Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, marking his first attendance at a Muslim place of worship since becoming pope earlier this year. The visit is seen as a gesture toward fostering dialogue and cooperation between religious communities.</p>
<h2>Other Headlines</h2>
<p>In Australia, Anthony Albanese became the first prime minister to marry while in office, tying the knot with Jodie Haydon after their engagement last year. In Nigeria, the government attributes a recent wave of kidnappings to jihadist groups, though analysts suggest criminal gangs are responsible, especially for the recent abduction of over 250 schoolchildren. Lastly, former Honduras president Juan Orlando Hernández, sentenced in the US for drug trafficking, is set to be pardoned by Donald Trump, a decision likely to generate political debate.</p>
