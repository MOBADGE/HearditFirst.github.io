    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">November 29, 2025</div>
    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>A serious overnight attack in Kyiv has left more than 600,000 residents without power. The Russian strikes killed at least three people in the Ukrainian capital. The widespread power outages are disrupting daily life and highlight the ongoing dangers faced by civilians amid the conflict. How Ukraine and its partners respond to these attacks will be closely watched in the coming days.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, more than 250 schoolchildren were kidnapped last week. The government blamed jihadist groups, but analysts suggest that criminal gangs are behind the wave of kidnappings. This discrepancy points to the complexity of security challenges facing the country as it tries to safeguard vulnerable populations.</p>
<h2>United States: Policy and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>The US government has halted all asylum claim decisions following a shooting involving the National Guard. This directive came shortly after President Donald Trump announced a pause on migration from "third-world countries." The suspension will affect many asylum seekers and could lead to longer processing times, raising concerns about the future of US immigration policy.</p>
<p>Separately, Donald Trump said he plans to pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras. Hernández was sentenced to 45 years in a US prison for conspiracy in cocaine smuggling. The move, if it proceeds, will draw attention to ongoing debates over justice and diplomatic relations in the region.</p>
<h2>Aviation and Technology</h2>
<p>Airbus has grounded about 6,000 planes after discovering that solar radiation could affect some onboard systems. The affected aircraft will require urgent software updates or computer replacements to address this safety concern. This development could cause significant delays in air travel and raises questions about how increasing solar activity may impact aviation technology.</p>
<h2>Tragedy and Mourning in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has entered three days of mourning after its deadliest fire in decades. The blaze engulfed several tower blocks, killing at least 128 people, with hundreds still unaccounted for. The scale of the tragedy has shocked the city and will likely lead to investigations into safety regulations and emergency preparedness.</p>
<h2>Cultural Highlights and Personal News</h2>
<p>As the festive season approaches, a reporter searched for authentic Christmas markets in the UK and Germany, exploring which venues best capture the traditional spirit of the holiday. The story offers a look at how different cultures celebrate and what makes a Christmas market truly special.</p>
<p>On a personal note, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has become the first leader of that country to marry while in office. He wed Jodie Haydon, with whom he became engaged last year. This event adds a human interest dimension to political life in Australia.</p>
