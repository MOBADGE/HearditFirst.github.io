    <div class="date">November 29, 2025</div>
    <h2>Severe Flooding Hits Southern Asia</h2>
<p>Heavy rains have caused some of the worst flooding in years across parts of southern Asia. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka are all affected, with millions of people impacted by rising waters. At least 600 deaths have been reported so far. The floods have damaged homes, infrastructure, and farmland, leading to widespread disruption. Relief and recovery efforts will likely be needed for months to help the communities recover.</p>
<h2>Political and Conflict Developments</h2>
<p>Ukraine's political scene faces a significant shake-up as Andriy Yermak, described as the country’s second most powerful person, has resigned amid a growing corruption scandal. His departure raises questions about the future political direction of Kyiv and whether this turmoil will affect governance and ongoing conflict efforts.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, Russian forces conducted overnight strikes that caused power outages for more than 600,000 people. The attacks killed at least three individuals and injured dozens, exacerbating challenges for civilians amid the ongoing conflict.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, over 250 schoolchildren were kidnapped last week. While officials blame jihadist groups, analysts point to criminal gangs as the main culprits. The situation highlights continuing security challenges in the region and raises concerns about safety and law enforcement responses.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump made controversial remarks suggesting the airspace around Venezuela should be considered closed. Although the US cannot legally enforce such a closure, his comments may discourage airlines from flying there, potentially impacting travel and diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Trump also announced plans to pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras. Hernández is currently serving a 45-year prison sentence in the US for drug trafficking conspiracy related to smuggling cocaine. The pardon decision may have international and legal repercussions.</p>
<h2>Notable Visits and Historic Moments</h2>
<p>Pope Leo visited Istanbul's Blue Mosque, marking his first time attending a Muslim place of worship since becoming pope in May. This visit reflects ongoing efforts to build interfaith dialogue and foster better relations between religious communities.</p>
<p>In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese made history by becoming the first Australian prime minister to marry while in office. He wed Jodie Haydon, with whom he got engaged on Valentine's Day last year. The ceremony is notable but does not affect his political duties.</p>
<h2>Transportation Returns to Normal</h2>
<p>Air travel disruptions caused by an Airbus warning are easing. About 6,000 planes were temporarily grounded due to a software problem that could corrupt data. Airlines and regulators are now working to resume normal flight schedules after addressing the issue, helping reduce travel delays and inconvenience for passengers.</p>
<h2>Mourning After Deadly Fire in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has entered three days of mourning following a fire that killed at least 128 people and left hundreds missing. The blaze swept through several tower blocks, marking one of the deadliest fires in the city’s recent history. Emergency services continue searching for survivors and investigating the cause of the fire. The community is focused on supporting victims and reviewing safety measures to prevent future tragedies.</p>
