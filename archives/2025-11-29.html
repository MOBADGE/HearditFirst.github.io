    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">November 29, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and US Policy</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has urged airlines to treat Venezuelan airspace as closed, despite the US lacking legal authority to close another nation's airspace. His remarks are seen as potentially deterring airlines from operating in Venezuela, raising concerns about diplomatic and aviation implications. In another development related to US foreign relations, Trump announced plans to pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, a former Honduras leader sentenced in the US to 45 years for cocaine smuggling. This move could affect US-Honduras relations and the broader fight against drug trafficking.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Crises and Disasters</h2>
<p>Severe flooding across southern Asia has resulted in at least 600 deaths, affecting millions in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. These are among the worst floods in years for the region, prompting urgent humanitarian needs and responses. In Hong Kong, at least 128 people died in the city’s deadliest fire in decades, which engulfed multiple tower blocks. Authorities have started a three-day mourning period while hundreds remain unaccounted for, highlighting the scale of the disaster and the recovery challenges ahead.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Developments</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing significant political upheaval as Andriy Yermak, described as the country’s second most powerful figure, resigned amid a growing corruption scandal. This shake-up could lead to political reforms or could destabilize governance during a critical time. Concurrently, Russia conducted strikes in Ukraine causing power outages affecting more than 600,000 people, killing at least three and injuring dozens. These attacks have compounded the difficulties Ukraine faces amid ongoing conflict and infrastructure damage.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security Concerns in Nigeria</h2>
<p>Nigeria is grappling with a recent wave of kidnappings involving more than 250 schoolchildren. While Nigerian authorities blame jihadist groups, analysts argue criminal gangs are responsible. This contrast in attribution affects how the security situation is understood and what measures might be taken to address ongoing instability and protect civilians.</p>
<h2>Notable Events and Social Developments</h2>
<p>Pope Leo made his first visit to a Muslim place of worship since becoming pope, attending Istanbul’s Blue Mosque. This visit is notable for its gesture toward interfaith dialogue and religious diplomacy. Meanwhile, in Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese became the first sitting leader to get married while in office, tying the knot with Jodie Haydon. This personal milestone for the prime minister attracted public attention but is largely a symbolic event.</p>
<h2>Aviation Industry Update</h2>
<p>The aviation sector is recovering after an Airbus warning grounded about 6,000 planes due to a technical issue that risked corrupting data. Flights are now returning to normal schedules as the problem is addressed, easing disruptions for travelers worldwide and restoring airline operations.</p>
