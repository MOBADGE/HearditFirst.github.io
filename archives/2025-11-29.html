    <h2>International Tensions Over Venezuela Airspace</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump announced that the airspace around Venezuela should be "considered closed in its entirety." Venezuela responded by condemning the warning, calling it a "colonialist threat." This escalation highlights ongoing tensions between the two countries. Closure of airspace could affect international flights and diplomatic relations, potentially leading to further confrontation or negotiations.</p>
<h2>Severe Flooding Devastates Southern Asia</h2>
<p>Southern Asia faces one of its worst flood events in recent years. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka are among the countries affected, with millions of people impacted by heavy rains and rising waters. At least 600 deaths have been reported due to the flooding. The disaster underscores the region’s vulnerability to extreme weather and may prompt changes in emergency response and infrastructure planning.</p>
<h2>Political Shake-Up in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Andriy Yermak, identified as Ukraine’s second most powerful person, resigned amid a growing corruption scandal. His departure represents a significant political shake-up for Kyiv. The resignation raises questions about how the Ukrainian government will address corruption and maintain stability, especially given ongoing challenges the country faces.</p>
<h2>Pope Visits Blue Mosque in Istanbul</h2>
<p>Pope Leo made a historic visit to Istanbul's Blue Mosque, marking the first time he has attended a Muslim place of worship since becoming pope in May. This visit symbolizes a step toward interfaith dialogue and may influence ongoing efforts to improve relations between the Catholic Church and Muslim communities.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Mourns After Deadly Fire</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has begun three days of mourning following its deadliest fire in decades, which claimed at least 128 lives and left hundreds unaccounted for. The fire engulfed multiple tower blocks, causing widespread devastation. Authorities and residents are grappling with the aftermath and searching for survivors while investigating the cause.</p>
<h2>Flight Disruptions Ease Following Airbus Warning</h2>
<p>Flight operations are returning to normal after a warning about an Airbus issue led to the grounding of approximately 6,000 planes. The problem involved a technical difficulty that could corrupt data, prompting precautionary measures by airlines and regulators. The resolution allows air travel to resume more smoothly, though the incident highlights the need for ongoing vigilance in aircraft safety.</p>
