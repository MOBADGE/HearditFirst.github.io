    <h2>International Security</h2>
<p>The United States conducted deadly military strikes targeting the Islamic State group in Nigeria. The US president accused the group of killing Christians in the region. However, Nigeria’s foreign minister described the operation as a "joint operation" between the two countries and emphasized that it was not motivated by religious reasons. This collaboration highlights ongoing efforts to combat extremist violence in West Africa, with potential implications for regional security and US involvement abroad.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in the US</h2>
<p>A US judge has blocked the detention of Imran Ahmed, a British social media campaigner. Ahmed was one of five individuals accused of attempting to "coerce" US companies into censoring free speech online. This decision raises important questions about the limits of legal authority over international activists and the balance between combating harmful content and protecting freedom of expression on social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Cultural Controversy in Crimea</h2>
<p>Debate has emerged around the case of a prominent Russian archaeologist wanted for prosecution in Ukraine. The scholar’s work in occupied Crimea has drawn attention to tensions between the role of museums and the Russian state. The situation underscores broader geopolitical conflicts affecting cultural heritage and the complexities of conducting research in contested regions. The outcome of this case could influence international discussions about archaeology in disputed territories.</p>
