    <h2>International Security</h2>
<p>The United States has conducted airstrikes against the Islamic State in Nigeria. This military action targets jihadist groups active in the region. Earlier, former US President Donald Trump criticized the Nigerian government for not adequately protecting Christian communities from such militant threats. The strikes represent an ongoing effort by the US to counter extremism in West Africa and support regional security.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Ukraine's leader expressed optimism following recent discussions with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The talks centered on new proposals for peace, which Ukraine’s leader described as bringing "new ideas". This positive assessment may signal potential progress toward resolving the conflict affecting the region, although details of the proposals have not been disclosed.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in the US</h2>
<p>A US judge has blocked the detention of Imran Ahmed, a British social media campaigner. Ahmed was one of five individuals accused of attempting to pressure US companies into censoring speech online. The ruling prevents immediate detention, highlighting ongoing legal debates about free speech, social media regulation, and the limits of corporate influence.</p>
<h2>Cultural Heritage and Conflict</h2>
<p>A debate has arisen over whether a prominent Russian archaeologist should face trial for conducting excavations in Crimea, a region currently under Russian control but internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. The situation raises complex questions about the role of museums and scholars amid geopolitical disputes. The case underscores tensions between cultural preservation and national sovereignty in contested territories.</p>
