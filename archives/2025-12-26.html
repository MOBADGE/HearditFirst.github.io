    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 26, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>The United States launched airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Nigeria, targeting jihadist militants in the region. This comes amid ongoing concerns about the Nigerian government’s ability to protect vulnerable communities. Former President Trump had previously criticized Nigeria for failing to shield Christians from attacks by jihadist groups.</p>
<p>In Syria, a blast at a mosque in the city of Homs resulted in the deaths of at least eight people. The explosion took place in a predominantly Alawite neighborhood, a group that has experienced violence and crackdowns following the fall of former leader Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Israel, two people were killed in an attack involving a vehicle ramming and stabbing. The attacker, reported to be from the occupied West Bank, ran over one victim and stabbed another several miles away, according to police.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Developments</h2>
<p>Israel officially recognized Somaliland as an independent state. This move has been met with strong opposition from Somalia, Egypt, Turkey, and Djibouti, who warned that the recognition sets a dangerous precedent in the region. The acknowledgment of Somaliland’s independence could influence future diplomatic alignments and regional stability.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Conflicts in Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Fighting has continued along the Thailand-Cambodia border despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations. Cambodia has accused Thailand of carrying out "indiscriminate attacks" in the border area. Negotiators from both countries are meeting for a third day to try to resolve the renewed clashes, which have persisted for several weeks.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political News</h2>
<p>Najib Razak, the former prime minister of Malaysia, was sentenced to 15 years in prison in connection with a massive corruption scandal involving the sovereign wealth fund 1MDB. This marks a significant development in the long-running case against Najib, who was convicted for his role in the misuse of billions of dollars in state funds.</p>
<p>In the United States, a judge blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed. Ahmed had been accused, along with others, of attempting to pressure American companies into censoring content online. The judge’s decision prevents Ahmed’s detention while the case proceeds.</p>
<h2>Environment and Society</h2>
<p>In California, heavy rain has lessened but concerns remain about flooding and mudslides. Forecasters warn that even small amounts of additional rain could trigger dangerous conditions in areas already saturated by previous downpours. Residents and authorities remain vigilant as the risk of natural disasters continues.</p>
<h2>Culture and Controversy</h2>
<p>A debate has emerged over whether a top Russian archaeologist should face trial for conducting excavations in Crimea, a territory currently under dispute. The case raises wider questions about the relationship between museums, archaeological work, and state politics in contested areas. The controversy reflects ongoing tensions surrounding Crimea and its cultural heritage.</p>
