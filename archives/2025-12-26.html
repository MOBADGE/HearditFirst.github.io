    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet US President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday to discuss ways to end the war with Russia. Zelensky expressed optimism that "a lot can be decided before the new year," highlighting the urgency of resolving the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, Israel has officially recognized Somaliland as an independent state. This move was announced by Benjamin Netanyahu and has drawn condemnation from Somalia, Egypt, Turkey, and Djibouti, who warn it could set a "dangerous precedent."</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Violence continues in several regions. In Syria, a blast struck a mosque in Homs during Friday prayers, killing at least eight people. The explosion targeted a predominantly Alawite area, a sect that has experienced ongoing violence since the fall of former-President Bashar al-Assad. In Israel, two people were killed in an attack involving a car ramming and stabbing. Police say the attacker came from the occupied West Bank and targeted victims in different locations several miles apart.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the US launched air strikes against the Islamic State group. President Trump has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks, underlining the international concern about the security situation there. Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia, fighting between Thailand and Cambodia persists despite ceasefire talks. Cambodia accused Thailand of "indiscriminate attacks" near the border as negotiators met for a third day to seek a peaceful resolution.</p>
<h2>Justice and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In Malaysia, former Prime Minister Najib Razak has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund scandal. The conviction relates to his role in a billion-dollar corruption case that has drawn significant international attention.</p>
<p>In the United States, a judge blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed. Ahmed, along with four others, had been accused of trying to pressure US companies into censoring content, raising complex issues about free speech and regulation on digital platforms.</p>
<h2>Environment and Safety</h2>
<p>In California, heavy rainfall has eased, but the risk of flooding and mudslides remains high. Forecasters warned that even small amounts of additional rain could trigger hazardous conditions due to already saturated ground. Residents are advised to stay alert as recovery and emergency response efforts continue.</p>
<h2>Culture and Heritage</h2>
<p>A debate has emerged around a Russian archaeologist wanted in Ukraine, raising broader questions about the ties between museums and the Russian state. The case involves the scholar’s archaeological work in occupied Crimea, a contested territory, and reflects ongoing tensions over cultural heritage and national identity in the region.</p>
