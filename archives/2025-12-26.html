<p>The United States has carried out airstrikes targeting Islamic State militants in Nigeria. The US president described the strikes as a response to attacks by the group against Christian communities. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s foreign minister emphasized that the operation was a coordinated effort between the two countries and insisted it was not motivated by religious reasons. This cooperation highlights ongoing international efforts to combat extremist groups in the region and aims to curb violence impacting civilian populations.</p>
