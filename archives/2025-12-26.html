    <h2>International Security: US Conducts Strikes Against Islamic State in Nigeria</h2>
<p>The United States has carried out military strikes targeting the Islamic State group in Nigeria. The US president stated the action was in response to the group’s violence against Christians. Nigeria’s foreign minister clarified to the BBC that the strikes were part of a joint effort between the US and Nigerian forces, emphasizing that the operation was not motivated by religious reasons. This development highlights ongoing international cooperation in countering extremist groups in West Africa and could affect the security landscape in the region going forward.</p>
<h2>Cultural Heritage and Legal Disputes: Russian Archaeologist Sought by Ukraine</h2>
<p>A prominent Russian archaeologist is at the center of a controversy related to archaeological work conducted in Crimea, which is currently under Russian control but claimed by Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities want to put the scholar on trial. The case raises broader questions about the role museums and cultural institutions play in geopolitics, especially in contested areas. This dispute underscores the complexities that arise when heritage sites become entangled with national and international legal and political conflicts, and it may influence future cooperation or tensions between the two countries in cultural affairs.</p>
