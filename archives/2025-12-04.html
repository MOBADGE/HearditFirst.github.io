    <h2>Geopolitics and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is visiting India for a two-day trip aimed at strengthening oil, defence, and political ties between the two countries. This visit reflects the growing importance of India as a strategic partner for Russia amid shifting global alliances and economic challenges. The outcomes of this visit could impact energy supplies and defence cooperation in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, peace talks related to the conflict in Ukraine are continuing. US special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Miami following earlier discussions in Moscow. These talks come amid ongoing tensions and highlight efforts to reach a diplomatic resolution.</p>
<p>In Africa, US involvement in conflict resolution continues with plans for a signing event hosted by the US president, aimed at formalising a peace deal between leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The deal is intended to stabilize the resource-rich region and potentially open it up to increased American investment.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Media</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has started disabling accounts of Australian users under the age of 16 ahead of an official ban set to take effect soon. This move responds to regulatory pressures aimed at protecting children’s online safety by limiting their access to social media platforms.</p>
<p>In South Korea, concerns about stalking and violence against women have prompted the development of a new smartphone app designed to show users the real-time locations of potential stalkers. The app aims to enhance the safety of women and raise awareness about this persistent social issue.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Singapore, the country’s court upheld a guilty verdict against opposition leader Pritam Singh, who had appealed over a 2021 conviction for lying to a parliamentary committee. The decision maintains the legal judgment and may influence the political landscape in Singapore.</p>
<p>Significant reactions have emerged in the United States following controversial remarks made by the US president about the Somali-American community. Many in this community have expressed increased fear and concern in response to the intensified criticism, reflecting ongoing tensions around identity and inclusion.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Crime</h2>
<p>Newly released, previously unseen images of Jeffrey Epstein’s island have come to light amid an approaching deadline for the broader release of government-held documents related to the case. These materials may shed further light on the high-profile and sensitive investigations into Epstein’s activities and associations.</p>
<p>In Gaza, the remains of Suthisak Rintalak, a Thai agricultural worker held hostage, were returned by Palestinian groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The recovery of the body is a significant development in the ongoing conflict and hostage situation in the region.</p>
<h2>Business and Entertainment</h2>
<p>A court ruling has favoured Adidas in an appeal concerning its collaboration with rapper Kanye West. Investors had accused Adidas of misleading them as the relationship with West encountered difficulties. The court’s decision is expected to affect both parties and investor confidence in their partnership.</p>
