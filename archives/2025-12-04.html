    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that Russia plans to take control of the Donbas region either by force or as a result of Ukrainian troop withdrawals. This comes as new rounds of negotiations between US and Ukrainian officials are scheduled, indicating ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict diplomatically. Putin’s assertive remarks highlight continued tensions in the region and the challenges facing peace talks.</p>
<h2>Putin’s Visit to India</h2>
<p>Putin has begun a two-day visit to India, centered on discussions of oil, defense, and geopolitics. Experts note that both countries have strategic interests in strengthening ties, particularly given the complexities of global energy markets and defense cooperation. This visit may shape future economic and security partnerships between Russia and India amid shifting international alliances.</p>
<h2>Escalation in Middle East and Gaza Developments</h2>
<p>In Gaza, Yasser Abu Shabab, a leader of an anti-Hamas militia called the Popular Forces, was shot dead. The group has clarified that his death resulted from a family dispute rather than actions by Hamas, underlining ongoing internal conflicts within Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon hours after Israeli and Lebanese civilian envoys met for direct talks — the first in decades — signaling fragile and complex regional dynamics.</p>
<p>In addition, the body of Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer and the last hostage not yet returned by Hamas, remains in Gaza. His parents expressed solidarity with all Israeli citizens, underscoring the human toll of the conflict. Efforts are also underway in Gaza to clear rubble and begin restoration of war-damaged cultural heritage sites, although Israeli restrictions on construction materials are impeding recovery work.</p>
<h2>International Peace Efforts in Africa</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump facilitated the signing of a peace agreement between leaders from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The agreement aims to promote stability in the resource-rich region and potentially increase American investment. This diplomatic development may contribute to improved regional security and economic opportunities.</p>
<h2>Other News Highlights</h2>
<p>An incorrect earthquake alert was issued for Nevada, reaching as far as California before being retracted, causing momentary concern among residents in the affected areas.</p>
<p>In the United States, a suspect has been arrested in connection with pipe bombs found on the eve of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. These bombs were discovered as rioters began storming the Capitol building, linking the suspect to a significant and still-impacting event in recent US history.</p>
<h2>Cultural Boycott at Eurovision</h2>
<p>Ireland and several other countries have announced a boycott of the Eurovision Song Contest due to Israel’s participation amid ongoing conflict in Gaza. Concerns include the political implications of Israel’s presence and accusations of unfair voting practices, reflecting how international cultural events are intersecting with geopolitical disputes.</p>
