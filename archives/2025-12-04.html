    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 04, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Geopolitics</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun a two-day visit to India, focusing on key areas such as oil, defence, and broader geopolitical ties. This visit highlights Russia’s ongoing efforts to strengthen its strategic partnership with India amid shifting global alliances. The talks are expected to address energy cooperation, military supplies, and ways to deepen economic and political collaboration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, peace efforts continue in East Africa as the US is set to host leaders from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda for a signing ceremony of a new peace deal. The US president hopes the agreement will lead to stability and open opportunities for increased American investment in this resource-rich region.</p>
<h2>Peace Talks and Conflict</h2>
<p>In ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict involving Ukraine and Russia, US special envoy Steve Witkoff will meet with senior Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Miami for follow-up talks. This meeting follows recent discussions in Moscow and aims to advance diplomatic efforts amid the conflict. The outcome could influence the course of the region’s peace process.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Israel announced that Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, returned the body of Suthisak Rintalak, a Thai agricultural worker held hostage in Gaza. This development may impact ongoing tensions and humanitarian considerations in the area.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Issues</h2>
<p>South Korea is developing a new app designed to provide real-time alerts on the locations of stalkers. This initiative addresses growing public concern about stalking and violence against women in the country. Authorities hope the app will enhance personal safety and help prevent crimes related to stalking.</p>
<p>In another technology-related update, Meta has started disabling Instagram and Facebook accounts for users under 16 years old in Australia, ahead of an official ban set to take effect shortly. This move reflects increasing regulatory scrutiny and a push to protect younger users from potential harms on social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Singapore, the court has upheld a guilty verdict against opposition leader Pritam Singh, who was found guilty of lying to a parliamentary committee in 2021. Singh had appealed the decision, but the ruling confirms the earlier judgment. This outcome may affect the political landscape and public trust in governance.</p>
<p>Another legal ruling emerged from the fashion and business world, where a court sided with Adidas in a dispute involving its collaboration with rapper Kanye West. Investors had accused Adidas of misleading them after signs of strain appeared in the partnership. The court’s decision may influence future brand collaborations and investor confidence.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Social Concerns</h2>
<p>Somali-Americans have expressed growing fear and concern following repeated critical comments by the US president towards their community. The remarks, described as "not becoming of a president," have heightened anxieties among Somali-Americans about their safety and social acceptance in the United States. This group’s response underscores ongoing challenges related to community relations and political rhetoric.</p>
<p>Finally, a new set of previously unseen images of Jeffrey Epstein's island has been released in the US. This comes as a deadline approaches for a broader release of government-held documents related to the case. The images and documents could provide more insight into the investigations and public understanding of the circumstances surrounding Epstein.</p>
