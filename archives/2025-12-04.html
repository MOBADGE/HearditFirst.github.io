    <div class="date">December 04, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Diplomacy and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun a two-day visit to India, focusing on key issues such as oil, defense, and geopolitical relations. This visit underscores the ongoing strategic partnership between the two countries amid shifting global alliances.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Great Lakes region of Africa, a peace deal between the leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda is set to be signed. The event will be hosted by the US president, who views the agreement as a step toward enhancing American investment in this resource-rich area, signifying potential economic and regional stability improvements.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and US Negotiations</h2>
<p>Negotiations related to the conflict in Ukraine continue, with US special envoy Steve Witkoff scheduled to meet Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Miami. This follows talks held in Moscow and represents ongoing diplomatic efforts to find a path forward amid the prolonged conflict.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In South Korea, authorities are developing a new app designed to show the real-time location of stalkers. This initiative responds to widespread concerns about stalking and violence against women, aiming to increase personal safety through technological means.</p>
<p>On the other side of the world, Meta has begun closing Instagram and Facebook accounts for users under 16 in Australia. This move precedes an official ban set to take effect soon and reflects growing global scrutiny of social media impacts on children.</p>
<h2>Legal and Judicial Updates</h2>
<p>Singapore’s court has upheld the guilty verdict against opposition leader Pritam Singh, who was found guilty in 2021 of lying to a parliamentary committee. The ruling ends his appeal and has implications for political accountability in the country.</p>
<p>In the business world, a court has sided with Adidas in an appeal concerning its collaboration with rapper Kanye West. Investors had accused Adidas of misleading them as tensions surfaced in the partnership, but the decision favors the sportswear company.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict</h2>
<p>Israel has announced that Palestinian groups returned the body of Thai agricultural worker Suthisak Rintalak, who had been held hostage in Gaza. The remains were recovered from factions Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in northern Gaza, highlighting the ongoing human toll in the region.</p>
<p>Additionally, Somali-Americans in the United States have expressed fear following intensified criticism from the US president, who referred to the community in derogatory terms. This has heightened concerns about discrimination and community safety among Somali-Americans.</p>
<h2>Newly Released Documents</h2>
<p>In the US, previously unseen images of Jeffrey Epstein’s island have been made public as a deadline approaches for a broader release of government-held documents. These materials may shed more light on ongoing investigations related to Epstein’s activities and associates.</p>
