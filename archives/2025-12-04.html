    <h2>Global Politics and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun a two-day visit to India, focusing on strengthening ties related to oil, defence, and geopolitics. This visit highlights the importance of Russia-India relations amid shifting global alliances and energy needs. Meanwhile, US special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to meet with senior Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Miami for talks following discussions in Moscow. These meetings reflect ongoing diplomatic efforts surrounding the conflict in Ukraine and the broader geopolitical balance.</p>
<p>In Africa, the US president is set to host the signing of a peace deal between leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The deal aims to end regional tensions and is expected to facilitate increased American investment in this resource-rich area, potentially stabilising the region and boosting economic development.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Israel has announced that Palestinian groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in northern Gaza returned the body of Suthisak Rintalak, a Thai agricultural worker held hostage in Gaza. The recovery of his remains marks a somber development within the context of ongoing conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Issues</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has begun removing accounts of Australian children under the age of 16 ahead of an official ban. This proactive step is part of broader efforts to address concerns about children’s safety and online privacy on social media platforms.</p>
<p>In South Korea, the government is developing an app that provides real-time location information on stalkers. This initiative comes amid growing public concern about the prevalence of stalking and violence against women, signaling a move to enhance personal safety through technology.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Developments</h2>
<p>In Singapore, a court has upheld a guilty verdict against opposition leader Pritam Singh for lying to a parliamentary committee in 2021. Singh had appealed the decision but the court maintained the original ruling, underscoring the ongoing scrutiny of political figures in the country.</p>
<p>In the United States, members of the Somali community in Minnesota are expressing heightened fear over a potential immigration crackdown. This anxiety follows increased criticism from the US president directed at the community, reflecting tensions around immigration policy and community relations.</p>
<h2>Court Rulings in Business</h2>
<p>In legal news involving the sportswear industry, a court has ruled in favour of Adidas in an appeal regarding its collaboration with rapper Kanye West. Investors had accused the company of misleading them amid strains in the partnership, but the court sided with Adidas, providing clarity on the business relationship and its legal standing.</p>
