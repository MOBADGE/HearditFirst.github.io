    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 04, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Delhi for a two-day visit to India. The visit focuses on key issues like oil, defense, and geopolitical relations. Analysts say the talks could strengthen Russia-India ties amid shifting global alliances and ongoing conflicts. This meeting highlights India's balancing act between Russia and Western countries, especially given current tensions involving Moscow.</p>
<p>In related diplomatic news, Ukrainian and US negotiators are set to meet in Miami. The talks, involving US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov, come after recent discussions in Moscow. These meetings are part of ongoing efforts to address the conflict in Ukraine and explore potential pathways to peace.</p>
<h2>Heritage and Conflict</h2>
<p>In Gaza, recovery work has begun on war-damaged heritage sites. Palestinians are clearing rubble from archaeological locations affected by recent clashes. However, efforts to restore these sites face challenges due to Israeli restrictions on the import of building materials. This situation underscores the difficulty of preserving cultural landmarks amid ongoing political and military tensions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel reported that Palestinian groups returned the body of a Thai agricultural worker, Suthisak Rintalak, who was held hostage in Gaza. The remains were recovered from northern Gaza, involving Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This development may affect ongoing discussions about hostages and security in the region.</p>
<h2>Security and Justice</h2>
<p>In the United States, a suspect linked to pipe bombs placed near the Capitol ahead of the January 6 riots has been arrested, ending a years-long manhunt. The devices were found as rioters stormed the Capitol in 2021. This arrest is a significant step in addressing the events surrounding that day and ongoing security concerns in the US.</p>
<h2>Technology and Society</h2>
<p>South Korea is developing a new app that will allow users to see the real-time location of stalkers. This initiative responds to growing concerns about stalking and violence against women in the country. While the app aims to enhance personal safety, critics worry about privacy and how the technology will be implemented in practice.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Free Speech</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Instagram, confirmed it removed the social media accounts of Tanzanian activist Mange Kimambi. The activist had been mobilizing protests against election results. Meta said the account removals were due to violations of its policies. This incident contributes to ongoing debates about social media platforms' roles in political activism and free expression.</p>
