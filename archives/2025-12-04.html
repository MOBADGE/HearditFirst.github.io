    <h2>International Diplomacy and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is visiting India for two days, with discussions expected to focus on oil, defense, and broader geopolitical concerns. This visit highlights ongoing strategic ties between Russia and India amid shifting global alliances. Meanwhile, in the United States, a new round of negotiations on the Ukraine conflict is scheduled, with US special envoy Steve Witkoff meeting senior Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Miami. These talks follow earlier discussions in Moscow, signaling continued diplomatic efforts to address the conflict.</p>
<p>Separately, the US president will host a ceremony for the signing of a peace deal between leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The administration hopes this agreement will lead to increased American investment in the resource-rich region, indicating a focus on stability and economic opportunity in central Africa.</p>
<h2>Security and Human Rights Concerns</h2>
<p>Israel has announced that Palestinian groups Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have returned the body of Suthisak Rintalak, a Thai agricultural worker who had been held hostage in Gaza. The recovery comes amid ongoing tensions in the region.</p>
<p>In South Korea, the government is developing a smartphone app to show users the real-time location of known stalkers. This initiative responds to increasing concerns about stalking and violence against women in the country, aiming to improve public safety through technology.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Singapore, the court has upheld a guilty verdict against opposition leader Pritam Singh. Singh had appealed a conviction related to lying to a parliamentary committee in 2021. This decision affects the political landscape and public trust in governance.</p>
<p>In the United States, Somali-American communities have expressed deep concerns following intensified criticism and controversial remarks from the US president. Community members say these comments have heightened fear and anxiety within their population, underscoring ongoing challenges related to rhetoric and social cohesion.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business Developments</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is beginning to deactivate accounts belonging to children under 16 in Australia ahead of an official ban. This move reflects growing scrutiny of social media's impact on young users and regulatory pressure to protect minors online.</p>
<p>In the business world, Adidas has won an appeal in a legal dispute involving its past collaboration with rapper Kanye West. Investors had accused Adidas of wrongdoing linked to the partnership, but the court sided with the company, providing some resolution to ongoing corporate controversies.</p>
<h2>New Information Released</h2>
<p>Unseen images of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island have been released as part of a pending deadline for broader document disclosures by the US government. This release adds to public knowledge about Epstein’s activities and the investigations surrounding his case.</p>
