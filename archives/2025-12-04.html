    <h2>International Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>
<p>US and Ukrainian negotiators are set to meet in Miami this Thursday following talks in Moscow, according to the White House. US special envoy Steve Witkoff will engage with senior Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov. These discussions are likely part of ongoing efforts to address conflict-related issues in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun a two-day visit to India. The visit is viewed as significant due to its implications for oil, defense, and broader geopolitical relations between the two nations.</p>
<p>In Africa, the US president will host a signing ceremony for a peace agreement between leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The deal aims to foster stability and potentially encourage increased American investment in the resource-rich region.</p>
<h2>Security and Justice Developments</h2>
<p>Israel has identified remains found in northern Gaza as those of a Thai national taken hostage, with forensic tests to be conducted in Tel Aviv. The remains were discovered by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, highlighting ongoing tensions and humanitarian concerns.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the court upheld the guilty verdict against opposition leader Pritam Singh, who was found guilty of lying to a parliamentary committee in 2021. His appeal to overturn this verdict was rejected.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Issues</h2>
<p>Meta has begun taking steps to close Instagram and Facebook accounts of Australian users under 16, ahead of an official ban set to take effect in a week. This move reflects increasing regulatory scrutiny around social media use among children.</p>
<p>In South Korea, developers are working on an app designed to show the real-time location of potential stalkers, responding to growing concerns over stalking and violence against women in the country. The initiative has sparked debate over privacy and the effectiveness of technological interventions.</p>
<h2>Social and Community Concerns in the US</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, members of the Somali community express significant fear and apprehension after increased criticism from the US president targeting their community. This has heightened concerns about an immigration crackdown and its impact on their lives and sense of safety.</p>
<h2>Legal and Corporate Updates</h2>
<p>A court has ruled in favor of Adidas in an appeal concerning its collaboration with rapper Kanye West. Investors had accused the company of misleading them as the partnership showed signs of strain, but the ruling supports Adidas’s position in the dispute.</p>
<h2>Unreleased Documents and Investigations</h2>
<p>Previously unseen images of Jeffrey Epstein’s island have been released, coming ahead of a deadline for broader disclosure of documents held by the US government related to the case. This release is part of ongoing public interest in Epstein’s connections and activities.</p>
