    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict Developments</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia will take control of the Donbas region either by force or if Ukrainian troops withdraw. His comments come ahead of a planned new round of negotiations between US and Ukrainian officials. The situation remains tense as international efforts continue to seek diplomatic solutions to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Putin's Visit to India</h2>
<p>Putin has begun a two-day visit to India, a trip marked by discussions focused on oil, defense, and broader geopolitical interests. The visit is seen as significant in strengthening ties between Russia and India amid shifting global alliances. Energy cooperation and defense deals are expected to be among key topics, with strategic implications for regional and international relations.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Conflict Impacts</h2>
<p>There were reports of Yasser Abu Shabab, a leader of an anti-Hamas militia, being killed in Gaza. His group clarified that he was shot during a family dispute, not by Hamas forces. Meanwhile, the body of Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer and the last hostage reportedly held by Hamas in Gaza, has not yet been returned. His parents expressed solidarity with all Israeli people during this difficult time.</p>
<p>Moreover, Israel conducted airstrikes on sites linked to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon shortly after the first direct civilian talks between Israel and Lebanon in decades. This action underscores ongoing volatility in the region despite tentative diplomatic engagement.</p>
<h2>International Peace Efforts in Africa</h2>
<p>The US hosted a signing ceremony for a peace deal between leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The agreement aims to reduce conflict in the resource-rich region and is expected to open the door for increased American investment. This development represents a hopeful step toward long-term stability in Central Africa.</p>
<h2>Historical Preservation in Gaza</h2>
<p>Efforts have started to recover and clear rubble from archaeological heritage sites damaged by war in Gaza. While initial clean-up work is underway, restoring these sites faces challenges due to restrictions imposed by Israeli authorities on building materials needed for full restoration. The work is described as "first aid" for the manuscripts and artifacts, highlighting the fragile state of cultural preservation amid ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>US Security and Legal Updates</h2>
<p>A suspect has been arrested in connection with pipe bombs planted on the eve of the January 6 Capitol riot, ending a years-long manhunt. The devices were discovered as rioters began storming the Capitol. Additionally, Admiral Frank Bradley briefed US lawmakers about a September incident involving a drug boat where he clarified that no order was given to "kill them all," addressing questions surrounding the military's use of force in the event.</p>
