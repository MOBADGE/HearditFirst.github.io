    <h2>International Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin of Russia has begun a two-day visit to India. The visit focuses on topics such as oil, defense, and geopolitics. This visit highlights the strategic relationship between Russia and India, especially in the context of global energy markets and regional security dynamics.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Israeli authorities have identified the remains of a hostage as belonging to a Thai national. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad reported these findings in northern Gaza. The remains are being taken to Tel Aviv for forensic examination. This development comes amid ongoing tensions in the region and the effort to account for missing or captured persons.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Issues</h2>
<p>The Somali community in Minnesota is experiencing significant concern ahead of potential immigration crackdowns. The community members have expressed heightened fear following intensified criticism from the US president. This situation underscores ongoing challenges around immigration policy and community relations within the United States.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former US president Donald Trump is set to host a signing ceremony for a peace deal between leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The agreement is intended to promote peace and create conditions favorable for increased American investment in this resource-rich region, signaling the US government's interest in stabilizing and economically engaging with Central Africa.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Media</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has begun removing Australian children under the age of 16 from its platforms ahead of an official ban scheduled to take effect soon.

<h2>Legal and Social Issues Abroad</h2>
<p>In Singapore, a court has upheld the guilty verdict against opposition leader Pritam Singh, who was convicted in 2021 of lying to a parliamentary committee. Singh's appeal was rejected, reaffirming the earlier ruling.</p>

<h2>Business and Cultural News</h2>
