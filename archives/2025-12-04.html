    <h2>International Diplomacy and Geopolitics</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun a two-day visit to India, a key event given the geopolitical and economic context. The visit is significant as it involves discussions on oil, defense, and strategic partnerships, reflecting the ongoing importance of Russia-India relations in global affairs. This meeting may influence energy markets and defense collaborations, underlining India’s role as a major international player balancing relations between Russia and Western countries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, diplomatic efforts continue around the Ukraine conflict. US special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to meet senior Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Miami for talks. This follows earlier discussions in Moscow and suggests ongoing attempts to negotiate resolutions or de-escalate tensions. These negotiations could shape the future of the conflict and international involvement.</p>
<h2>Regional Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>In Central Africa, a peace deal is set to be signed between leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The signing will be hosted by the US president, who hopes the agreement will open the door to greater American investments in the resource-rich region. This initiative highlights efforts to resolve long-standing conflicts and promote economic development through improved political stability.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Social Issues</h2>
<p>South Korea is developing a new app designed to show the real-time location of people accused of stalking. The initiative comes amid public concerns over widespread stalking and violence against women. This technological measure aims to enhance personal safety and could influence legal and social approaches to addressing harassment.</p>
<p>In other human rights news, Israel announced that Palestinian groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have returned the body of a Thai hostage, Suthisak Rintalak, who had been held in Gaza. This development may affect ongoing humanitarian dialogues related to hostages and broader Israeli-Palestinian relations.</p>
<h2>Technology and Social Media</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has started disabling accounts of Australian children under the age of 16. The move comes a week ahead of an official ban, reflecting increasing regulatory pressures and concerns about child safety on social media platforms. This step marks a significant shift in how tech companies manage underage users’ presence online.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Updates</h2>
<p>In Singapore, the court upheld a guilty verdict against opposition leader Pritam Singh for lying to a parliamentary committee in 2021. The verdict, which Singh had appealed, may impact Singapore’s political landscape and the role of opposition voices in parliament.</p>
<p>In the United States, the court ruled in favor of Adidas in its legal appeal concerning its collaboration with Kanye West. Investors had accused Adidas of misleading them as their partnership showed signs of trouble. This legal decision could influence future collaborations between brands and high-profile artists.</p>
<h2>Community and Social Concerns</h2>
<p>Somali-American communities in the US voiced fears following heightened criticism from the US president, who referred to them in negative terms. Members of this community described experiencing increased anxiety and concern for their safety and social standing. These remarks have sparked broader discussions on political rhetoric and its effects on minority groups.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories outline significant international diplomacy, peace efforts, social initiatives, and legal matters shaping global and local events today. The developments may have lasting impacts on geopolitical relations, human rights, political dynamics, and social technologies.</p>
