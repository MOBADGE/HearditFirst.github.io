    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 04, 2025</div>
    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Russian leader Vladimir Putin has issued a stark message about the situation in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, saying Russia will either take control of the area by force or Ukraine's troops will withdraw. His comments came as U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators prepared for a new round of talks. This statement underscores the ongoing tension and high stakes surrounding the conflict, suggesting Russia may intensify military efforts if diplomatic efforts fail.</p>
<h2>Putin’s Visit to India: Oil, Defence, and Geopolitics</h2>
<p>Putin has begun a two-day visit to India, a trip that highlights the strategic importance of oil, defense, and broader geopolitical ties between the two countries. The visit comes amidst global shifts in energy markets and alliances, with both nations looking to deepen cooperation. This could influence regional security dynamics and energy supply routes in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Cultural Impact: Eurovision Boycott and Heritage Recovery</h2>
<p>Several countries, including Ireland, have announced they will boycott the Eurovision Song Contest because Israel was allowed to compete despite calls for its exclusion related to the conflict in Gaza. This reflects cultural and political tensions affecting international events.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza have begun efforts to clear rubble and recover important archaeological sites damaged by war. However, restoration work faces challenges due to Israeli restrictions on building materials, complicating efforts to preserve cultural heritage in a conflict zone.</p>
<h2>Security and Legal Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>Authorities have arrested a suspect in connection with a pipe bomb incident that occurred on the eve of the January 6 Capitol riots. The bombs were discovered as rioters stormed the Capitol, and the arrest ends a years-long manhunt. This represents a significant development in ongoing investigations related to that day’s events and national security.</p>
<h2>Technological Measures Against Stalking in South Korea</h2>
<p>South Korea is developing an app designed to show the real-time location of stalking perpetrators. The app is a response to widespread concerns about stalking and violence against women in the country. This move reflects growing efforts to use technology to protect vulnerable populations and address social issues.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Political Activism in Africa</h2>
<p>Meta, the company behind social media platforms such as Instagram, has confirmed the removal of Tanzanian activist Mange Kimambi’s accounts. The activist had been mobilizing election protests, but the removal was due to violations of Meta’s policies. This development raises questions about social media’s role in political expression and regulation in Africa.</p>
<h2>Additional International News</h2>
<p>Israel announced that Palestinian groups returned the body of a Thai agricultural worker who had been held hostage in Gaza. This comes amid ongoing hostilities in the region and reflects complex negotiations related to captives.</p>
<p>In the United States, new images of Jeffrey Epstein’s island have been released ahead of an anticipated government document release. This continues public interest in the broader Epstein case.</p>
<p>Separately, Somali-American communities have expressed concern and fear following critical remarks made by the U.S. president about their community, highlighting ongoing sensitivities around political rhetoric and minority groups in the U.S.</p>
