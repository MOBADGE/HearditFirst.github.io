    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 23, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Four years into the war in Ukraine, Russia is now grappling with significant economic consequences stemming from the conflict. These effects are impacting everyday life, as people find various ways to cope with shortages and disruptions caused by the ongoing hostilities.</p>
<p>In Mexico, the recent killing of the Jalisco drug cartel's most-wanted leader has sparked widespread violence. Retaliatory attacks linked to the cartel henchmen have spread across at least a dozen states. This development follows a security operation involving Mexican forces and U.S. intelligence. The death of this key figure, El Mencho, is a major event considering the power and influence he held within the cartel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, an armed man carrying a shotgun and a fuel can was killed after breaching the secure perimeter of a former U.S. president's residence. The suspect was shot by Secret Service agents, and no one else was reported harmed. At the time, the former occupant was not present at the Rhode Island location.</p>
<h2>Political Leadership</h2>
<p>North Korea's ruling party congress reaffirmed Kim Jong Un in his leadership role. This decision was expected given the Kim family's longstanding control over the country since the 1940s. The re-appointment shows the continuation of established political structures in North Korea.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Nepalese authorities confirmed the deaths of 19 people in a bus crash, including a 24-year-old British man. The incident highlights ongoing challenges in transportation safety in the region.</p>
<p>In Australia, prosecutors are considering reopening a cold case involving the disappearance of Cheryl Grimmer, a British girl. Her family has petitioned police to review new evidence they have recently found, raising hopes for renewed investigation into the decades-old case.</p>
<h2>Weather and Lifestyle</h2>
<p>A severe winter storm has hit parts of the northeastern United States, leading to heavy snowfall, power outages, and travel disruptions. Authorities have issued weather warnings and travel bans to ensure public safety as the storm continues.</p>
<p>On a different note, jobs are open for a wide range of roles in Antarctica, including chefs, plumbers, and even hairdressers. These opportunities reflect the unique demands of life and work in the extreme conditions of the icy continent.</p>
<h2>Economic and Social Trends</h2>
<p>In India, budget fast fashion brands are becoming increasingly popular in small towns. More shoppers are opting for affordable branded items over unlabelled goods traditionally sold in bazaars. This shift indicates changing consumer preferences and growing access to diverse retail options outside major cities.</p>
