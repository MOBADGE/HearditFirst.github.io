    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 23, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Conflicts and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the country is facing significant economic challenges. The ongoing war has taken a toll on Russia’s economy, affecting both government finances and the daily lives of ordinary people. While the long-term impact remains to be seen, the conflict continues to shape regional stability and global relations.</p>
<p>In North Korea, Kim Jong Un has been re-appointed as the leader of the ruling party. This move was widely expected, reflecting the longstanding control of the Kim family over the country's leadership since the 1940s. The reaffirmation underscores the regime's continued political continuity amid international pressures.</p>
<h2>Crime and Violence</h2>
<p>Violence has erupted in Mexico following the death of the most-wanted chief of the Jalisco drug cartel. This killing has led to retaliatory attacks across at least a dozen states, highlighting the ongoing challenges the country faces in curbing organized crime and cartel-related violence.</p>
<p>In South Africa, Bellarmine Mugabe, the son of Robert Mugabe, and another individual have been charged with attempted murder related to a shooting incident involving a 23-year-old victim. No comments have been made by the accused since the charges were filed.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings and Investigations</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court is currently hearing charges against former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. He faces accusations of crimes against humanity linked to his administration’s aggressive war on drugs, during which thousands of people were reportedly killed. The outcome of these hearings could have significant implications for international justice and human rights accountability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Australia, prosecutors are considering reopening the cold case of Cheryl Grimmer, a British girl who disappeared decades ago. Her family has presented new evidence that they hope will prompt renewed police investigations.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Security Incidents</h2>
<p>In Nepal, a tragic bus crash has claimed the lives of 19 people, including a 24-year-old British national. This incident raises concerns about road safety and transportation infrastructure in the region.</p>
<p>In the United States, an armed man was killed after breaching the secure perimeter of a residence associated with Donald Trump. The suspect was reportedly carrying a shotgun and fuel canisters. At the time of the incident, Trump was in Washington DC. The investigation into the circumstances surrounding the security breach is ongoing.</p>
<h2>Political Changes and Royal Affairs</h2>
<p>Rob Jetten has been sworn in as the prime minister of the Netherlands, becoming the country’s youngest-ever premier at age 38. He took office after narrowly winning the general election last October, marking a generational shift in Dutch politics.</p>
<p>In royal news, Australia has expressed support for removing Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the British royal line of succession, despite him still being eighth in line even after losing his royal titles. This development reflects ongoing debates about the role and future of the monarchy in Commonwealth realms.</p>
