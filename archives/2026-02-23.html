    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 23, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Conflict and Its Impact</h2>
<p>Four years into Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, the country is experiencing significant economic consequences. The ongoing conflict has strained resources and affected everyday life for many Russians, who are adapting to economic hardships. This situation highlights the long-term effects of prolonged warfare on a nation's economy and society.</p>
<p>In related news, the death of a top drug lord from the Jalisco cartel in Mexico has set off waves of violence across at least a dozen states. This retaliation underscores the volatility in regions controlled by powerful criminal organizations and the ongoing challenges in combating cartel-related violence.</p>
<h2>Political Leadership Changes</h2>
<p>The Netherlands has a new prime minister. Rob Jetten, at 38 years old, is now the youngest person ever to hold the position after winning a narrow election victory in October. His leadership marks a generational shift in Dutch politics, and attention will focus on how he navigates the responsibilities of his new role.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in North Korea, Kim Jong Un has been re-appointed as leader of the ruling party during a party congress. This continuation of leadership aligns with the long-standing control his family has maintained since the 1940s, indicating stability within the country’s political structure.</p>
<h2>Legal and Security Developments</h2>
<p>In South Africa, Bellarmine Mugabe, the son of Robert Mugabe, has been charged with attempted murder related to a shooting incident involving a 23-year-old. Neither Mugabe nor another man involved have commented on the charges. This case brings attention to legal accountability and high-profile individuals facing serious accusations.</p>
<p>In the United States, an armed man carrying a shotgun and fuel can was killed after entering a secure area near Donald Trump’s residence. Trump was in Washington, DC, during the incident. Authorities have not indicated any further developments, but the event raises concerns about security measures at high-profile locations.</p>
<h2>Justice and Ongoing Investigations</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is hearing charges against former Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte. He faces accusations of crimes against humanity linked to a deadly anti-drug campaign that resulted in thousands of deaths. The proceedings may have significant implications for international law and human rights accountability.</p>
<p>In Australia, prosecutors are considering reopening the cold case of Cheryl Grimmer, a British girl who disappeared many years ago. Grimmer’s family has presented new evidence in hopes that authorities will renew efforts to find answers. This reflects ongoing interest in resolving historical cases through advances in investigation or re-examination of existing information.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Tragedies</h2>
<p>A bus crash in Nepal has claimed 19 lives, including that of a 24-year-old British man. Nepalese police confirmed the fatality of the young Briton among others. The incident is a reminder of road safety challenges in the region and the potential dangers faced by travelers.</p>
<h2>Monarchy and Succession</h2>
<p>In Australia, there is support for removing Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the royal line of succession. Despite this, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne, even though he has been stripped of various titles. This situation illustrates the complexities and ongoing discussions related to royal succession and titles.</p>
