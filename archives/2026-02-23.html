    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>The war in Ukraine has now entered its fifth year, with Russia facing mounting economic challenges as a result. Reporter Steve Rosenberg highlights how the conflict is impacting Russia's economy and the daily lives of its people. Meanwhile, efforts to negotiate peace continue, with Ukrainian negotiator Sergiy Kyslytsya describing what it is like to engage directly with Russian counterparts in talks. The progress and outcome of these negotiations remain uncertain, but the ongoing dialogue shows continued attempts to end the war.</p>
<h2>Violence in Mexico</h2>
<p>Following the killing of the most-wanted chief of the Jalisco drug cartel, Mexico is experiencing a wave of violent retaliations. At least a dozen states have reported incidents linked to cartel enforcers responding to the leader’s death. This surge in violence underscores the instability in regions plagued by organized crime and raises concerns about the safety of civilians in affected areas.</p>
