    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 23, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Four years into the wide-scale war in Ukraine, Russia is experiencing significant economic consequences. The conflict has affected not only Russia's economy but also how its people are managing daily life. These impacts highlight the ongoing challenges the country faces as the war continues.</p>
<p>In Mexico, violence has surged after the death of El Mencho, the most-wanted leader of the Jalisco drug cartel. His death followed a clash with security forces supported by US intelligence. Following this event, retaliatory attacks have erupted in at least a dozen Mexican states, raising concerns about further instability in the region.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>Rob Jetten has become the youngest prime minister in the Netherlands at 38 years old. He was sworn in after a narrow victory in the country's October election. His leadership marks a significant moment for Dutch politics as the country embarks on a new administration.</p>
<p>In North Korea, Kim Jong Un has been re-appointed as the leader of the ruling party by a congress that largely acts in support of his leadership. This continuation reflects the longstanding grip the Kim family has maintained over the country's political structure since the 1940s.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in South Africa, Bellarmine Mugabe, son of former Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe, has been charged with attempted murder in connection with a shooting incident involving a 23-year-old. He and another suspect have not made public comments about the charges.</p>
<h2>Legal and Justice News</h2>
<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is hearing charges against former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. He faces accusations of crimes against humanity related to a prolonged and violent war on drugs that resulted in thousands of deaths. The case is significant as it addresses accountability for alleged human rights abuses under Duterte's administration.</p>
<p>In Australia, prosecutors are considering reopening the cold case of Cheryl Grimmer, a British girl who disappeared decades ago. Her family has petitioned authorities, presenting what they believe to be new evidence that could shed light on her disappearance.</p>
<h2>Domestic Incidents</h2>
<p>In the United States, an armed man carrying a shotgun and fuel can was killed after entering the secure perimeter of the former residence of Donald Trump. Trump was not at the location at the time of the incident but was in Washington DC. The situation raised immediate security concerns around the site.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Tragedies</h2>
<p>A bus crash in Nepal resulted in the death of 19 people, including a 24-year-old British national. The incident highlights ongoing issues with road safety in the region, affecting both locals and tourists. Authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the crash.</p>
