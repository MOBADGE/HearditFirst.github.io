    <h2>Russia's War in Ukraine and Its Effects</h2>
<p>Four years after Russia launched a full-scale war in Ukraine, the country is experiencing significant economic consequences. Steve Rosenberg reports that the conflict has strained Russia's economy and affected daily life for many citizens. Despite initial expectations that the war would be short, the prolonged fighting has led to a more sustained and serious impact. People across Russia are adapting to challenges stemming from sanctions, resource shortages, and broader instability. Meanwhile, efforts to negotiate peace continue as the conflict enters its fifth year.</p>
<h2>Negotiations Between Ukraine and Russia</h2>
<p>Serhii Kyslytsia, a Ukrainian negotiator, shares his perspective on the difficult talks aimed at ending the war. Sitting across the table from Russian representatives remains emotionally and politically complex. These negotiations have occurred intermittently during the conflict, reflecting ongoing attempts to find a diplomatic solution. The process is slow and fraught with tension, underscoring the challenges of resolving a long and destructive war.</p>
<h2>Violence Unfolds in Mexico After Cartel Leader's Death</h2>
<p>In Mexico, violence has surged following the killing of the leader of the Jalisco cartel, one of the country's most-wanted drug lords. The cartel's henchmen have unleashed retaliatory attacks in at least a dozen states, escalating insecurity across the region. This development highlights the persistent challenges Mexico faces with organized crime and drug trafficking, which continue to fuel violence and instability.</p>
<h2>Security Incident at Trump's Residence</h2>
<p>An armed man was killed after entering the secure perimeter surrounding Donald Trump's residence. The suspect was reportedly carrying a shotgun and a fuel can. Secret Service officers responded to the threat and neutralized the individual. At the time, Trump was in Washington, DC. The incident raises questions about security protocols around high-profile figures and the potential risks they face.</p>
<h2>New Prime Minister in the Netherlands</h2>
<p>Rob Jetten, aged 38, has become the youngest person ever sworn in as prime minister of the Netherlands. He assumed office following a narrow victory in the October elections. This marks a generational change in Dutch leadership and will likely influence the country’s political direction in the coming years. Jetten’s premiership begins amid a complex international landscape, including ongoing conflicts in Europe such as the war in Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Additional Global News Briefs</h2>
