    <h2>Mexico Deploys Troops Amid Surge in Violence</h2>
<p>Following the death of a powerful drug cartel boss after his capture by special forces, Mexico is facing a significant increase in violence. In response, thousands of soldiers have been sent to troubled areas to restore order. This military intervention highlights the ongoing challenges Mexico faces in controlling drug-related violence and maintaining security. The government’s actions aim to prevent further instability, but the situation remains tense.</p>
<h2>U.S. Embassy in Beirut Partially Evacuated</h2>
<p>The U.S. State Department has ordered non-essential personnel to leave the embassy in Beirut after conducting a security review amid rising tensions with Iran. This partial evacuation reflects concerns about security conditions in Lebanon and the surrounding region. The move underscores ongoing diplomatic and safety challenges the U.S. faces in the Middle East, with potential impacts on diplomatic operations and regional relations.</p>
<h2>War in Ukraine Marks Four Years with Widespread Impact</h2>
<p>The conflict in Ukraine, now entering its fifth year, continues to shape the region and beyond. Reports detail the economic effects felt in Russia as a result of the war, highlighting difficulties faced by ordinary people. Meanwhile, Ukrainian negotiators, including Sergiy Kyslytsya, are working towards peace talks, meeting with Russian counterparts despite deep divisions. The long duration of the conflict suggests a protracted struggle with uncertain prospects for resolution.</p>
<h2>New Prime Minister of the Netherlands</h2>
<p>Rob Jetten has become the youngest ever prime minister of the Netherlands at 38 years old. He officially took office after securing a narrow victory in the country’s October election.

<h2>Security Incident Near Trump’s Residence</h2>
