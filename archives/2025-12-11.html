    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>Venezuela and US Tensions Rise</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, María Corina Machado, a Nobel laureate, has emerged publicly in Oslo to collect her award after spending months in hiding. Her secret journey out of the country highlights ongoing political challenges within Venezuela. Meanwhile, the United States has seized an oil tanker near Venezuela, an action sharply condemned by Caracas as an "act of piracy." This move marks a significant escalation in Washington’s campaign to pressure the government led by Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict Concerns</h2>
<p>Australia is facing serious concerns as the number of Indigenous deaths in custody has reached its highest level since 1980. From July last year to June this year, 33 of the 113 deaths in custody involved Indigenous people, spotlighting urgent issues around justice and systemic inequality.</p>
<p>In Myanmar, a military air strike hit a hospital, resulting in more than 30 deaths. The military junta has intensified air bombardments targeting areas controlled by ethnic armed groups, aiming to regain territory. This attack adds to ongoing conflict and humanitarian crises in the country.</p>
<h2>Global Labor and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Portugal experienced severe disruption due to its first general strike in 12 years. The strike was a response to labour reforms introduced by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro’s government. The large turnout and widespread impact suggest significant opposition to the reforms, potentially challenging the government's agenda.</p>
<p>In Japan, a prominent shogi (Japanese chess) player criticized the association’s rules for pregnancy, which she says force players to choose between having children and continuing their careers. This debate highlights ongoing issues around workplace policies and gender equity in professional settings.</p>
<h2>Immigration and Trade Policies</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has launched a new special visa program called the "$1 million gold card." These visas will be granted to individuals who can demonstrate they will bring substantial benefits to the United States, indicating an attempt to attract high-value immigrants and investors.</p>
<p>Mexico has approved tariffs of up to 50% on imports from China and other countries. These tariffs will take effect on January 1 and will impact products such as cars, clothing, and appliances. This move reflects Mexico’s efforts to protect domestic industries and modify its trade relationships.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Entertainment Scene</h2>
<p>South Korea is again in the spotlight over its "cancel culture," as three major entertainers have recently been involved in separate scandals. This series of events has revived debates about the public and media’s role in punishing celebrities and the broader social implications of cancel culture.</p>
