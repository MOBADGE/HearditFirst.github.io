    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Tensions and Security</h2>
<p>The US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, escalating its pressure against Nicolás Maduro's government. Caracas condemned the move as an "act of piracy," highlighting worsening tensions between the two countries. Meanwhile, Polish authorities arrested a Russian archaeologist wanted by Ukraine over illegal excavations in Crimea, underscoring ongoing conflicts linked to the region.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In Pakistan, the military sentenced Faiz Hameed, former head of the ISI intelligence agency, to 14 years in jail. Hameed served during the tenure of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is also currently imprisoned. In Asia, brothers Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, nightclub owners connected to a recent deadly fire in Goa, India, were detained in Thailand after fleeing the country.</p>
<h2>Social and Labor Issues</h2>
<p>Portugal experienced its first general strike in 12 years, resulting in severe disruption nationwide. The strike reflects strong public opposition to Prime Minister Luís Montenegro’s proposed labour reforms. In Austria, a ban on headscarves for schoolgirls under 14 was introduced, renewing debate after a similar ban for younger children was previously overturned for targeting Muslims.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict Zones</h2>
<p>More than 30 people died after a Myanmar military air strike hit a hospital. The military junta has intensified its air bombardments in a bid to regain control from ethnic armed groups. In Australia, Indigenous deaths in custody have reached their highest level since 1980, with 33 of 113 deaths between July 2024 and June 2025 involving Indigenous people, raising ongoing concerns about systemic issues in the justice system.</p>
<h2>Technology Recognition</h2>

This recognition highlights the growing impact of AI on society and various industries.</p>
