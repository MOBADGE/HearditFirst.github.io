    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The United States has taken a significant step in its ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuela by seizing an oil tanker accused of smuggling sanctioned oil. This move has drawn sharp condemnation from Caracas, which labeled the action an "act of piracy." The tanker had reportedly concealed its true location for an extended period, operating across regions including Iran, China, and Venezuela, raising concerns about the effectiveness of sanctions enforcement and maritime oversight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine's president has revealed that talks involving the United States include plans for a "special economic zone" in Ukraine's frontline region. However, critical issues remain unresolved, especially concerning control over the territory around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, an area central to peace negotiations amid ongoing tensions.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Bulgaria has experienced a major political shake-up as Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov and his government resigned ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence. This resignation is particularly notable as it occurred just 20 days before Bulgaria is scheduled to adopt the euro, a key step in its economic integration with the European Union.</p>
<p>In Austria, the government has introduced a ban on headscarves for girls under the age of 14 in schools. This follows a previous attempt to ban headscarves for girls under ten, which was struck down by the Constitutional Court because it was seen as specifically targeting Muslim students. The new regulation reflects ongoing debates in Europe about secularism and religious expression in public education.</p>
<h2>Social and Labour Issues</h2>
<p>Portugal experienced its first general strike in 12 years, causing severe disruption across the country. The strike was in response to proposed labor reforms by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro’s government. The widespread participation in the strike appears to have caught the government by surprise, indicating substantial public opposition to the reforms.</p>
<h2>Justice and Human Rights</h2>
<p>In the United States, a judge ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from ICE custody, ruling that his detention lacked lawful authority. This decision allows Garcia to return at least temporarily to his home in Maryland. The ruling highlights ongoing legal debates surrounding immigration detention practices.</p>
<p>In Ethiopia, authorities arrested several social media influencers for what police described as "indecent" dressing following an awards ceremony. The individuals face accusations of undermining public morality, underscoring the tension between cultural norms and modern social expressions in the country.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Crisis in Myanmar</h2>
<p>A severe escalation in violence was reported in Myanmar after a military air strike hit a hospital, resulting in more than 30 deaths. This incident is part of a broader intensification of air bombardments by the military junta as it attempts to regain control over territories held by ethnic armed groups. The attack highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis and deteriorating security situation in the country.</p>
<h2>Technology and Culture</h2>
<p>Time Magazine has named the "Architects of AI" as its Person of the Year, recognizing influential figures in artificial intelligence development. Among those featured is Jensen Huang, the head of Nvidia, underscoring the growing importance of AI in shaping global technology and economies. This recognition reflects the rising impact of AI innovations on everyday life and their potential to influence various industries in the coming years.</p>
