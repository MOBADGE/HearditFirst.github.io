    <h2>Latin America: Tensions Rise Over Venezuela</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, María Corina Machado, a Nobel laureate, has appeared in Oslo to receive her prize following months of secrecy and hiding in her home country. Her emergence highlights ongoing struggles for political expression in Venezuela. Meanwhile, the US government seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, an action condemned by Caracas as an "act of piracy." Military footage showed troops boarding the vessel from a helicopter, intensifying the already strained relations between the two countries. These events underline the continuing geopolitical tensions centered on Venezuela’s resources and governance.</p>
<h2>Myanmar: Deadly Air Strike Hits Hospital</h2>
<p>In Myanmar, a military air strike on a hospital resulted in over 30 deaths. This attack is part of increased bombardments by the junta as it attempts to regain control from ethnic armed groups. The escalation of violence raises concerns about the humanitarian impact and the stability of the region as the military intensifies its campaign against opposition forces.</p>
<h2>Australia: Indigenous Deaths in Custody Reach Highest Level in Decades</h2>
<p>New data from Australia reveals a troubling rise in Indigenous deaths in custody, with 33 out of 113 deaths recorded in the past year involving Indigenous people. This is the highest number reported since 1980 and highlights ongoing challenges around prison conditions, justice, and the treatment of Indigenous populations. The statistics may put renewed attention on calls for reform within the criminal justice system.</p>
<h2>Europe: Portugal Faces Major Strike Over Labour Reforms</h2>
<p>Portugal is preparing for significant disruption as workers launch the country's first general strike in 12 years. The strike is a response to government-led labour reforms, which have sparked widespread discontent. Prime Minister Luís Montenegro reportedly did not anticipate the strong public opposition, signaling potential challenges for the government in implementing these policies. The strike reflects broader concerns over workers’ rights and economic conditions in Europe.</p>
<h2>Asia: Social Issues and Trade Measures</h2>
<p>In South Korea, a string of scandals involving major entertainers is reigniting a national conversation about the country’s "cancel culture," where public figures face severe backlash for personal controversies. This wave of negative news about celebrities points to shifting social dynamics and cultural debates.</p>
<p>In Japan, a prominent professional shogi (Japanese chess) player has publicly criticized the national association for pregnancy-related policies, stating that the current rules force female players to choose between having children and pursuing their careers. This highlights gender-based challenges within traditional professional environments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico has approved new tariffs of up to 50% on imports from China and other countries. These levies, set to take effect in early January, will target goods such as cars, clothing, and appliances. The move signals a shift in Mexico’s trade policies, potentially affecting international supply chains and economic relations.</p>
