    <h2>International Relations and Sanctions</h2>
<p>The United States has sanctioned six more ships following the seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. The White House plans to transfer the tanker to a U.S. port and take control of the oil onboard. Venezuela’s government has condemned the action, calling it "international piracy." This move signals ongoing tensions between the two countries and could further impact relations and oil supplies from the region.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>In Bulgaria, Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov and his government resigned amid mass protests. This dramatic step came just before a parliamentary no-confidence vote and shortly before Bulgaria is due to join the eurozone, adding uncertainty to the country's political and economic future. Meanwhile, in Portugal, the first general strike in 12 years caused severe disruptions. Prime Minister Luís Montenegro faces strong opposition over proposed labor reforms, highlighting social unrest related to government policies.</p>
<h2>Education and Social Issues</h2>
<p>South Korea’s chief examiner for the nation’s high-stakes English test resigned after controversy over the difficulty of the questions. Critics argued the test was unnecessarily complex, while others maintained that was intentional. In Austria, authorities have banned headscarves in schools for children under 14. This follows a previous ban on girls under 10 that was struck down by the Constitutional Court for unfairly targeting Muslims, indicating ongoing debates about religious expression and secularism in education.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Legal Cases</h2>
<p>A Salvadoran national, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was released from immigration detention following a court ruling that the government lacked legal grounds to continue holding him. He is married to an American citizen, and this decision may influence future immigration detention cases. In Ethiopia, authorities arrested six social media figures, accusing them of "undermining public morality" related to their attire at an awards ceremony. These actions reflect concerns over personal freedoms and social norms in different parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>More than 30 people died after a Myanmar military air strike hit a hospital. This attack is part of an intensified campaign by the military junta to regain territory from ethnic armed groups. The situation remains volatile with humanitarian and security concerns growing. Separately, Ukraine’s president noted that key issues in a proposed peace plan remain unresolved, including territorial control and the status of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The U.S. has proposed creating a "special economic zone" in Ukraine’s frontline region, aiming to support stabilization efforts in the conflict-affected area.</p>
<h2>Technology and Innovation</h2>
<p>Time Magazine has named the "Architects of AI" as its Person of the Year, recognizing influential figures in artificial intelligence development. Among those featured is Jensen Huang, the head of Nvidia, underscoring the growing impact of AI technologies on society, business, and global innovation.</p>
