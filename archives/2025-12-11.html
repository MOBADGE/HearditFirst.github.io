    <h2>Venezuela and US Tensions Rise</h2>
<p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan Nobel laureate who had been in hiding since January, made a secret trip to Oslo to collect her prize. Her appearance highlights ongoing unrest and political pressure in Venezuela. Meanwhile, the United States seized an oil tanker near Venezuela’s coast, an operation that Caracas has strongly condemned as "international piracy." Venezuela vowed never to become an "oil colony," signaling increased tensions between the two countries. These developments may foreshadow further geopolitical conflict and challenges in the region's oil politics.</p>
<h2>Indigenous Deaths in Australian Custody Raise Concern</h2>
<p>New data from Australia reveals a troubling rise in Indigenous deaths while in custody. Between July last year and June this year, 33 out of 113 deaths involved Indigenous people, marking the highest rate since 1980. This alarming trend has revived calls for deeper systemic reforms to address inequalities and improve oversight of the justice system, highlighting ongoing challenges for Indigenous communities in Australia.</p>
<h2>Immigration Policy Update in the United States</h2>
<p>The US introduced a new "gold card" immigration visa program targeting individuals who can prove they bring a "substantial benefit" to the country. This initiative, announced by Donald Trump, involves visas that cost up to $1 million, marking a shift towards attracting wealthy and talented migrants. The move may generate debate over immigration access and economic strategy going forward.</p>
<h2>Labour Unrest in Portugal</h2>
<p>Portugal is preparing for its first nationwide general strike in 12 years amid strong opposition to the government’s proposed labour reforms. Prime Minister Luís Montenegro seems caught off guard by the scale of public resistance. The strike signals deep tensions over employment policies and workers’ rights and could impact Portugal’s political atmosphere and economic stability in the near term.</p>
<h2>Mexico Imposes New Tariffs on Imports</h2>
<p>Mexico has approved tariffs of up to 50% on goods imported from China and other countries, effective from January 1. These levies will affect various products including cars, clothing, and appliances. The tariffs aim to protect domestic industries but could lead to trade friction and higher prices for consumers, affecting Mexico’s trade relations globally.</p>
<h2>Rising Concerns Over Youth Violence in France</h2>
<p>The French government has reported a sharp increase in teenagers involved in the drug trade in Marseille, with the number quadrupling over the past eight years. This escalation in youth engagement with drug gangs is causing public alarm and raising questions about social policy and law enforcement strategies to combat gang violence and protect vulnerable communities in urban France.</p>
