    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Security and Sanctions</h2>
<p>The United States has sanctioned six additional ships following the seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. The White House intends to bring the tanker to a US port and confiscate the oil onboard. Venezuela’s government has condemned the action, calling it "international piracy." This move escalates tensions between the two countries and reflects the ongoing conflict over control of energy resources.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Bulgaria and Ukraine</h2>
<p>In Bulgaria, Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov and his government resigned amid widespread protests and just 20 days before the country is set to adopt the euro. The resignation came ahead of an anticipated parliamentary vote of no confidence, highlighting political instability ahead of a major economic transition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine's president spoke about ongoing efforts for peace in the conflict with Russia. He mentioned that the United States supports creating a "special economic zone" in a frontline region of Ukraine. Key unresolved issues remain, including control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power facility, which is critical for stability in the region.</p>
<h2>Social and Legal Changes in Europe</h2>
<p>Austria has implemented a ban on headscarves in schools for children under the age of 14. This policy follows a previous court ruling that overturned a similar ban for girls under 10, which was deemed discriminatory against Muslims. The new ban may raise further debates about religious expression and integration in European schools.</p>
<p>In South Korea, the head of the country's high-stakes English exam resigned following a public backlash. Critics described the English test questions as unnecessarily difficult, while some defended them as appropriately challenging. The resignation highlights pressures in South Korea’s education system concerning fairness and exam standards.</p>
<h2>Protests and Strikes in Europe</h2>
<p>Portugal experienced severe disruption as workers engaged in the country's first general strike in 12 years. The strike reflected strong opposition to recent labor reforms introduced by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro’s government. The prime minister appeared surprised by the depth of public dissatisfaction, suggesting ongoing challenges to managing economic policy and labor relations.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Ethiopia, several social media influencers were arrested after an awards ceremony, accused by police of "undermining public morality" due to their attire. The arrests have sparked discussions about cultural norms and censorship in the country.</p>
<p>In the United States, a Salvadoran national named Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from immigration detention following a court ruling. The judge found that the government lacked the legal authority to continue detaining him. Garcia is married to an American citizen, which factored into the legal decision.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Casualties in Myanmar</h2>
<p>Myanmar's military increased air strikes in an effort to regain territory from ethnic armed groups. A recent air strike hit a hospital, killing more than 30 people. This escalation underscores the continuing violence and humanitarian crisis in the country, raising concerns about civilian safety and the impact of ongoing conflict.</p>
