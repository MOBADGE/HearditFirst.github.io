    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>Latin America: Political Turmoil and Tensions</h2>
<p>Maria Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, made her first public appearance after months in hiding. She spoke to the BBC from Oslo, sharing details about her secretive journey since January. Meanwhile, tensions between the US and Venezuela escalated after the US seized an oil tanker near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela condemned the seizure, labeling it "international piracy" and asserting it will never be an "oil colony." These developments highlight ongoing political unrest and strained international relations involving Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Social Issues: Indigenous Deaths in Australia and Labor Unrest in Portugal</h2>
<p>In Australia, new government figures revealed a troubling rise in deaths in custody among Indigenous people. Between July 2024 and June 2025, 33 of the 113 deaths in custody were Indigenous, marking the highest level since 1980. This data calls attention to longstanding concerns about Indigenous rights and justice in Australia.</p>
<p>Portugal faces significant social disruption as the country prepares for its first general strike in 12 years. The strike is a protest against the government’s proposed labor reforms. Prime Minister Luís Montenegro appears surprised by the strong public opposition, indicating potential challenges for his administration ahead.</p>
<h2>Immigration and Economic Policy: U.S. Visa Program and Mexico’s Tariffs</h2>
<p>In the United States, former US President Donald Trump launched a new immigration visa program targeting wealthy applicants. Called the $1 million "gold card," the visas will be granted to individuals who demonstrate they can provide a “substantial benefit” to the country. This initiative aims to attract investment but raises questions about the future of US immigration policy.</p>
<p>Mexico announced it will impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from China and other countries starting January 1. These duties will apply to goods including cars, clothing, and appliances. This move is expected to impact trade dynamics and could lead to higher costs for consumers.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business: Concerns Over AI and Corporate Earnings</h2>
<p>Shares in Oracle, a major cloud computing and artificial intelligence company, fell sharply after the company reported revenue below expectations. This revenue miss has intensified concerns about Oracle’s financial health and raised broader questions about the sustainability of growth in the AI sector.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society: Gender Bias in Japan and Cancel Culture in South Korea</h2>
<p>A leading Japanese shogi (Japanese chess) player has publicly criticized the national association’s rules, claiming they force female players to choose between motherhood and their careers. This complaint has spotlighted ongoing gender bias in professional sports and the challenges faced by working mothers.</p>
<p>In South Korea, recent scandals involving three prominent entertainers have reignited debate about the country's "cancel culture." These incidents have sparked discussion over the social consequences of public shaming and the pressures faced by celebrities in the digital age.</p>
<h2>Crime and Public Safety: Youth Involvement in French Drug Gangs</h2>
<p>France is grappling with a surge in youth involvement in drug-related violence, especially in Marseille. The government reports that the number of teenagers participating in the drug trade has quadrupled over the past eight years. This alarming trend has caused public concern about safety and the need for measures to address youth crime and social instability.</p>
