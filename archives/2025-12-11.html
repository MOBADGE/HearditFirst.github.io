    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The United States has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, escalating pressure on the government of Nicolás Maduro. Caracas condemned the move as an "act of piracy." The tanker was accused of smuggling sanctioned oil and reportedly took steps to hide its true location, including movements from Iran to China before reaching Venezuela. The seizure marks a sharp intensification in Washington’s campaign against Maduro’s administration.</p>
<p>In Bulgaria, Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov and his government resigned amid mass protests. This came just ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence and only 20 days before Bulgaria is set to adopt the euro currency. The resignation adds uncertainty to the political landscape as the country prepares for this significant economic milestone.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s president stated that a peace plan concerning the ongoing conflict remains unsettled, particularly regarding the control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and surrounding frontline territory. The US has proposed establishing a "special economic zone" in this region as part of efforts to promote peace. These discussions are critical to resolving ongoing tensions and ensuring security around the nuclear facility.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Policies</h2>
<p>Austria has banned headscarves in schools for children under 14 years old. This follows a previous ban for girls under 10 that was struck down by the Constitutional Court for targeting Muslims specifically. The current policy continues to raise questions about religious freedom and integration in schools.</p>
<p>In Ethiopia, several social media stars have been arrested after an awards ceremony, accused by police of "undermining public morality" for dressing "indecently." The arrests highlight ongoing tensions around social norms and government control of public behavior.</p>
<h2>Labor Unrest and Economic Issues</h2>
<p>Portugal experienced its first general strike in 12 years, causing severe disruption across the country. The strike is in response to proposed labor reforms by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro’s government. The size and strength of the protest seemed to take the prime minister by surprise and reflects growing dissatisfaction among Portuguese workers with changes to employment laws.</p>
<h2>Technology and Culture</h2>
<p>Time Magazine named the "architects of AI" as Person of the Year, highlighting influential figures in artificial intelligence development. Among those featured is Jensen Huang, the boss of Nvidia, a leading company in AI technology. This recognition underscores the significant impact AI continues to have on society and the economy.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Humanitarian Concerns</h2>
<p>In Myanmar, more than 30 people died after a military air strike hit a hospital. The military junta has increased air bombardments in efforts to regain territory from ethnic armed groups. The attack on the hospital marks a severe escalation in violence and raises serious humanitarian concerns amid ongoing conflict.</p>
