    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>Latin America: Venezuela Prize and Tensions</h2>
<p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan Nobel laureate, recently appeared in Oslo to collect her prize after months of remaining hidden in her home country. She spoke to the BBC about her secretive journey out of Venezuela, highlighting the challenges she faced in leaving amid political unrest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions between the US and Venezuela escalated as the US seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast. Video footage captured a military helicopter deploying troops onto the ship. Venezuela's government condemned this action as an "act of piracy," signalling growing conflict over control of resources and regional security.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns: Indigenous Deaths in Australia, Myanmar Hospital Strike</h2>
<p>New official figures reveal a troubling rise in deaths of Indigenous people in custody in Australia. From July last year to June this year, 33 out of 113 deaths were Indigenous, marking the highest rate since 1980. This data underscores ongoing issues with incarceration conditions and calls for reform.</p>
<p>In Myanmar, over 30 people have died after a military air strike hit a hospital. The junta has increased air bombardments as part of efforts to regain territory from ethnic armies, signaling a dangerous escalation in the country’s internal conflict and raising urgent humanitarian concerns.</p>
<h2>International Incidents: Nightclub Case in Thailand; Mexico Tariffs</h2>
<p>Two brothers, Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, who own a nightclub in Goa, India, have been detained in Thailand following a deadly fire at their club last week. The brothers fled to Phuket shortly after the incident, and their arrest now raises questions about accountability and the investigation’s next steps.</p>
<p>Mexico announced it will impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from China and other countries starting January 1. The duties will affect products including cars, clothing, and appliances. This move is expected to impact trade relationships and may escalate tensions amid ongoing global economic competition.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Issues: South Korea Cancel Culture and Japan’s Shogi Bias</h2>
<p>South Korea is witnessing renewed debates about its "cancel culture" following scandals involving three prominent entertainers in recent days. The incidents have sparked discussions on public morality, media influence, and social accountability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a leading Japanese shogi player spoke out about pregnancy discrimination within the professional association. The player criticized current regulations that compel women to choose between continuing their careers and having children, calling attention to gender bias and the need for policy changes in sports.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy Update</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has launched a new immigration program offering "$1 million gold card" visas aimed at individuals who can demonstrate they will provide a “substantial benefit” to the US. Details on eligibility and implementation remain limited, but the initiative signifies ongoing shifts in immigration policy debates.</p>
