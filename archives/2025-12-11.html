    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>Latin America Developments</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, María Corina Machado, a Nobel laureate, emerged from months of hiding to collect her prize in Oslo. Her journey was conducted in secret from her home country, highlighting the ongoing political tensions in Venezuela. Meanwhile, the United States intensified its pressure on the Venezuelan government by seizing an oil tanker off its coast. Caracas condemned the US action as an "act of piracy," marking a sharp escalation in diplomatic hostilities involving Nicolás Maduro’s administration.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflicts</h2>
<p>Australia has reported a troubling rise in deaths of Indigenous people in custody, reaching the highest level since 1980. Between July last year and June of this year, 33 out of 113 deaths in custody were Indigenous individuals, raising significant concerns about systemic issues in the justice system. In Myanmar, more than 30 people were killed after a military air strike hit a hospital. The military junta has increased air bombardments in attempts to retake territory from ethnic armed groups, intensifying the conflict and humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>
<h2>Crime and Legal Issues Abroad</h2>
<p>In Thailand, two brothers, Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, owners of a nightclub in Goa, India, were detained following a deadly fire at their establishment. The brothers fled to Phuket shortly after the incident, leading to their arrest as investigations into the fire continue.</p>
<h2>Economic and Labour Issues</h2>
<p>Mexico has approved tariffs of up to 50% on imports from China and other countries. These tariffs, effective from January 1, will apply to a variety of goods including cars, clothing, and appliances. The move aims to protect domestic industries but could lead to changes in international trade dynamics. Meanwhile, Portugal experienced its first general strike in 12 years, causing widespread disruption. The strike is a response to the government’s proposed labour reforms, which appear to have caught Prime Minister Luís Montenegro by surprise due to the intense public opposition.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Topics</h2>
<p>South Korea faces renewed debate over its "cancel culture" amid a series of scandals involving three prominent entertainers in a short span of days. These events have reignited discussions about celebrity accountability and social pressures in the country. In Japan, a well-known shogi player criticized the national association for pregnancy-related policies, arguing that current rules force female players to choose between their professional careers and having children, highlighting ongoing challenges around gender equality in professional sports.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has introduced a new "gold card" visa program requiring applicants to demonstrate they can provide a "substantial benefit" to the country. These special visas carry a price tag of $1 million and are part of Trump’s latest immigration initiatives designed to attract affluent and highly skilled immigrants. The specifics of how the program will be implemented and its potential impacts remain to be seen.</p>
