    <h2>International Tensions and Sanctions</h2>
<p>The US has seized an oil tanker near Venezuela, accusing it of smuggling oil in violation of sanctions. This action marks a significant escalation in Washington's campaign of pressure against Nicolás Maduro's government, which has condemned the seizure as an "act of piracy." Investigations revealed the tanker had been masking its true location using covert methods to evade detection. This development highlights ongoing tensions over Venezuela's oil exports and the broader influence struggle in the region.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Peace Proposal Advances</h2>
<p>Ukraine has submitted a revised peace plan to the US, with Germany providing updates on its contents. The new draft reportedly includes proposals for territorial concessions, signaling a potential shift in negotiations aimed at resolving the conflict. While details remain limited, this move underscores continued diplomatic efforts to broker peace, involving key international players focused on tilting the balance towards a negotiated settlement.</p>
<h2>Political Changes in Bulgaria</h2>
<p>Bulgaria's Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov and his government resigned after widespread protests and ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence. This abrupt departure comes just 20 days before Bulgaria is scheduled to adopt the euro as its currency. The resignation adds uncertainty to the country's political landscape during a critical period of economic integration with the eurozone.</p>
<h2>Labour Unrest in Portugal</h2>
<p>Portugal experienced significant disruption during its first general strike in 12 years, opposing the government's proposed labour reforms. The strike revealed strong public resistance and appeared to catch Prime Minister Luís Montenegro off guard. This event points to rising tensions between the government and workers, which may affect social and economic policy decisions going forward.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in the US</h2>
<p>A US judge has ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, deeming his detention "without lawful authority." Garcia will temporarily return to his home in Maryland. This ruling highlights ongoing legal debates surrounding immigration enforcement and detainee rights within the US judicial system.</p>
<h2>Technology Recognition</h2>
<p>Time Magazine has named the "Architects of AI" as its Person of the Year, celebrating influential figures shaping artificial intelligence. Among them is Jensen Huang, the leader of Nvidia, whose work has significantly impacted the field. This recognition emphasizes the growing importance of AI technology and its developers in shaping the future of innovation and industry.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Ethiopia and Myanmar</h2>
<p>Ethiopian authorities arrested six TikTok creators following an awards ceremony, accusing them of "undermining public morality" due to their attire. The arrests have raised concerns about freedom of expression and cultural norms enforcement in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Myanmar has suffered a devastating air strike by its military targeting a hospital, killing more than 30 people. The strike is part of an intensified military campaign aimed at regaining control from ethnic armed groups, raising serious humanitarian and human rights worries amid the ongoing conflict.</p>
