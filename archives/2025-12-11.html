    <h2>US-Venezuela Tensions Rise as Oil Tanker Seized</h2>
<p>The United States has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, accusing it of smuggling oil in violation of sanctions. This move marks a sharp increase in pressure by Washington on Nicolás Maduro's government. Venezuela condemned the action as an "act of piracy." The tanker had been actively concealing its location to avoid detection, a tactic that involved moving between countries like Iran, China, and Venezuela. This incident underscores ongoing disputes over sanctions and enforcement in the region and may further strain US-Venezuela relations.</p>
<h2>Political Upheaval in Bulgaria Amidst Protests</h2>
<p>Bulgaria's prime minister, Rosen Zhelyazkov, and his government have resigned following widespread protests across the country. The resignation came just before a parliamentary vote of no confidence and less than a month before Bulgaria is scheduled to adopt the euro currency. These events reflect significant public dissatisfaction with the current administration and add uncertainty to the country's political and economic future as it prepares for major changes in its monetary system.</p>
<h2>Labour Unrest Causes Major Disruption in Portugal</h2>
<p>Portugal is experiencing its first general strike in 12 years, leading to severe disruption nationwide. The strike was organized in response to government labour reforms, which Prime Minister Luís Montenegro apparently underestimated in terms of public opposition. This labour action highlights growing tensions between the government and workers and signals potential challenges ahead in addressing labour policies.</p>
<h2>US Judge Orders Release of Immigration Detainee</h2>
<p>A US federal judge has ruled that detaining Kilmar Abrego Garcia was done "without lawful authority," resulting in his release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. Garcia will be allowed to return to his home in Maryland at least temporarily. This decision touches on ongoing debates about immigration enforcement and legal procedures within the United States.</p>
<h2>Time Magazine Honors AI Innovators</h2>
<p>Time Magazine named the "Architects of AI" as its Person of the Year, highlighting influential figures in the field of artificial intelligence. The cover features notable tech leaders, including Jensen Huang, head of Nvidia. This recognition emphasizes the growing impact of AI development on technology, society, and the economy.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Social Controls in Ethiopia and Myanmar</h2>
<p>In Ethiopia, six social media personalities were arrested after an awards ceremony, charged with "undermining public morality" due to what authorities deemed indecent dress. This action points to ongoing issues around social norms and government control.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Myanmar, a military air strike on a hospital killed more than 30 people. The military junta has increased air bombardments in its effort to recapture territory controlled by ethnic armed groups. This escalation in violence raises concerns about civilian safety and the fragile situation in the region.</p>
