    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The United States has seized an oil tanker near Venezuela, accusing it of smuggling oil in violation of sanctions. This action marks an escalation in the US government's efforts to pressure Nicolás Maduro's administration. Venezuela has condemned the seizure as an "act of piracy." Investigations have revealed that the tanker had been disguising its actual location to evade detection, highlighting ongoing challenges in enforcing sanctions and monitoring illicit oil shipments.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky has indicated that the US is interested in establishing a "special economic zone" in a frontline region. However, key issues such as the control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain unresolved within peace negotiations. The situation reflects ongoing tensions in the region and the complexities involved in reaching diplomatic agreements.</p>
<h2>Europe: Political and Social Developments</h2>
<p>Bulgaria is experiencing political upheaval as Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov and his government resigned ahead of an imminent vote of no confidence in parliament. This resignation comes just 20 days before Bulgaria is set to adopt the euro, marking a critical moment in the country's political and economic landscape.</p>
<p>In Austria, the government approved a new ban on headscarves for girls under the age of 14 in schools. This law follows a previous ban on headscarves for younger girls, which was struck down by the Constitutional Court for targeting Muslim communities specifically. The new measures continue to spark debate over religious expression and secular policies in European education.</p>
<h2>Labor and Social Unrest</h2>
<p>Portugal is facing significant disruptions due to its first general strike in 12 years. The strike is a response to proposed labour reforms by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro’s government, which have provoked strong opposition from workers and unions. The strike has created widespread impacts across the country and signals notable social unrest regarding employment conditions and reforms.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, a judge has ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration custody, ruling that his detention was conducted "without lawful authority." He will be allowed to return home to Maryland, at least temporarily, while further legal processes continue.</p>
<p>Ethiopian authorities have arrested several social media personalities, including Adonay Berhane and Wongelawit Gebre Endrias, following a public awards ceremony. The police accused the group of undermining public morality because of their attire, underlining ongoing tensions around cultural norms and freedom of expression in the country.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Crisis in Myanmar</h2>
<p>A recent air strike by Myanmar’s military hit a hospital, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 people. The strike is part of an intensified campaign by the military junta to regain control of territory held by ethnic armed groups. This tragic event highlights the severe humanitarian consequences of ongoing conflicts in Myanmar.</p>
