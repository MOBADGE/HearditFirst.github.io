    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 11, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Security and Sanctions</h2>
<p>The United States has sanctioned six additional ships following the recent seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela. The White House intends to move the tanker to a US port and confiscate the oil on board. This action has been strongly condemned by Caracas, which described it as an act of "international piracy." The move further escalates tensions between the US and Venezuela and reflects ongoing disputes over oil exports and regional influence.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Bulgaria’s prime minister, Rosen Zhelyazkov, and his government have resigned amid widespread protests. This unexpected resignation came just before a scheduled vote of no confidence in parliament and only 20 days ahead of Bulgaria’s planned adoption of the euro. The protests that led to this outcome reflect deep public dissatisfaction, and the political uncertainty may affect Bulgaria’s economic transition during this critical period.</p>
<p>In Portugal, the first general strike in 12 years has caused major disruption across the country. Citizens are expressing strong opposition to recent labour reforms introduced by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro’s government. The strike indicates significant public resistance to changes in labour policy, and the government may need to re-evaluate its approach to avoid further unrest.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Diplomacy in Ukraine and Myanmar</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s president has discussed prospects for a peace plan but noted that key issues remain unresolved, including control over a frontline region designated as a special economic zone and the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power facility. The region’s stability is crucial to Ukraine’s future security and economic recovery, and negotiations are ongoing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Myanmar, a recent military air strike on a hospital killed more than 30 people. The military junta has increased air bombardments in its efforts to regain territory from ethnic armed groups, deepening the long-standing conflict and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the country.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Issues</h2>
<p>In Austria, a new ban prohibits wearing headscarves in schools for children under 14 years old. This law follows a similar ban affecting girls under 10, which was previously struck down by the Constitutional Court for targeting Muslim communities specifically. The new legislation may intensify debates about religious freedom and integration.</p>
<p>Ethiopian authorities have arrested several social media personalities after an awards ceremony, accusing them of "undermining public morality" due to their clothing. This action reflects ongoing tensions regarding public conduct and cultural norms within the country.</p>
<h2>Education and Legal Matters</h2>
<p>South Korea’s chief administrator of a high-stakes English exam resigned amid controversy over the complexity of the test questions. Critics argued that the exam was too difficult, while others defended the challenging content as intentional. This event highlights ongoing debates about educational standards and fairness in competitive testing systems.</p>
<p>In the United States, a Salvadoran national named Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from immigration detention following a court ruling that found the government lacked the legal authority to continue his detention. Garcia is married to an American citizen, and the case underscores issues surrounding immigration policies and legal rights.</p>
<h2>Technology Recognition</h2>
<p>Time Magazine has named the group it calls the "Architects of AI" as its Person of the Year. Among those honored is Jensen Huang, the leader of Nvidia, a major player in artificial intelligence technology. This recognition highlights the growing influence of AI developments on society and the economy.</p>
