    <h2>Middle East Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>Tensions in the Middle East sharply increased on February 28, 2026, following a joint US-Israel attack on Iranian targets. Iran responded by launching missile strikes on Israel and other countries across the region, including Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Smoke was widely reported rising from Tehran and Manama, Bahrain, where a US Navy base was hit. The US president described the actions as "major combat operations," citing what he called an ongoing campaign of violence by the Iranian regime against the United States. This escalation has heightened concerns over regional security and the potential for further conflict.</p>
<h2>US and Israel Assess Iran’s Vulnerability</h2>
<p>Against the backdrop of military strikes, US and Israeli officials say they see a strategic opportunity. Both countries believe Iran is currently weakened by ongoing economic difficulties and recent protests within the country. This assessment shapes their approach to the current crisis, indicating they may try to capitalize on what they view as a moment of Iranian instability.</p>
<h2>Bolivia Military Plane Crash Kills at Least 20</h2>
<p>In Bolivia, a military plane carrying banknotes crashed, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people. Following the crash, police had to use tear gas to disperse crowds reportedly trying to collect the scattered banknotes at the site. The incident has caused chaos in the area and raised questions about the safety protocols for transporting valuable cargo.</p>
<h2>Canada and India Work to Strengthen Ties</h2>
<p>Efforts to improve strained relations between Canada and India are underway, with special attention on reducing dependence on the US for trade. A visit by Canadian officials to India is described as a "win-win" for both countries, indicating progress in repairing diplomatic relations. This cooperation could lead to more diversified economic partnerships in the future.</p>
<h2>US Government Halts Use of AI Company Anthropic</h2>
<p>In the United States, a standoff between the Department of Defense and the AI company Anthropic led to an order from the US president to stop government use of Anthropic’s services. This development marks a significant move in the ongoing debate over how artificial intelligence technologies are deployed within government operations.</p>
<h2>Legal Actions Continue in Minnesota Protest Case</h2>
<p>The Department of Justice has charged 30 additional individuals connected to an anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) church protest in Minnesota. Among the original nine arrested was former CNN anchor Don Lemon. The new charges reflect a continuing legal process surrounding the protest and law enforcement's response.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These events together underline ongoing international tensions, domestic legal proceedings, and efforts to reshape diplomatic and technological landscapes in early 2026.</p>
