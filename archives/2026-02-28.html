    <h2>Bill Clinton Testifies in Epstein Investigation</h2>
<p>Former US president Bill Clinton appeared before a committee and testified that he had no knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activities. Clinton stated he would never have flown on Epstein’s private plane if he had any awareness of the crimes Epstein was involved in. During the deposition, photos including one of Clinton in a hot tub surfaced, but he denied any connection to Epstein’s offenses. This testimony is part of ongoing investigations into Epstein’s network and associates.</p>
<h2>Deadly Plane Crash in Bolivia</h2>
<p>At least 15 people died after a military plane carrying banknotes crashed in Bolivia. The incident caused chaos as crowds tried to seize the banknotes scattered near the crash site. Police responded by firing tear gas to control the situation. Authorities are investigating the circumstances of the crash and managing the aftermath to prevent further unrest.</p>
<h2>US Government Ends Use of Anthropic AI Technology</h2>
<p>In a recent announcement on social media, former US leader Donald Trump ordered the government to stop using AI technology developed by Anthropic. This decision follows a conflict between Anthropic’s leadership and the US Department of Defense regarding the use of artificial intelligence. The move highlights ongoing tensions over AI regulation and government contracts in this rapidly evolving sector.</p>
<h2>Canada and India Work to Strengthen Relations</h2>
<p>Efforts to mend and improve the diplomatic and trade relationship between Canada and India are underway. The visit of a Canadian official to India marks a step towards repairing a previously strained partnership. Both countries are looking to reduce their trade dependency on the United States by fostering stronger bilateral ties. This development could lead to new economic opportunities and a shift in regional trade dynamics.</p>
<h2>Increased Charges in Minnesota Anti-ICE Protest</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has charged 30 additional people connected to a protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency at a Minnesota church. Among those initially arrested was former CNN anchor Don Lemon. The protest and subsequent legal actions reflect ongoing debates and tensions surrounding immigration policies and law enforcement tactics in the United States.</p>
