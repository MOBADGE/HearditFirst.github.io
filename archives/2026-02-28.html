    <h2>Middle East Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>A joint military action by the United States and Israel has targeted Iran, prompting Iran to respond with missile attacks aimed at Israel. Explosions have also been reported in several Gulf countries, including Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The situation remains tense as the US President announced the start of “major combat operations” against Iran, accusing the country of ongoing violence and attacks against the United States. This escalation could lead to further regional instability and international concern about broader conflict.</p>
<h2>Bill Clinton Testifies on Epstein Case</h2>
<p>Former US President Bill Clinton appeared before a committee to respond to questions related to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. Clinton denied any knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities and stated he would not have flown on Epstein’s private plane if he had suspected wrongdoing. His deposition included references to flight logs and photographs, but he maintained that he was unaware of the illegal acts committed by Epstein. This testimony is part of an ongoing inquiry into Epstein's network and associated individuals.</p>
<h2>Bolivia Plane Crash Tragedy</h2>
<p>At least 15 people have died after a military plane carrying banknotes crashed in Bolivia. Following the crash, police used tear gas to control crowds attempting to seize banknotes from the wreckage. Authorities are continuing their response to the incident as they investigate the circumstances surrounding the crash and work to maintain public order.</p>
<h2>US Government Ends Contract with Anthropic</h2>
<p>The US government has been ordered to stop using AI products from Anthropic amid a dispute between the company’s leadership and the Department of Defense. This directive was announced by US President Donald Trump via social media, signaling a significant development in the ongoing discussions over the role of artificial intelligence in government and military applications. The move may have implications for AI policy and procurement going forward.</p>
<h2>Canada and India Strengthen Ties</h2>
<p>Efforts to improve the trade relationship between Canada and India are underway, with discussions aiming to repair previously strained ties. Both countries are also looking to reduce their economic dependence on the United States, seeking a "win-win" arrangement that benefits each side. These developments could influence trade patterns and diplomatic relations in the coming years.</p>
