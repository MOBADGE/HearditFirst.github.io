    <h2>Military Conflict in Iran</h2>
<p>Explosions have been reported across Iran amid what former US president Donald Trump described as "major combat operations." These events appear to be linked to a joint military strike conducted by the United States and Israel. Smoke and disruptions have been observed in Tehran and other parts of the country. The situation remains fluid, and the reasons behind the timing and targets of the attack have yet to be fully detailed. This development marks a significant escalation in tensions in the region and could have further geopolitical implications.</p>
<h2>Bill Clinton and Epstein Investigation</h2>
<p>Former US president Bill Clinton has testified before a committee about his connections to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. During his deposition, Clinton denied having any knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities and stated he would never have flown on Epstein's private plane if he had been aware of such acts. Photographs featuring Clinton among Epstein's files have emerged, including a widely discussed hot tub photo, but Clinton maintains he was unaware of Epstein's misconduct. The testimony forms part of ongoing investigations into Epstein's network and associations.</p>
<h2>Plane Crash in Bolivia</h2>
<p>At least 15 people have died following the crash of a military plane in Bolivia. The aircraft was reportedly carrying banknotes at the time of the accident. After the crash, local police used tear gas to disperse crowds attempting to seize the banknotes scattered at the site. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash and responding to the chaotic scenes on the ground. This incident highlights challenges in managing disaster scenes where valuable cargo is involved.</p>
<h2>US Government Ends Use of Anthropic AI</h2>
<p>The US government, under the direction of President Donald Trump, has ordered agencies to stop using the artificial intelligence company Anthropic’s services. This decision follows a public standoff between Anthropic’s leadership and the US Department of Defense. Details on the reasons behind the conflict or the future of AI use within government agencies have not been confirmed. The development reflects ongoing tensions regarding the regulation and deployment of advanced AI technologies.</p>
<h2>Canada and India Seek Closer Economic Ties</h2>
<p>Canadian and Indian officials are working to improve their bilateral relationship, which has experienced strains in recent years. The visit of a Canadian representative, Mark Carney, to India is seen as a step toward strengthening economic and diplomatic ties. Both countries aim to diversify and lessen their trade dependence on the United States. This shift could reshape economic partnerships in the region and offer new opportunities for collaboration between Canada and India.</p>
<h2>Legal Actions in Minnesota Protest</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has charged 30 additional people in connection with an anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) church protest in Minnesota. The expanded list of defendants includes individuals involved in the original arrests last month, among them ex-CNN anchor Don Lemon. The protest and subsequent charges highlight ongoing debates and activism related to immigration enforcement policies in the United States. Further legal proceedings are expected as the case develops.</p>
