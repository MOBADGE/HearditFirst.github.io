    <h2>Legal Testimony of Bill Clinton</h2>
<p>Former US president Bill Clinton testified before a committee regarding his connections to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. Clinton denied any knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities, stating he would never have flown on Epstein’s plane if he had suspected wrongdoing. The testimony included references to flight logs and a controversial photo of Clinton in a hot tub with Epstein. Clinton emphasized his lack of awareness about Epstein’s crimes amidst public scrutiny tied to Epstein’s social circle.</p>
<h2>Bolivia Plane Crash</h2>
<p>A military plane carrying banknotes crashed in Bolivia, resulting in at least 15 fatalities. The incident led to chaotic scenes on the ground, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds reportedly attempting to collect banknotes scattered near the crash site. Authorities are managing the aftermath amid concerns over public safety and the investigation into the cause of the crash.</p>
<h2>US Government AI Policy Shift</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump issued an order for the government to stop using AI services provided by the company Anthropic. This directive follows a dispute between Anthropic’s leadership and the US Ministry of Defense. The move reflects an ongoing battle over the development and control of artificial intelligence technologies within the government, hinting at further regulatory or strategic shifts in AI use.</p>
<h2>Canada-India Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>Amid efforts to mend a previously strained relationship, representatives from Canada and India are engaging in discussions to reduce their economic dependence on the United States. The visit by a Canadian official named Carney to India has been portrayed as a “win-win” opportunity for Indian Prime Minister Modi. This diplomatic effort signals a shift in trade alliances and broader economic cooperation between the two nations.</p>
<h2>Legal Actions in Minnesota Protest</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has charged 30 additional individuals linked to an anti-ICE protest at a church in Minnesota. The protest initially drew attention when nine defendants, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, were arrested last month. These new charges indicate escalating legal responses to the protest activities surrounding immigration enforcement policies.</p>
<h2>Explosions in Iran</h2>
<p>Reports of explosions and rising smoke have been heard across Iran, indicating a series of events escalating regional tensions. The situation has drawn international attention, with former US president Donald Trump commenting that “major combat operations” have begun. The developments are causing concern about potential wider conflict in the Middle East.</p>
