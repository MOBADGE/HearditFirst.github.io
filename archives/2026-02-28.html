    <h2>Middle East Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>The United States and Israel have conducted a joint attack on targets in Iran, prompting a missile retaliation from Iran aimed at Israel. Explosions have also been reported in several Gulf states, including Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. US President Donald Trump announced the start of "major combat operations" against Iran, accusing the Iranian regime of a continuous campaign of violence targeting the United States. The situation remains tense as military and political developments continue in the region.</p>
<h2>Bill Clinton Testifies About Epstein Links</h2>
<p>Former US President Bill Clinton gave testimony denying any knowledge of crimes committed by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In his deposition, Clinton said he would not have flown on Epstein's private plane if he had suspected any illegal activity. The testimony was part of an ongoing investigation and addresses photographs and flight logs that have connected Clinton to Epstein. Clinton emphasized his lack of awareness about Epstein’s offenses.</p>
<h2>Bolivia Military Plane Crash</h2>
<p>A military plane carrying banknotes crashed in Bolivia, killing at least 15 people. Following the crash, police used tear gas to disperse crowds reportedly attempting to take banknotes from the scene. The circumstances of the crash and the reasons for transporting large amounts of currency are under investigation, with authorities focusing on both rescue and security efforts at the site.</p>
<h2>US Halts Use of Anthropic AI</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump ordered the federal government to stop using services from the AI company Anthropic amid a dispute involving the US Department of Defense and the company’s leadership. The decision was shared publicly on social media and reflects ongoing tensions over the government's use of artificial intelligence technologies. Further developments in this standoff may influence government policy on AI deployment.</p>
<h2>Canada and India Work on Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>Canada and India are in the process of repairing a previously strained bilateral relationship as they seek to reduce dependence on US trade. Canadian official Mark Carney visited India, describing the situation as requiring a "delicate" balance, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a "win-win" for both nations. The efforts aim to strengthen economic ties and explore new trade partnerships outside traditional US markets.</p>
