    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise After Iran’s Retaliatory Strikes</h2>
<p>Iran launched retaliatory missile strikes across the Middle East, targeting several US military bases and civilian sites, including locations in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE. One notable civilian target hit was the Fairmont The Palm hotel in Dubai, which caught fire. Explosions have been reported in multiple countries in the Gulf region amid this escalation. These strikes follow an attack on the Supreme Leader’s compound in Iran, marking a sharp increase in regional tensions.</p>
<p>The strike on the US Navy base in Bahrain is causing concern in Washington and among its allies, raising questions about the readiness of US air defenses in the region. Both Israel and the US see this period as a critical moment, viewing Iran’s government as vulnerable due to ongoing economic troubles and recent nationwide protests. Despite the dangers, officials believe there may be an opportunity to address some of the underlying issues related to Iran’s regime.</p>
<h2>Impact on Iran’s Population Amid Internet Blackout</h2>
<p>Inside Iran, people are experiencing a mix of fear and cautious relief as the missile strikes and retaliations unfold. Widespread internet blackouts have limited their ability to communicate and access information. Many Iranians are trying to navigate the uncertainty, with some seeing the events as a sign of potential change or respite from ongoing political pressures. However, the general atmosphere remains tense as retaliation continues and further developments unfold.</p>
<h2>Bolivia Plane Crash Kills at Least 20</h2>
<p>In Bolivia, a military plane carrying banknotes crashed, killing at least 20 people. After the crash, police used tear gas to disperse crowds attempting to gather banknotes scattered at the crash site. The incident adds to the country’s challenges and is currently under investigation. Authorities have focused on securing the site amid the chaotic response by locals.</p>
<h2>US Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Former US President Bill Clinton testified before a committee, denying any knowledge of crimes related to Jeffrey Epstein. Clinton stated he would never have flown on Epstein’s plane had he known of such activities. This testimony comes as part of ongoing scrutiny related to Epstein’s network.</p>
<p>Separately, former CNN anchor Don Lemon is among more than 30 people charged by the US Department of Justice in connection with an anti-ICE protest at a church in Minnesota. The expanded charges mark a significant step in the government's response to the protest activities.</p>
<h2>US Government Limits Use of Anthropic AI Technology</h2>
<p>In a move announced via social media, the US government has ordered a stop to using AI technology from the company Anthropic. The decision follows a standoff between Anthropic’s leadership and the US Department of Defense regarding the use and oversight of artificial intelligence. This reflects growing tensions around AI regulation and its applications in government and defense sectors.</p>
