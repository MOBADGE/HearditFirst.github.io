    <h2>Bill Clinton’s Testimony on Epstein Case</h2>
<p>Former US President Bill Clinton testified before a committee regarding his connections to Jeffrey Epstein. He denied any knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities and stated he would never have flown on Epstein’s private plane if he had any suspicion about such behavior. Clinton appeared in some photographs found in the Epstein files, including one with him in a hot tub, but he maintained that these images and flight logs do not indicate any wrongdoing on his part. The testimony is part of ongoing investigations into Epstein’s network and associates.</p>
<h2>Bolivia Plane Crash and Aftermath</h2>
<p>At least 15 people have died in Bolivia after a military plane carrying banknotes crashed. Following the accident, police used tear gas to disperse crowds who were reportedly trying to take money from the crash site. The incident has raised concerns about safety standards in military transport and the challenges of managing public order amid emergencies.</p>
<h2>US Government Stops Using Anthropic AI</h2>
<p>A recent decision by former US President Donald Trump has directed the government to cease using technology from Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company. This action followed a standoff between Anthropic’s leadership and the Ministry of Defense. The move highlights tensions surrounding the adoption and regulation of AI technologies within government sectors, especially regarding national security and defense applications.</p>
<h2>Canada and India Seek Closer Ties</h2>
<p>Canadian official Mark Carney visited India to work on improving diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. Both nations aim to repair previously strained ties while simultaneously reducing their trade dependence on the United States. The engagement between Canada and India is seen as a strategic effort to diversify economic partnerships and strengthen cooperation in a rapidly changing global trade environment.</p>
<h2>Minnesota Anti-ICE Protest Charges Expanded</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has charged 30 additional people connected to an anti-ICE church protest in Minnesota. This expands the number of defendants previously arrested, which included former CNN anchor Don Lemon among the initial nine. The protest focused on opposition to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the ongoing legal actions reflect broader discussions about immigration enforcement and civil dissent in the country.</p>
