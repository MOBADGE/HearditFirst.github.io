    <h2>Middle East Tensions Escalate with Iran Retaliatory Strikes</h2>
<p>Smoke and flames were seen rising from Dubai's Fairmont The Palm hotel as Iran launched retaliatory strikes across the Middle East. These attacks targeted civilian sites and US military bases, including a strike on a US Navy base in Bahrain. This has raised concerns in Washington and among its regional allies regarding the effectiveness of American air defenses. US President Donald Trump has announced the start of "major combat operations" against Iran, blaming the Iranian regime for a continuous campaign of violence against the United States. The developments signal a significant escalation in the ongoing regional conflict and could lead to further military and diplomatic repercussions.</p>
<h2>Political Upheaval in Nepal Amid Focus on Corruption</h2>
<p>Nepal is experiencing a shift in its political landscape as public frustration with corruption takes center stage during elections. The previous wave of protests that led to the government's downfall highlighted widespread anger about the presence of politicians' children, often referred to as 'nepo kids,' in government roles. However, current political debates are now focusing more on addressing corruption, suggesting a change in voter priorities. This shift may influence upcoming election outcomes and the country’s efforts toward political reform.</p>
<h2>Bolivian Military Plane Crash Causes Fatalities and Crowd Unrest</h2>
<p>At least 20 people have died following the crash of a military plane carrying banknotes in Bolivia. The incident sparked chaos as crowds reportedly attempted to take banknotes from the crash site. Police responded by using tear gas to disperse these crowds, underscoring challenges in managing public disorder post-crash. The circumstances around the crash are under investigation, and the tragedy has had immediate implications for local security and safety.</p>
<h2>Bill Clinton Addresses Epstein Allegations in Deposition</h2>
<p>Former US President Bill Clinton testified before a committee, denying any knowledge of criminal activities tied to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. During the deposition, Clinton was questioned about photographs linking him to Epstein, including a notable hot tub image, which he addressed calmly. Clinton stated he would not have flown on Epstein's plane had he suspected any wrongdoing. His testimony forms part of broader inquiries into Epstein’s network and raises public interest in the extent of involvement by prominent figures.</p>
<h2>US Government Ends Contract with Anthropic Amid AI Dispute</h2>
<p>The US government has ordered a stop to its use of services from Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, following a standoff between Anthropic's leadership and the Department of Defense. The announcement came via social media and reflects ongoing tensions over AI technology applications within government and military operations. This decision highlights the complexities and challenges involved in managing AI partnerships and the strategic role AI is playing in national security considerations.</p>
<h2>Minnesota Anti-ICE Protest Leads to New DOJ Charges</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has charged 30 additional individuals connected to a protest at a church in Minnesota opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities. Among the original nine arrested last month was former CNN anchor Don Lemon. The expanded charges indicate a sustained government effort to hold protesters accountable and enforce legal boundaries around such demonstrations. This situation remains a focal point in ongoing debates about immigration enforcement and civil activism.</p>
