    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise After Iranian Strikes</h2>
<p>Smoke and flames were reported at Dubai’s Fairmont The Palm hotel following a series of Iranian retaliatory strikes across the Middle East. These attacks targeted civilian areas as well as US military bases in the region. One notable strike hit a US Navy base in Bahrain, raising concerns about the effectiveness of American air defenses. The situation has heightened worries among Washington and its regional allies about escalating conflict. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump announced the start of "major combat operations" against Iran, condemning the regime for its prolonged campaign of violence against the United States. These developments signal a potentially dangerous intensification of hostilities in the region.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in Nepal Over Corruption and Nepotism</h2>
<p>In Nepal, widespread public anger over political corruption and the dominance of politicians' children, often referred to as "nepo kids," has remained a key issue since protests toppled the government last year. The spotlight on nepotism has driven calls for reform and greater accountability within the political system. The current election cycle continues to be influenced by these concerns, as voters and observers watch closely for signs of change amid frustrations with entrenched political families.</p>
<h2>Fatal Plane Crash in Bolivia Sparks Chaos</h2>
<p>A military plane carrying banknotes crashed in Bolivia, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people. The crash site became chaotic as police used tear gas to disperse crowds attempting to seize the fallen banknotes. The circumstances surrounding the crash and the large crowd's reaction highlight the volatility and economic tensions present in the country.</p>
<h2>Bill Clinton Testifies on Epstein Case</h2>
<p>Former US President Bill Clinton appeared before a congressional committee to answer questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. Clinton denied any knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities and stated he would never have flown on Epstein’s plane had he suspected wrongdoing. The deposition included references to flight logs and photographs, but Clinton maintained ignorance of Epstein’s crimes during his testimony.</p>
<h2>US Government Ends Use of Anthropic AI Technology</h2>
<p>In the United States, President Donald Trump ordered a halt to government use of AI services supplied by Anthropic, a company involved in a dispute with the Department of Defense. The decision was announced via social media, reflecting ongoing tensions over the role of AI technology in government and military applications. The move underscores the complex dynamics between AI developers and federal agencies in shaping future technology policies.</p>
<h2>Expanded Charges in Minnesota Anti-ICE Protests</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice has charged 30 additional people connected to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that took place in Minnesota. These new charges come alongside earlier arrests, including those of nine initial defendants, among them former CNN anchor Don Lemon. The legal actions highlight ongoing national debates around immigration enforcement and public demonstrations.</p>
