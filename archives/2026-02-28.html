    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise as Iran Launches Retaliatory Strikes</h2>
<p>Iran has carried out missile strikes across the region targeting Israel and several Gulf countries, including Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. These attacks come amid heightened tensions following speculation about the death of Iran's Supreme Leader. Explosions have been reported in multiple locations, and Dubai’s Fairmont The Palm hotel was struck, causing visible smoke and flames. Civilian sites, alongside US military bases such as a Navy base in Bahrain, have been targeted. This development raises serious concerns in Washington and its allies about the vulnerability of air defenses in the region.</p>
<h2>Impact on Iran and Regional Reactions</h2>
<p>Inside Iran, despite an almost total internet blackout, people express mixed feelings. Some experience panic due to the strikes and ongoing unrest, while others see this moment as a form of relief amid current troubles. The country is coping with economic difficulties and the aftermath of recent protests, which some US and Israeli officials view as a sign of vulnerability for Iran’s leadership. The situation remains volatile, with potential implications for regional stability and international relations.</p>
<h2>Bolivia Plane Crash Kills at Least 20</h2>
<p>In Bolivia, at least 20 people have died after a military plane carrying banknotes crashed. Authorities had to use tear gas to disperse crowds reportedly trying to seize banknotes from the crash site. The crash adds to concerns about safety and control during emergencies involving potentially valuable cargo, and investigations are likely underway to determine the cause of the accident.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>Former US president Bill Clinton testified before a committee, denying any knowledge of criminal activities by Jeffrey Epstein. He stated he would not have flown on Epstein’s plane if he had suspected wrongdoing. Meanwhile, former CNN anchor Don Lemon was among those charged in connection with an anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) church protest in Minnesota. The US Department of Justice has now charged 30 additional people in this case.</p>
<p>In a separate matter, former US president Donald Trump has ordered the government to stop using services from the artificial intelligence company Anthropic. This action follows a standoff between Anthropic’s leadership and the US Department of Defense, highlighting growing tensions over AI technology and its use in government and military contexts.</p>
<h2>International Relations: Canada, India, and Trade</h2>
<p>Canada and India are working to mend a previously strained relationship. With a focus on reducing reliance on trade with the United States, Canadian official Mark Carney’s visit to India is viewed as a "win-win" opportunity by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Both countries are seeking to strike a balance between economic interests and geopolitical strategy as they navigate new collaborative efforts.</p>
