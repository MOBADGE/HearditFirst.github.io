    <h2>Bill Clinton's Testimony on Epstein Connections</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Bill Clinton testified before a committee about his associations with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. During the deposition, Clinton denied any knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities and stressed that he would not have flown on Epstein's private plane if he had "any inkling" of wrongdoing. The hearing also addressed images linked to Epstein, including a widely circulated photo of Clinton in a hot tub with a woman inside Epstein's residence. Clinton maintained that he was unaware of the misconduct associated with Epstein. This testimony is part of a broader investigation into Epstein's network and those connected to him.</p>
<h2>Deadly Plane Crash in Bolivia</h2>
<p>At least 15 people have died following the crash of a military plane carrying banknotes in Bolivia. The incident occurred under circumstances that led to chaos at the crash site, where local police had to use tear gas to control crowds attempting to seize banknotes from the wreckage. The crash has raised concerns over security and safety around transport of high-value cargo by military aircraft. Authorities continue to investigate the cause of the crash and manage the situation to prevent further unrest.</p>
<h2>U.S. Government Ends Use of Anthropic AI Services</h2>
<p>The U.S. government has been ordered not to use artificial intelligence services from the company Anthropic. This directive came from former U.S. President Donald Trump and was announced via social media. The decision followed a standoff between Anthropic's leadership and the Ministry of Defense over the use of AI technologies. This development highlights ongoing tensions and evolving policies about AI deployment in government sectors, particularly regarding national security implications.</p>
<h2>Canada and India Strengthen Ties Amid Trade Realignments</h2>
<p>Efforts to rebuild the relationship between Canada and India continue with a visit by Mark Carney, a Canadian official, to India. Both countries are working to improve diplomatic ties while seeking to reduce their economic dependence on the United States. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described this cooperation as a "win-win" situation, emphasizing mutual benefits. The partnership aims to create a more balanced trading landscape and deepen cooperation on various fronts.</p>
<h2>Expanded Charges in Minnesota Church Protest</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged 30 additional individuals related to an anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protest at a church in Minnesota. The original group included nine defendants arrested last month, among them former CNN anchor Don Lemon. The ongoing legal actions reflect increased federal efforts to address civil disobedience and protests surrounding immigration enforcement policies. The case continues to draw public and media attention as it develops.</p>
