    <div class="date">December 21, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Human Rights</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has reached a new high in executions this year, with at least 347 people put to death. The UK-based rights group Reprieve has condemned the surge, highlighting growing concerns over human rights practices in the country. The increase in executions marks a record level for Saudi Arabia in 2025.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Israel has approved the construction of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stated the purpose of this move is to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, grassroots families of hostages in Israel, with only one hostage remaining in Gaza, have become an influential force both domestically and internationally as they continue to seek the safe return of captives.</p>
<h2>US-Venezuela Relations</h2>
<p>The United States seized a second oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast as part of an ongoing strategy initiated by US President Donald Trump, who ordered a blockade on oil tankers sanctioned against Venezuela. This move intensifies tensions between the two countries as the US attempts to enforce economic sanctions more aggressively.</p>
<h2>Australia and South Africa Incidents</h2>
<p>In Australia, a minute’s silence was held to remember the victims of the Bondi Beach attack. The event was marked by a negative reaction towards Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who was booed upon arrival. In South Africa, a deadly attack at a tavern in Bekkersdal left nine people dead and 10 injured after gunmen opened fire and continued shooting indiscriminately.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>India faced a tragic accident in the north-eastern state of Assam where an express train killed seven elephants attempting to cross railway tracks. In entertainment, comedian Bowen Yang announced his departure from the television show *Saturday Night Live*. Yang is also known for hosting a podcast and starring in the *Wicked* film series.</p>
<p>Additionally, the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein has stirred mixed reactions. US lawmakers who advocated for the files to be public have criticized the initial release for being incomplete. The long-awaited documents include references to several high-profile figures such as Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson, contributing to ongoing public interest and scrutiny.</p>
