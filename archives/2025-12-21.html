    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 21, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Energy and Sanctions</h2>
<p>The United States is reportedly pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela, following President Donald Trump's recent order to blockade sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving the country. This move intensifies the pressure on Venezuela amid ongoing political and economic tensions. By targeting these vessels, the US aims to enforce sanctions more strictly and limit Venezuela's oil exports. The situation is likely to affect international oil markets and relations between the involved countries in the near term.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Political Developments in Myanmar</h2>
<p>In Myanmar, civilians in rebel-held areas face severe challenges ahead of a government-mandated election scheduled for this month. The BBC reports on the devastating air strikes disrupting daily life and raising concerns about the election's legitimacy in conflict zones. The combination of ongoing violence and a contested electoral process underscores the fragile state of Myanmar’s political environment and the potential for continued instability.</p>
<h2>Israeli Settlement Expansion</h2>
<p>Israel has approved the construction of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich described the decision as aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state. This development is significant as it impacts the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and could influence future peace negotiations, potentially increasing tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Executions in Saudi Arabia</h2>
<p>Human rights organizations have condemned Saudi Arabia after it recorded a new high in executions this year, with at least 347 people put to death. The UK-based campaign group Reprieve highlighted this alarming figure, which raises questions about the kingdom's justice system and human rights practices. The increase in executions continues to draw international criticism and could affect Saudi Arabia's global relations.</p>
<h2>Violence in South Africa and Australia</h2>
<p>A tragic attack occurred in a South African tavern in Bekkersdal, where gunmen killed nine people and injured ten more, randomly shooting during the assault. This incident adds to ongoing concerns about violent crime in the region.</p>
<p>Separately, Australia continues to deal with the aftermath of the Bondi shooting and a deadly stabbing attack last year. Survivors remain physically and emotionally scarred, reflecting the long-lasting impact of such violent events on communities and highlighting the need for support and prevention strategies.</p>
<h2>Cultural News: Bowen Yang Exits Saturday Night Live</h2>
<p>Comedian Bowen Yang, a prominent cast member of Saturday Night Live, announced that he will be leaving the show. Yang is also known for hosting a podcast and starring in the Wicked film series. His departure marks a notable change for the long-running comedy program and its audience.</p>
