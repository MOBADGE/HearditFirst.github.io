    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 21, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Conflicts and Settlements</h2>
<p>Israel has approved the establishment of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stated that the move aims to prevent the formation of a Palestinian state. This decision could increase tensions in the region and affect ongoing peace discussions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a group of families of hostages in Gaza has gained recognition for its influence in Israel and internationally. With only one hostage remaining in Gaza, members of this grassroots forum reflect on their role advocating for those held captive. Their efforts highlight the human impact behind the conflict and the continuing challenges faced by families.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Executions</h2>
<p>Rights organizations have condemned Saudi Arabia for reaching a new record high in executions this year. According to the UK-based campaign group Reprieve, at least 347 people have been executed so far in 2025. This surge in capital punishment has drawn criticism from human rights advocates who urge the kingdom to reconsider its policies and respect international human rights standards.</p>
<h2>Security and Violence</h2>
<p>South Africa witnessed a tragic incident when gunmen attacked a tavern in Bekkersdal, killing nine people and injuring ten others. Reports indicate the perpetrators opened fire and continued shooting randomly, causing panic and devastation in the community. Authorities are investigating the attack amid concerns about ongoing violence in the region.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, the United States seized a second oil tanker off the country’s coast. This action follows US President Donald Trump's order to impose a "blockade" on oil tankers sanctioned for entering or leaving Venezuela. The seizure represents an escalation in US efforts to pressure the Venezuelan government over political and economic disputes.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife have been handed additional jail terms related to a state gift fraud case. Imran Khan, who is already serving a prison sentence, intends to challenge the new verdict. This development adds complexity to Pakistan's political landscape and could influence future legal and political proceedings.</p>
<p>In the United States, survivors and lawmakers have expressed unease over the initial release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. Lawmakers who advocated for making the files public have criticized the release as incomplete, leaving survivors "nervous and sceptical." The situation underscores ongoing tensions about transparency and justice in the Epstein case.</p>
<h2>Environment and Wildlife</h2>
<p>In India’s northeastern state of Assam, an express train struck and killed seven elephants crossing the railway tracks. The incident occurred early on Saturday and has brought attention to the dangers faced by wildlife near human infrastructure. Local officials may need to explore measures to prevent such tragic collisions in the future.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>Comedian Bowen Yang has announced he will leave the cast of "Saturday Night Live." Yang has been one of the show’s most prominent members and also hosts a podcast and stars in the "Wicked" film series. His departure marks a significant change for the program and fans of his work.</p>
