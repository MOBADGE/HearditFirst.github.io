    <h2>International Maritime Enforcement</h2>
<p>US forces seized two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil in predawn operations across the North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. These vessels were identified as part of a "shadow fleet" involved in transporting Venezuelan oil, a move reflecting ongoing US efforts to pressure Venezuela’s government and control illicit oil shipments. The seizures underscore heightened US vigilance in maritime operations and may increase tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Greenland Purchase Discussions Stir Controversy</h2>
<p>The White House confirmed that Donald Trump is actively discussing the possibility of buying Greenland, a large island currently governed by Denmark. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stated the island is not for sale. Greenland residents expressed fear and indignation about the prospect, emphasizing they do not want to become part of the United States. The situation highlights geopolitical interest in Greenland’s strategic location and resources but also diplomatic sensitivities and local opposition.</p>
<h2>Changes in Venezuelan Military Leadership</h2>
<p>Venezuela’s interim leader removed General Javier Marcano Tábata, who commanded the inner circle responsible for protecting Nicolás Maduro. This change signals internal shifts within Venezuela’s military and political landscape amid ongoing instability. It may affect power dynamics involving Maduro’s regime as the interim government consolidates control.</p>
<h2>Harsh Winter Disrupts European Travel and Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Western Europe experienced major travel chaos due to a severe freeze. Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport alone canceled over 700 flights on Wednesday. In Germany, a power outage in Berlin caused by a suspected arson attack highlighted the country’s vulnerability to sabotage, occurring amid plunging temperatures. These events demonstrate the challenges European infrastructure faces in extreme weather and potential security threats during winter.</p>
<h2>Cultural Farewell in Saint-Tropez</h2>
<p>Large crowds gathered in the streets of Saint-Tropez to honor the funeral of the late French film star Brigitte Bardot. Despite her wishes for a subdued ceremony, local residents sought to pay tribute to the iconic actress in a public manner, reflecting her enduring cultural impact in France.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Swiss Ski Bar Raises Safety Concerns</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities revealed that the ski bar in Crans-Montana, where a New Year’s Eve fire killed 40 and injured 116, had not been inspected for several years. Families affected by the tragedy expressed shock over the lack of safety oversight. The incident raises questions about regulatory enforcement and could prompt stricter safety measures in Switzerland’s hospitality venues.</p>
