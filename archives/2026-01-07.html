    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Geopolitics</h2>
<p>The United States seized two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil operations during early morning raids in the North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. The ships, described as part of a "shadow fleet," are believed to be involved in activities that have raised security and regulatory concerns. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s interim leader removed General Javier Marcano Tábata, who commanded the protective guard for Nicolás Maduro, signifying possible shifts in the country's power structure.</p>
<p>In another geopolitical development, former US President Donald Trump has reportedly been actively discussing the possibility of purchasing Greenland. Both Greenland and Denmark, which owns the territory, have firmly stated that the island is not for sale. This discussion could have implications for US-Danish relations and Arctic geopolitics.</p>
<h2>Middle East Political Tensions</h2>
<p>Yemen is experiencing heightened tensions as Saudi Arabia targeted the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council forces in recent strikes. The Yemeni presidency accused Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the separatist leader of the council, of treason and expelled him after he missed scheduled talks in Riyadh. This move could further complicate the conflicted political landscape and ongoing peace efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, released a report accusing Israel of imposing policies in the West Bank that "resemble an apartheid system," citing systemic discrimination against Palestinians. The Israeli government dismissed these accusations as "absurd," indicating continued disagreement and tension over the issue.</p>
<h2>Europe Faces Severe Winter Disruptions</h2>
<p>A major cold snap has caused widespread travel chaos in Western Europe. Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport alone cancelled over 700 flights on Wednesday due to icy conditions and poor weather. In Germany, a power outage in Berlin—thought to have been caused by arson—occurred as temperatures fell below freezing, exposing vulnerabilities in the city’s infrastructure amid harsh weather. These events highlight challenges European countries face in managing infrastructure and transportation during extreme winter conditions.</p>
<h2>Tragedy and Safety Concerns in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Families and communities remain in shock after the deadly New Year's Eve fire at a ski bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, which killed 40 people and injured 116. Investigations revealed the establishment had not undergone safety inspections for several years, raising serious questions about regulation and enforcement practices in public venues. Authorities are now under pressure to review safety protocols to prevent such disasters in the future.</p>
<h2>Conservation Milestone in Africa</h2>
<p>In positive news, trackers in Virunga National Park, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, recently spotted rare mountain gorilla twins being cared for by their mother. Virunga is Africa’s oldest national park, and such births are significant for the conservation of this critically endangered species. The event offers hope for ongoing wildlife protection efforts in the region.</p>
<h2>International Crime and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Cambodia extradited Chen Zhi, accused of masterminding a large global fraud operation using his business as a front for scam activities. The extradition to China follows his arrest in Cambodia and marks a step forward in international cooperation to combat cross-border financial crime. Authorities are continuing to address the impact of such scams on victims worldwide.</p>
