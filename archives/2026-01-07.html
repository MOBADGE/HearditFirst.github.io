    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security</h2>
<p>US forces seized two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil in operations conducted before dawn in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea. These ships are described as part of a "shadow fleet," suggesting involvement in illicit or covert activities involving Venezuelan oil exports. The seizure reflects ongoing tensions around Venezuelan energy resources and efforts to enforce sanctions or control shipping routes.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, the nation’s interim leader dismissed General Javier Marcano Tábata, who commanded the inner circle of guards responsible for protecting Nicolás Maduro. This move indicates a shift in the security apparatus amid the country’s complex political climate.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Developments</h2>
<p>There are renewed reports that Donald Trump is actively considering a potential purchase of Greenland. The White House confirmed discussions are ongoing, despite repeated statements from Greenland and the Danish government that the island is not for sale. This highlights persistent geopolitical interest in Greenland’s strategic location and resources.</p>
<p>In another international legal matter, Cambodia extradited Chen Zhi, alleged mastermind of a global scam network, to China. Chen is accused of turning his business enterprises into fronts for widespread fraud targeting victims worldwide, evidencing ongoing efforts to tackle transnational financial crimes.</p>
<h2>Middle East Concerns</h2>
<p>The United Nations human rights chief, Volker Türk, released a report stating that Israeli policies in the West Bank display "systemic discrimination" against Palestinians, likening them to an apartheid system. Israel strongly rejected the accusations, describing the report as "absurd." This development underscores continuing international debates and conflicts regarding human rights and governance in the region.</p>
<h2>European Challenges</h2>
<p>Western Europe is facing significant travel disruption due to a major cold snap. Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport alone canceled over 700 flights, creating chaos for travelers. The cold weather also contributed to a power outage in Berlin caused by a suspected arson attack. This incident highlighted Germany’s vulnerability to sabotage, particularly during periods of extreme weather.</p>
<h2>Wildlife Conservation</h2>
<p>In a rare and positive development, twin mountain gorillas were born in Virunga National Park, the oldest national park in Africa, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Trackers recently spotted the babies being cared for by their mother. This event is significant for conservation efforts aimed at protecting one of the world’s most endangered primate species.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Security Situation</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that he has not received clear security guarantees from international allies. This comes shortly after announcements by the UK and France that they would consider deploying troops to Ukraine should a peace agreement with Russia be reached. Zelensky’s comments highlight ongoing uncertainty about international military support as talks continue.</p>
