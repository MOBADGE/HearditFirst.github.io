    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>The United States has seized two tankers described as part of a "shadow fleet" linked to Venezuelan oil. These operations took place in predawn raids in both the North Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea. The move is part of efforts to disrupt Venezuelan oil transport, reflecting ongoing geopolitical tensions involving the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House has confirmed that former US President Donald Trump is actively discussing the possibility of acquiring Greenland. This announcement comes despite repeated statements from both Greenland and Denmark that the island is not for sale. The prospect of the US annexing Greenland has caused concern and indignation among Greenlanders, who have expressed to the BBC that they have no interest in becoming American territory.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Global Politics</h2>
<p>The United Nations human rights chief, Volker Türk, has released a report accusing Israeli policies in the West Bank of resembling an apartheid system. The report alleges "systemic discrimination" against Palestinians. The Israeli government has dismissed these claims as "absurd." This latest development underscores ongoing international disputes surrounding Israeli-Palestinian relations and human rights concerns.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Legal News</h2>
<p>In Los Angeles, Nick Reiner, the son of Hollywood director Rob Reiner, appeared in court in connection with a murder case. His original lawyer has withdrawn from the case, and he is now represented by a public defender. Details about the case are limited, but this legal change is a significant procedural update.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, families are expressing shock after revelations that a ski bar in Crans-Montana, where a tragic New Year's Eve fire resulted in 40 deaths and 116 injuries, had not undergone safety inspections for several years. The lack of prior inspections has raised concerns about regulatory oversight and safety enforcement at public venues.</p>
<h2>Environment and Wildlife</h2>
<p>In positive news from Africa, rare mountain gorilla twins have been born in the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Trackers observed the newborns being cared for by their mother, marking a hopeful moment for conservation efforts in the world’s oldest national park.</p>
<h2>Weather and Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Western Europe is experiencing severe travel disruption due to a big freeze. At Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, more than 700 flights were canceled, affecting thousands of passengers. Similarly, Germany faced a power outage in Berlin caused by a suspected arson attack, occurring at a time when temperatures fell below freezing. The blackout highlighted concerns about infrastructure vulnerabilities to sabotage and the risks posed by harsh winter conditions.</p>
<h2>Cultural Events</h2>
<p>In France, crowds gathered in Saint-Tropez to honor the funeral of beloved film star Brigitte Bardot. Although Bardot had requested a funeral without public fanfare, locals turned out to pay their respects and celebrate her legacy in the cinematic arts.</p>
