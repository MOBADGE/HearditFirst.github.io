    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 07, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The United States plans to discuss ownership of Greenland with Denmark next week, following recent concerns about US claims to the Danish territory. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the upcoming talks, indicating ongoing diplomatic engagement between the two countries on this matter.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, significant political changes continue to unfold. Venezuela’s interim leader has removed General Javier Marcano Tábata, who was responsible for commanding the inner circle of security protecting Nicolás Maduro. Separately, opposition leader María Corina Machado has stated that her coalition should lead Venezuela. Her declaration was met with dismissal from Donald Trump, who questioned her support and respect within the country.</p>
<h2>Security and Political Unrest</h2>
<p>The junta in Burkina Faso reported foiling a plot to assassinate Capt Traoré, the country's leader. The security minister accused neighboring Ivory Coast of funding the assassination attempt, adding tension to regional relations.</p>
<p>In Yemen, tensions are escalating as the presidency has expelled Aidarous al-Zubaidi, leader of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, on charges of treason. Al-Zubaidi was accused of failing to attend talks in Riyadh, and the move highlights ongoing instability and conflict in the region. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has intensified strikes on Yemen’s southern forces.</p>
<h2>Europe Travel and Safety</h2>
<p>Western Europe experienced significant travel disruption due to a severe cold snap. Over 700 flights were canceled on Wednesday at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport alone, causing widespread travel chaos. The extreme weather has impacted transportation networks and raised safety concerns for travelers.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, families of victims are expressing shock after learning that a ski bar in Crans-Montana, where a deadly New Year's Eve fire killed 40 people and injured 116, had not been inspected for years. The lack of recent safety inspections is prompting questions about regulatory oversight and fire prevention measures in public venues.</p>
<h2>Wildlife Conservation</h2>
<p>In a positive development for wildlife conservation, rare mountain gorilla twins were born in the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Trackers spotted the newborns being cared for by their mother, marking a hopeful moment for the preservation of this endangered species in Africa’s oldest national park.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed uncertainty over clear security guarantees from international allies amid ongoing conflict with Russia. The remarks follow statements from the UK and France, which said they would deploy troops to Ukraine if a peace agreement is reached. The situation underscores the complexity of securing lasting support for Ukraine’s defense efforts.</p>
<h2>Energy and Economy</h2>
<p>In energy news, Donald Trump announced that Venezuela would be "turning over" up to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States. He also suggested that US oil firms could resume operations in Venezuela within 18 months, indicating potential changes in US-Venezuelan economic relations and a possible increase in oil supply to the US market.</p>
