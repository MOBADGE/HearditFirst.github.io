    <h2>Minneapolis Shooting and Public Reaction</h2>
<p>Federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse and US citizen, in Minneapolis. Officials said the agents fired in self-defense, but Pretti’s parents have strongly denied this, calling the claims "sickening lies." The shooting has fueled protests near the scene, where demonstrators have been chanting Pretti's name. This incident is notable as Pretti is the second person shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis this month, raising concerns about federal law enforcement practices in the city.</p>

Some analysts suggest that figures like Donald Trump may be symptoms of deeper systemic ruptures rather than root causes. This evolving order may require middle powers to navigate uncertain diplomatic and economic environments going forward.</p>
