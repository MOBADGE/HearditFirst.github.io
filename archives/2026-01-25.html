    <h2>Minneapolis Shooting and Memorial</h2>
<p>Video footage has captured the moments leading up to the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Pretti, an intensive care nurse known for his passion for mountain biking and the outdoors, was killed recently, prompting community mourning. The video offers a rare glimpse into the incident that ended his life and has drawn public attention. His death highlights concerns about violence and safety in the city.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>Venezuela has released dozens of political prisoners in the wake of U.S. authorities seizing President Nicolás Maduro during a raid. Human rights groups confirmed this latest group of detainees freed, signaling a potential shift in the country’s political landscape. This development may influence ongoing tensions between Venezuela, the United States, and other international actors involved in the crisis.</p>
<h2>Severe Flooding in Mozambique</h2>
<p>Mozambique is experiencing the worst flooding seen in a generation. The disaster forced many residents to cling to treetops as waters rose. Rescue efforts are underway with teams arriving from Brazil, South Africa, and the United Kingdom to assist local authorities. The scale of the floods raises urgent humanitarian concerns about displacement, safety, and long-term recovery in the region.</p>
<h2>Detainment of Suspected Russian Tanker Captain</h2>
<p>Authorities in France have taken into custody the captain of the Grinch, a suspected Russian shadow tanker seized in the Mediterranean Sea. The seizure occurred last Thursday as part of actions presumably related to international monitoring of maritime activities. The incident may have implications for shipping security and political relations in the region.</p>
<h2>Myanmar Election Controversy</h2>
<p>A recent election in Myanmar resulted in a party backed by the military generals poised for a landslide victory. However, the process was widely criticized as a sham, with many opposition parties banned and no voting taking place in about half of the country. This vote occurred amid ongoing civil war and widespread fear, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the electoral outcome and the country's political future.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In sports, Australian cyclist Jay Vine captured the Tour Down Under title despite a dramatic crash caused by a kangaroo on the course. Also, climber Alex Honnold achieved a remarkable feat by scaling a 101-floor Taiwanese skyscraper without any safety gear, marking a first for that building. In remembrance, Sir Mark Tully, a respected journalist known as the BBC’s "voice of India," passed away at age 90 after a storied career covering key moments in India’s history.</p>
