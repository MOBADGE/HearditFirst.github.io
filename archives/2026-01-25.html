    <h2>Minneapolis Shooting and Public Reaction</h2>
<p>Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse and avid outdoorsman who enjoyed mountain biking, was fatally shot in Minneapolis by federal agents. The incident has sparked protests near the scene, where demonstrators chanted Pretti’s name. Footage captured by bystanders shows the moments before the shooting, which authorities say was in self-defence. However, Pretti’s parents have strongly denied this account, calling the official explanations "sickening lies." Pretti is the second person to be shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis this month, raising concerns about law enforcement actions and accountability.</p>
<h2>Myanmar Election and Political Landscape</h2>
<p>An election recently held in Myanmar is expected to result in a landslide victory for the party backed by the military generals. However, the election process has been widely criticized. Many political parties were banned from participating, and there was no voting in roughly half of the country, which remains engulfed in fear and civil conflict. The lack of a genuinely competitive election and ongoing civil war contribute to concerns about Myanmar’s political future and the stability of its governance.</p>
<h2>Death of Sir Mark Tully</h2>
<p>Sir Mark Tully, known as the BBC’s “voice of India,” has died at the age of 90. He had a long and distinguished career covering some of the most significant events in India’s history. His work helped bring Indian affairs to an international audience and contributed to a better understanding of the country’s complexities over many decades.</p>
<h2>Notable Climbing Achievement</h2>
<p>Alex Honnold has made headlines by becoming the first person to climb a 101-floor skyscraper in Taiwan without using any safety gear or assistance. This feat adds to his reputation for challenging climbs done free solo. His achievement has drawn attention to the risks and skill associated with this kind of urban climbing.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Commentary</h2>
<p>A recent incident involving cosmetic doctor Zayn Khalid Majeed created controversy after he publicly criticized singer Troye Sivan’s appearance on TikTok. The singer responded critically to the doctor’s comments. Majeed has since expressed regret and said he aims to have a positive influence through his content, highlighting the ongoing debate about social media conduct and public discourse about personal appearance.</p>
<h2>Global Geopolitical Shifts</h2>
<p>Experts are observing a shift in the global order reminiscent of the pre-World War II era, posing challenges to “middle powers” — countries that are neither global superpowers nor small states. Economic stagnation, growing inequality, and declining trust in democratic institutions are contributing to a “rupture” with the post-WWII political and economic arrangements. Some see political figures like Donald Trump as symptoms of these deeper issues rather than causes, suggesting a period of significant geopolitical uncertainty ahead.</p>
