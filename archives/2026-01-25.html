    <h2>Tragic Death of Minneapolis Nurse Sparks Protests</h2>
<p>Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse and avid outdoorsman from Minneapolis, was fatally shot by federal agents this month. Officials claim the agents acted in self-defense, but Pretti’s family disputes this explanation, calling the accounts "sickening lies." Pretti is the second person to be killed by federal agents in the city recently, prompting protests at the shooting scene where demonstrators chanted his name. The incident has heightened tensions around law enforcement actions in Minneapolis.</p>
<h2>Myanmar Election Marked by Restrictions and Violence</h2>
<p>Myanmar’s recent election, widely described as a "sham," ended with a party backed by the military poised for a landslide victory. The electoral process was heavily restricted: many political parties were banned, and no votes were cast in about half the country. This comes amid ongoing civil conflict and widespread fear. The election outcome is likely to deepen the country’s division and prolong instability.</p>
<h2>French Authorities Detain Russian Tanker Captain</h2>
<p>In the Mediterranean Sea, French officials seized a tanker named the Grinch, which is suspected of being linked to Russian shadow shipping activities. The captain was taken into custody. This seizure highlights ongoing international efforts to monitor and control covert maritime operations, particularly those connected to Russia amidst wider geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>Sir Mark Tully, Longtime BBC Correspondent on India, Passes Away</h2>
<p>Sir Mark Tully, a prominent BBC journalist who chronicled decades of Indian history, has died at the age of 90. Known as the "voice of India," Tully’s career spanned significant political and social changes on the subcontinent. His work offered many in the English-speaking world insight into India’s complexities and transformations.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Signals at India’s Republic Day Event</h2>
<p>India’s Republic Day celebrations are closely watched for their diplomatic symbolism, especially who is seated alongside the country’s president during the red carpet event. These seating arrangements reflect India’s foreign policy priorities and partnerships as the nation navigates its place on the global stage. This year's Republic Day continues that tradition, underscoring India’s evolving international relationships.</p>
<h2>Notable Climbing Feat in Taiwan</h2>
<p>Climber Alex Honnold has achieved a new milestone by scaling a 101-floor skyscraper in Taiwan without any safety equipment. He is reportedly the first person to climb this building alone and free of protective gear. This feat adds to Honnold’s reputation for high-risk climbing and draws attention to urban climbing challenges.</p>
