    <h2>Minneapolis Shooting Sparks Protests</h2>
<p>Federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, prompting protests near the scene. Officials from the Trump administration stated the shooting was in self-defense. However, Pretti’s parents strongly disputed this, accusing the agents of spreading "sickening lies." Bystander videos have surfaced showing moments just before the fatal incident, intensifying public scrutiny and debate over federal law enforcement practices in the city. Pretti is the second person shot by federal agents in Minneapolis this month, feeding tensions around police and federal authority.</p>
<h2>Myanmar Election Marked by Restrictions and Conflict</h2>
<p>Myanmar’s recent election, described as a "sham," ended with a party backed by the military generals poised for a landslide victory. Many political parties were banned from participating, and voting did not take place in about half the country. Myanmar remains gripped by fear and a continuing civil war, severely limiting free and fair political participation. The election results have been widely criticized both locally and internationally amid concerns for the country’s democracy and ongoing violence.</p>

The feat reflects Honnold’s reputation for free solo climbing, where protection gear is deliberately avoided. Such climbs are risky but draw attention for their audacity and physical skill, adding to Honnold’s record of groundbreaking ascents.</p>
<h2>Insights on U.S. Political Climate and Global Challenges</h2>
<p>The global order appears to be shifting back toward a pre-World War II style of geopolitics, marked by economic stagnation and deep inequalities. This environment has eroded trust in democratic institutions worldwide. Some analysts suggest that figures like former President Trump may be symptoms rather than causes of a broader "rupture" in the post-war international system. Amid this complex political landscape, "middle powers" face significant challenges in balancing economic and diplomatic pressures.</p>
<h2>India’s Republic Day Reflects Foreign Policy Priorities</h2>
