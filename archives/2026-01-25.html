    <h2>Federal Shooting in Minneapolis Sparks Protests</h2>
<p>Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old man, was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis earlier this month. Officials linked to former President Trump said the agents acted in self-defense during the incident. However, Pretti’s parents strongly dispute this claim, accusing authorities of spreading "sickening lies." Videos from bystanders capturing the moments leading up to the shooting have circulated, intensifying public scrutiny. Protests erupted near the scene, with demonstrators chanting Pretti’s name, reflecting growing tension around the use of force by federal agents in the city.</p>
<h2>Myanmar Election Raises Concerns</h2>
<p>The final round of voting has concluded in Myanmar’s national election amid widespread criticism. Observers describe the process as a "sham," with the party supported by the ruling military expected to claim a sweeping victory. The country remains engulfed in civil war and political strife, where fear grips much of the population. The election outcome is unlikely to bring stability, instead possibly deepening existing divides and prolonging conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Alex Honnold Climbs Taiwanese Skyscraper Without Safety Gear</h2>
<p>Renowned climber Alex Honnold has achieved a new feat by scaling a 101-floor skyscraper in Taiwan alone and without any safety equipment. This accomplishment adds to his reputation for bold, solo ascents requiring immense skill and courage. Honnold’s climb highlights his continued influence in the world of extreme sports and could inspire both admiration and debate over the risks involved in such feats.</p>
<h2>Death of Sir Mark Tully, BBC’s ‘Voice of India’</h2>
<p>Sir Mark Tully, a distinguished journalist known for his deep coverage of India over decades, has died at the age of 90. He earned the nickname “voice of India” through his insightful reporting on many defining moments in the country’s history. His work helped audiences worldwide better understand India’s complex social and political landscape.</p>
<h2>Global Context: Shifting World Order and Domestic Challenges</h2>
<p>As international relations increasingly reflect tensions reminiscent of the pre-World War II era, “middle powers” face significant challenges ahead. Economic stagnation and widening inequality have eroded trust in democratic institutions, contributing to political volatility. Commentators suggest that figures like Trump may be symptoms rather than causes of a broader “rupture” with the post-war global order. This evolving geopolitical landscape is prompting countries to reconsider alliances and strategies in coming years.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Diplomatic Signals at India’s Republic Day</h2>
<p>India’s Republic Day celebrations this year carried notable diplomatic messages, especially through the seating arrangements beside the country’s president. These choices are seen as reflections of New Delhi’s foreign policy priorities and international relationships. The event underscores India’s efforts to balance its regional and global interests amidst a complex geopolitical environment.</p>
