Pretti was known as an avid outdoorsman with a passion for mountain biking. Federal officials claim the shooting was in self-defense, while Pretti’s parents have strongly denied this, calling the official accounts "sickening lies."

<h2>Global Reflections: Challenges for Middle Powers in a Changing World Order</h2>
<p>Analysts are observing that the global political landscape is shifting toward a pre-World War II order, bringing challenges for "middle powers"—countries with notable but not dominant global influence.

These factors contribute to a "rupture" in the post-WWII international system, suggesting that political figures like Donald Trump may reflect deeper systemic changes rather than isolated causes.</p>
