    <h2>US Federal Agents’ Shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>This month, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse and US citizen, was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis. Government officials stated the shooting happened in self-defense. However, Pretti’s parents have strongly rejected this account, calling the agents’ statements “sickening lies.” Public anger has been evident as protests have taken place near the shooting scene, with demonstrators chanting Pretti’s name. This incident marks the second fatal shooting by federal agents in the city within the same month. Video footage capturing moments around the shooting has circulated, bringing renewed attention and calls for clarity about the circumstances of Pretti's death.</p>
<h2>Global Geopolitical Challenges and the Post-WW2 Order</h2>
<p>The post-World War II global order is facing significant pressures, according to recent analysis. Economic stagnation and rising inequality have eroded trust in democratic institutions worldwide. This environment has contributed to political ruptures, of which the rise of figures like Trump may be seen as symptoms rather than causes. These developments pose tough challenges for “middle powers”—countries that occupy an intermediate position in global politics—as they navigate shifting alliances and a less stable international landscape. Understanding these changes is key to anticipating future diplomatic and economic shifts.</p>
<h2>India’s Republic Day and Its Foreign Policy Signal</h2>
<p>India’s Republic Day celebrations carry more than ceremonial significance; the guests seated beside India’s president provide insight into the country's diplomatic priorities. These seating arrangements are closely watched as symbolic signals of which countries Delhi values most at the moment. Such events highlight India’s approach to strengthening relationships and balancing global partnerships. Tracking these diplomatic cues can help observers better understand India’s evolving foreign policy stance in an increasingly complex international environment.</p>
<h2>Remarkable Climb by Alex Honnold in Taiwan</h2>
<p>In a notable feat of urban climbing, Alex Honnold has become the first person to scale a 101-floor skyscraper in Taiwan without the use of safety gear. This solo ascent marks a significant achievement in the world of free climbing and has drawn attention for its combination of physical skill and daring. Honnold’s climb pushes the boundaries of what is possible in urban climbing and continues to inspire interest in extreme sports and adventure activities.</p>
<h2>Public Opinion on President Trump</h2>
<p>With the start of 2026 marked by pivotal events both in the United States and abroad, perceptions of President Trump remain a subject of analysis. BBC’s Ros Atkins has examined how Americans currently view their president amid ongoing political developments and challenges. Understanding public sentiment toward Trump is important as it reflects broader trends in national politics and can influence the direction of future policy decisions and electoral outcomes.</p>
