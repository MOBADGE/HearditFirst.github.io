<h2>US Military Action in Syria</h2>
<p>The United States carried out a large-scale strike against Islamic State (IS) targets across Syria.

This action underscores ongoing US efforts to counter IS activities in the Middle East and indicates continued military engagement there.</p>
<h2>Historic Spaceflight Milestone</h2>

<h2>High-Profile Prison Sentence in China</h2>
