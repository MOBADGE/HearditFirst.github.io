    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 05, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Energy and Trade Relations</h2>
<p>Russia has announced it is prepared to supply "uninterrupted" fuel to India, reflecting deepening ties between the two countries. This announcement coincides with the signing of agreements in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals during the Russian Prime Minister’s visit to India. These deals suggest a strategic partnership focused on energy security and resource development, which could have long-term economic and geopolitical implications for both nations.</p>
<h2>Military and Defence Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to reinstate its voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This move forms part of a broader effort to build what the country envisions as Europe’s strongest conventional army. Reintroducing voluntary service marks a significant policy shift for Germany and signals a renewed focus on boosting its military capabilities amid evolving regional security concerns.</p>
<h2>Environmental Concerns Over Deep-Sea Mining</h2>
<p>New scientific research has found that deep-sea mining tests negatively affect more than a third of seabed animal species. This finding intensifies the debate between proponents of green technology, who see mining as essential for metals used in renewable energy, and environmentalists concerned about the irreversible damage to marine ecosystems. The study highlights the environmental risks involved in extracting resources from the ocean floor.</p>
<h2>Technology and Entertainment Industry Moves</h2>
<p>Netflix has announced plans to acquire Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses for $72 billion. This major Hollywood deal will give Netflix ownership of notable franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The acquisition represents a significant consolidation in the streaming and entertainment sector, potentially altering the competitive landscape and content availability worldwide.</p>
<h2>Social and Political Issues in Various Regions</h2>
<p>In the Faroe Islands, politicians have voted to overturn one of Europe’s strictest abortion laws. The new decision removes restrictions that previously banned abortion in most cases, signaling a notable change in social policy within the self-governing Danish territory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong is experiencing public debate following the arrest of Miles Kwan, who was detained after launching a petition that demanded answers from local authorities about a fire incident. This incident has raised questions about civic participation and government accountability in the region.</p>
<h2>Economic Partnerships and Challenges</h2>
<p>Kenya has secured a landmark health funding agreement with the United States, becoming the first African country to receive such support since U.S. foreign aid cuts under the Trump administration. Despite concerns about data privacy, this funding could enhance Kenya’s healthcare resilience and partnerships with the U.S.</p>
<p>In India, travel disruptions are worsening as IndiGo, the country’s largest airline, cancels hundreds of flights. The airline has indicated that normal operations are not expected to resume until February 10, affecting millions of travelers during the peak holiday season.</p>
