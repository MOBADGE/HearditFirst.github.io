    <h2>International Energy and Trade</h2>
<p>Russia has expressed its readiness to supply uninterrupted fuel to India, coinciding with the recent visit of the Russian Prime Minister to the country. During the stay, deals were signed focused on civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. This development signals strengthening ties in energy and resource sectors between Russia and India, potentially impacting global energy markets and strategic alliances.</p>
<h2>Military Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to reinstate a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This decision is part of a broader effort aimed at building Europe's strongest conventional army. By reintroducing voluntary service, Germany seeks to enhance its defense capabilities amid changing security dynamics in the region, which could influence military policies and cooperation across Europe.</p>
<h2>Legal and Human Rights News from Eritrea</h2>
<p>Thirteen Eritreans, including former cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot who competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, have been released after spending 18 years in detention without trial. Their release from a notorious jail marks a notable development in Eritrea regarding long-standing human rights concerns. It remains to be seen how this will affect the broader political and humanitarian situation in the country.</p>
<h2>Major Media Merger</h2>
<p>Netflix is set to acquire Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses for $72 billion. This acquisition will transfer ownership of major franchises like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones to Netflix, significantly reshaping the entertainment industry. The deal highlights ongoing consolidation trends in media, which may affect content availability, competition, and consumer choice in streaming services.</p>
<h2>Peace Efforts and Investment in Africa</h2>
<p>A peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda has been hailed as historic by US President Donald Trump. He expressed hope that the accord will open the door for increased American investments in this resource-rich region. The deal could contribute to stability in Central Africa and foster economic development if sustained over time.</p>
<h2>Public Concern in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>An arrest related to a petition demanding answers from Hong Kong authorities about a fire incident has sparked public debate. Miles Kwan's detention after launching the petition raises questions about freedom of expression and civil society engagement in the city.
