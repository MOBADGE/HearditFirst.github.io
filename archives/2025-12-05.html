    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 05, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Energy and Trade Relations</h2>
<p>Russia has expressed its readiness to supply "uninterrupted" fuel to India, highlighting a growing energy partnership between the two nations. This announcement came during the Russian Prime Minister’s visit to India, where both countries signed deals in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals sectors. These agreements may enhance India's energy security and deepen economic ties with Russia amidst evolving global geopolitical landscapes.</p>
<h2>Military Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has decided to introduce a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This move is part of a broader push to strengthen Germany’s military capabilities and aims to contribute towards creating the strongest conventional army in Europe. The program reflects Germany's ongoing efforts to adapt its defense strategy in response to regional security challenges and shifting geopolitical priorities.</p>
<h2>Legal Challenge on Birthright Citizenship in the US</h2>
<p>The United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging birthright citizenship. This case involves a former executive order from Donald Trump that aimed to end birthright citizenship. Lower courts previously rejected this directive, but the Supreme Court’s decision to review the challenge signals potential changes in immigration policy and constitutional interpretation, which could have significant implications for citizenship laws in the US.</p>
<h2>Significant Releases in Eritrea</h2>
<p>Thirteen individuals, including former Olympic cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot who competed in the 1980 Moscow Games, have been released from a notorious prison in Eritrea after spending 18 years without trial. Relatives confirmed their freedom to the BBC. This development sheds light on issues of political detention and justice in Eritrea and may influence ongoing conversations about human rights in the region.</p>
<h2>Major Entertainment Industry Acquisition</h2>
<p>Netflix has announced plans to purchase Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses for $72 billion. This major deal will transfer ownership of popular franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones to Netflix, significantly expanding its content portfolio. The acquisition could reshape the competitive landscape of the global entertainment industry as streaming services continue to consolidate and diversify offerings.</p>
<h2>Wildlife Conservation and Legal Decisions</h2>
<p>Namibia has lost its bid to overturn an international ban on the trade of rhino horn. The country has accumulated large stockpiles of rhino horn after implementing a strategy of dehorning rhinos to deter poaching. The ruling maintains existing global efforts to curb the illegal wildlife trade, underscoring the complex balance between conservation practices and local economic interests.</p>
<h2>Additional News Briefs</h2>
<p>- India is facing worsening travel disruptions as IndiGo, the country's largest airline, cancels hundreds of flights. The carrier anticipates full restoration of operations by 10 February, indicating prolonged logistical challenges for travelers.</p>
<p>- A woman named Yangchen Lachungpa, wanted by Interpol for trafficking tiger parts, was arrested in India. She is accused of establishing trafficking corridors that facilitate illegal wildlife trade from the country.</p>
<p>- Police in New Zealand recovered a $19,000 Fabergé egg that was swallowed by a man suspected of attempting to steal the diamond-studded object, which is linked to the James Bond film "Octopussy."</p>
<p>- Donald Trump welcomed a newly signed peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. He expressed hope that the deal will encourage increased American investment in the mineral-rich region, potentially contributing to stability and economic growth.</p>
