    <h2>International Energy and Trade Relations</h2>
<p>Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced that Russia is ready to provide "uninterrupted" fuel supplies to India. During his visit, the two countries signed agreements covering civil nuclear energy cooperation and critical minerals. This development highlights growing strategic and economic ties between Russia and India, potentially stabilizing fuel supplies and supporting India's energy needs.</p>
<h2>Military and Defense Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to introduce a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This change comes as part of an effort to build what is described as Europe's strongest conventional army. The move marks a shift in Germany’s military policy, signaling increased focus on national defense amid evolving security challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Justice in Eritrea and Tanzania</h2>
<p>Thirteen Eritreans, including former Olympian cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot who competed in the 1980 Moscow Games, have been released after spending 18 years in prison without trial. Their release from a notorious jail represents a significant humanitarian moment for the country.</p>
<p>In Tanzania, seventeen Western embassies have called on the government to release the bodies of victims from post-election violence. There is documented evidence of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and concealment of bodies. The international pressure highlights concerns about human rights and accountability following recent political unrest.</p>
<h2>Major Media Merger in the Entertainment Industry</h2>
<p>Netflix announced a $72 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses. This acquisition will give Netflix control over major franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The move represents a significant consolidation in the entertainment sector, likely affecting content availability and competition in streaming services.</p>
<h2>Regional Peace and Public Safety Issues</h2>
<p>A peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda was praised by U.S. President Donald Trump, who sees it as a step toward increased American investment in the region’s resource-rich areas. The agreement may improve stability and economic prospects in Central Africa.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, an arrest has sparked public debate after Miles Kwan was detained for launching a petition demanding answers about a recent fire. The incident raises questions about public accountability and freedom of expression in the territory.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Travel Challenges</h2>
<p>Namibia’s recent attempt to overturn the ban on rhino horn trade failed. The country has accumulated large stocks of rhino horn after removing horns from rhinos to deter poachers, but the continuation of the ban affects its conservation and trade policies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, travel chaos is worsening in India following the cancellation of hundreds of flights by IndiGo, the country’s largest airline. The company expects normal operations to resume only by February 10, indicating ongoing disruptions for travelers.</p>
