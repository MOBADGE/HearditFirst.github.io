    <h2>International Energy and Trade Relations</h2>
<p>Russia has announced its readiness to provide India with an uninterrupted fuel supply as part of expanding cooperation between the two countries. This commitment comes alongside recent deals signed during the Russian prime minister’s visit to India, focusing on civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. These agreements highlight ongoing efforts to strengthen bilateral ties in key sectors, which could boost energy security and strategic collaboration for both nations.</p>
<h2>Military Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to introduce a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds, signaling a shift in its defense strategy. This move supports the country’s ambitions to develop what it calls Europe’s strongest conventional army. The new program aims to increase recruitment and enhance military readiness, reflecting broader concerns about regional security and defense capabilities in Europe.</p>
<h2>Justice and Human Rights in Eritrea</h2>
<p>Thirteen individuals, including former cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot who competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, have been released after spending 18 years in detention without trial in Eritrea. The detainees were held in a notorious prison, and their release was confirmed by relatives. This development could mark a small step toward addressing long-standing issues related to detention practices and human rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Major Media Industry Deal</h2>
<p>Netflix is set to acquire Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses for $72 billion. This significant transaction will give Netflix ownership over major franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The deal represents a major consolidation in the entertainment industry and may reshape the landscape for film and streaming content providers going forward.</p>
<h2>Peace and Political Developments in Africa</h2>
<p>A peace agreement has been reached between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, a development hailed as historic by the US president. The deal offers hope for increased stability in the resource-rich region and is expected to pave the way for greater American investment. This could have positive implications for regional security and economic growth, though the longer-term success of the agreement remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Public and Legal Issues in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, the arrest of Miles Kwan, who launched a petition demanding answers from authorities about a recent fire, has sparked public debate. The detention highlights ongoing tensions concerning civic activism and the government’s response to public inquiries. The case is closely watched for what it may indicate about the limits of petitioning and public expression in the city.</p>
