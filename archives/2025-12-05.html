    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 05, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Energy and Trade</h2>
<p>Russian Prime Minister's visit to India resulted in new agreements on civil nuclear energy and critical minerals, enhancing cooperation between the two countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia is ready to supply "uninterrupted" fuel to India, signaling strengthened ties in energy supply. This could support India's growing energy needs and deepen economic relations between the nations.</p>
<h2>Military Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to introduce a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This marks a significant change in its defense policy amidst efforts to build what it aims to be Europe's strongest conventional army. The program may lead to a more prepared and capable military force and reflects shifting priorities in European security.</p>
<h2>US Supreme Court and Birthright Citizenship</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging birthright citizenship. This comes after lower courts rejected former US President Donald Trump's executive order attempting to end this right. The case could have broad implications on US immigration policy and the legal framework defining citizenship for children born in the US.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Human Rights News</h2>
<p>Eritrean ex-cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot, who competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, has been released from jail after 18 years without trial, along with 12 others. This development brings attention to long-standing human rights concerns in Eritrea. The release may influence ongoing discussions about justice and political freedoms in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in India, authorities have arrested Yangchen Lachungpa, a woman wanted by Interpol for trafficking tiger parts. Lachungpa is accused of establishing trafficking routes out of India, highlighting global efforts to curb illegal wildlife trade.</p>
<h2>Business and Media</h2>
<p>Netflix announced it will acquire Warner Bros' film and streaming businesses for $72 billion. This major deal transfers ownership of major franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones to Netflix. The acquisition signals significant consolidation in the entertainment industry and could reshape media content distribution and production.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Wildlife Issues</h2>
<p>Namibia has lost its legal bid to overturn an international ban on the trade of rhino horn. The country has amassed large stockpiles of rhino horn as part of its anti-poaching efforts, which includes cutting off horns to deter poachers. This ruling maintains international restrictions on the trade, reflecting ongoing tensions between conservation policies and the interests of some countries in managing endangered species.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>India is experiencing worsening travel disruptions as IndiGo, its largest airline, canceled hundreds of flights.</p>
<p>The carrier expects normal operations to resume only by 10 February, affecting many travelers and highlighting challenges in India's aviation sector.</p>
<p>In global peace efforts, there is a positive development as a peace deal was signed between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.</p>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump described the agreement as "historic" and hopes it will lead to increased American investment in the resource-rich region, which could contribute to regional stability and economic growth.</p>
<p>Finally, legendary architect Frank Gehry, known for his innovative metallic building designs, died at the age of 96.</p>
<p>Gehry's work has left a lasting impact on contemporary architecture worldwide.</p>
