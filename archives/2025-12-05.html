    <h2>International Energy and Trade Relations</h2>
<p>Russian officials say they are ready to provide uninterrupted fuel supplies to India. During the Russian Prime Minister’s visit to India, both countries signed agreements on civil nuclear energy cooperation and critical minerals trade. This move aims to strengthen energy ties and support India’s growing demand for reliable fuel sources. It reflects continuing efforts by Russia to deepen economic connections with key partners in Asia.</p>
<h2>Military Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to introduce a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This decision marks a shift in Germany’s defense policy, aligning with its recent ambition to build Europe’s strongest conventional army. The program is expected to increase recruitment and improve readiness amid evolving security challenges on the continent.</p>
<h2>Major Media Acquisition</h2>
<p>Netflix announced it will purchase Warner Bros film and streaming businesses in a deal valued at $72 billion. This acquisition will give Netflix control over well-known movie and TV franchises, including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The deal expands Netflix’s content library significantly, positioning the streaming company to compete more aggressively in the global entertainment market.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Developments in Africa</h2>
<p>A peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda was welcomed by US President Donald Trump. He described the deal as "historic" and expressed hope it could lead to increased American investment in the resource-rich region. The agreement seeks to ease longstanding tensions and promote stability in central Africa.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Thirteen Eritreans, including former Olympian cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot, were released after spending 18 years without trial in a notorious prison. Families say the long detention without charge has ended, raising hopes for justice and improved human rights conditions in Eritrea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 17 Western embassies urged Tanzania to release the bodies of people believed to have been victims of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances following recent elections. The call highlights ongoing concerns about human rights abuses and government transparency in Tanzania.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In India, travel disruptions worsened as the country’s largest airline, IndiGo, canceled hundreds of flights. The carrier expects normal operations to resume by early February, affecting thousands of travelers during a key holiday period.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, public debate has intensified after Miles Kwan was arrested for launching a petition demanding answers about a recent fire. The detention has sparked discussions on civic engagement and government accountability.</p>
<p>Namibia lost its legal bid to overturn a ban on rhino horn trade, despite having large stockpiles obtained through practices aimed at deterring poaching.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, police recovered a $19,000 Fabergé egg after a man allegedly swallowed it during a theft attempt. The diamond-studded egg is named after the James Bond film "Octopussy," adding an unusual twist to the case.</p>
