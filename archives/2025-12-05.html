    <h2>International Energy and Trade</h2>
<p>Russia has committed to supplying "uninterrupted" fuel to India, according to Russian leadership. This pledge comes alongside new agreements signed during the Russian Prime Minister's visit to India in areas including civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. These developments signify strengthened economic and energy ties between the two countries, which could impact global energy markets and cooperation in strategic sectors moving forward.</p>
<h2>Military and Security Developments</h2>
<p>Germany is shifting its military policy by introducing a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This change supports ongoing efforts to build Europe's strongest conventional army, reflecting broader security concerns and the desire for greater defense capabilities within the region.</p>
<p>In India, authorities arrested Yangchen Lachungpa, wanted by Interpol for trafficking tiger parts. Lachungpa is accused of establishing smuggling operations extending beyond national borders, highlighting ongoing challenges in wildlife protection and international crime prevention.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political News</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging birthright citizenship after lower courts rejected a related executive order by Donald Trump. The ruling will address key questions about citizenship rights in the United States, with potentially far-reaching consequences for immigration policy.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the recent arrest of Miles Kwan has sparked public debate. Kwan was detained after initiating a petition seeking answers from local authorities, signifying continuing tensions around civic expression and governmental accountability in the city.</p>
<h2>Environment and Conservation</h2>
<p>Namibia has lost its legal bid to overturn an international ban on the trade of rhino horn. The country had accumulated significant stockpiles following its unique approach of cutting rhino horns to deter poachers. The ruling maintains current global protections for rhinos amidst ongoing efforts to balance conservation and regional economic interests.</p>
<h2>Business and Economy</h2>
<p>Netflix has announced its plan to acquire Warner Bros' film and streaming businesses for $72 billion. This major Hollywood transaction will bring popular franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones under Netflix's ownership, potentially reshaping the entertainment industry and streaming competition worldwide.</p>
<h2>Regional Peace and Travel</h2>
<p>A historic peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda has been hailed by US President Donald Trump. He expressed hope that the agreement would open the door for increased American investment in the resource-rich region, signaling potential economic and political stability improvements.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India is experiencing worsening travel disruptions as IndiGo, the country's largest airline, cancels hundreds of flights. The carrier expects operations to return to normal only by mid-February, affecting many travelers and raising concerns about the airline industry's recovery and infrastructure challenges.</p>
