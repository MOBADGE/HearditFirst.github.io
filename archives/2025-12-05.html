    <h2>International Energy and Resource Deals</h2>
<p>Russian Prime Minister during his visit to India announced that Russia is prepared to supply India with "uninterrupted" fuel. This comes alongside newly signed agreements in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. These deals are significant as they strengthen the energy partnership between the two countries and may bolster India's energy security and industrial growth.</p>
<h2>Military Policy in Germany</h2>
<p>Germany voted to introduce a voluntary military service program targeting 18-year-olds. This policy change is part of a broader effort to build what Germany hopes will become Europe’s strongest conventional army. The measure marks a shift in the country’s military strategy and could influence its role in European and global security affairs in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Notable Releases in Eritrea</h2>
<p>Thirteen detainees, including former cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot who competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, were released from a notorious Eritrean prison after 18 years without trial. The release was confirmed by relatives. This development may have implications for human rights discussions and international attention on Eritrea’s justice system.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Industry Merger</h2>
<p>Netflix reached an agreement to purchase Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses for $72 billion. With this acquisition, Netflix will take ownership of major franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The deal signals continued consolidation in the entertainment sector and could impact content availability and competition among streaming platforms.</p>
<h2>Peace Deal in Central Africa</h2>
<p>A peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda was described as "historic" by the US president. The deal is seen as a hopeful step toward stabilizing the resource-rich region. The US hopes this peace will facilitate greater American investments there, potentially encouraging economic development and regional security.</p>
<h2>Additional International and Regional Developments</h2>
<p>In Namibia, a legal effort to overturn the ban on rhino horn trade was unsuccessful, despite the country having large stockpiles from efforts to deter poaching. In Tanzania, 17 Western embassies pressed for the release of bodies of victims who died post-election, citing concerns of extrajudicial killings and disappearances. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, a public debate was sparked after the arrest of Miles Kwan for launching a petition demanding answers about a fire incident.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, authorities recovered a $19,000 diamond-studded Fabergé egg that a man allegedly swallowed after trying to steal it. Also, India’s largest airline, IndiGo, has canceled hundreds of flights amid ongoing travel disruptions, with the airline projecting a return to normal operations by 10 February.</p>
