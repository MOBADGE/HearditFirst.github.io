    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 05, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Energy and Trade</h2>
<p>Russian Prime Minister announced that Russia is prepared to provide "uninterrupted" fuel supplies to India. During his visit, both countries signed agreements on civil nuclear energy and critical minerals, deepening their energy and resource ties. This ongoing cooperation highlights Russia's role as a key supplier for India's growing energy demands and may influence regional trade and diplomacy.</p>
<h2>Military and Defense Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to introduce a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This decision aligns with efforts to build Europe’s strongest conventional army amid changing security dynamics on the continent. The new program could bolster Germany’s defense capabilities by engaging younger citizens in national service while addressing broader regional security concerns.</p>
<h2>Legal Challenge on Birthright Citizenship in the US</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that challenges birthright citizenship. This follows an executive order by President Donald Trump that sought to end automatic citizenship for children born in the US, a move previously blocked by lower courts. The court's decision to take up the case could potentially reshape an important constitutional principle and affect immigration policies going forward.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Human Rights News</h2>
<p>Thirteen Eritreans, including former Olympic cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot who competed at the 1980 Moscow Games, have been released after 18 years without trial from a notorious prison in Eritrea. Their release raises awareness of long-standing human rights issues in the country and offers a rare positive development for imprisoned political detainees and athletes.</p>
<h2>Business and Entertainment Industry</h2>
<p>Netflix announced it will acquire Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses for $72 billion. This deal grants Netflix ownership of major franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, significantly expanding the streaming giant’s content library. The acquisition marks a major shift in Hollywood’s landscape and could impact global entertainment markets and consumer options.</p>
<h2>Travel Disruptions in India</h2>
<p>India is experiencing worsening travel disruptions as IndiGo, the country's largest airline, has canceled hundreds of flights. The company has warned that operations are unlikely to return to full normalcy until 10 February. This ongoing disruption could affect millions of travelers during a peak travel period and highlights issues within India’s aviation sector.</p>
