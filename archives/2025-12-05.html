    <div class="date">December 05, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Energy and Trade</h2>
<p>Russia has announced its readiness to supply uninterrupted fuel to India, strengthening ties between the two countries. This pledge comes alongside newly signed agreements in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals during the Russian Prime Minister's visit to India. The deals highlight ongoing cooperation in strategic sectors and may enhance energy security and industrial development in India.</p>
<h2>Military and Security Developments</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to reintroduce voluntary military service for 18-year-olds, marking a significant policy change aimed at bolstering Europe's conventional military strength. This move reflects Germany's efforts to contribute to building a robust defense capability within Europe amid evolving security challenges.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Justice</h2>
<p>Thirteen Eritreans, including former Olympian cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot who competed in the 1980 Moscow Games, have been released after spending 18 years in prison without trial. Their release from a notorious detention facility signals a rare instance of justice and may prompt attention to ongoing human rights issues within Eritrea.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Industry Shift</h2>
<p>Netflix is set to acquire Warner Bros' film and streaming businesses for $72 billion, gaining ownership of major franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. This significant acquisition will expand Netflix's content portfolio and could reshape the competitive landscape of Hollywood's entertainment industry.</p>
<h2>Regional Peace and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>A peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda has been hailed as "historic" by the US president. The agreement is seen as a step toward stabilizing the region, which is rich in natural resources, and could open opportunities for increased American investment and development.</p>
<h2>Social and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, an arrest has sparked public debate after Miles Kwan was detained for launching a petition demanding answers from authorities regarding a fire incident. The situation reflects ongoing tensions and calls for government accountability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Western countries are urging Tanzania to release the bodies of victims who died following recent elections amid reports of extrajudicial killings and disappearances. Seventeen embassies have expressed concern over these alleged human rights violations, emphasizing the need for transparency and justice.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous News</h2>
<p>In New Zealand, police recovered a $19,000 Fabergé egg after a man allegedly swallowed it following an attempted theft. The diamond-studded egg is notable for its connection to the James Bond film Octopussy.</p>
<p>In Namibia, a bid to overturn the ban on rhino horn trade was unsuccessful. The country has accumulated large stockpiles of rhino horn after pioneering efforts to protect rhinos by dehorning them to deter poachers, highlighting ongoing challenges in wildlife conservation.</p>
<h2>Travel Disruptions</h2>
<p>India faces worsening travel chaos as IndiGo, the country’s largest airline, canceled hundreds of flights. The carrier has indicated that normal operations are expected to resume only by February 10, potentially impacting millions of travelers during the busy season.</p>
