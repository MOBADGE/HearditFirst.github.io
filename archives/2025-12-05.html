    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 05, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Energy and Trade Relations</h2>
<p>Russia has expressed its readiness to supply continuous fuel to India, underlining the growing energy partnership between the two countries. During a recent visit by the Russian Prime Minister to India, agreements were signed in the sectors of civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. This move highlights Russia's commitment to strengthening energy cooperation with India, ensuring a steady supply of critical resources that could support India’s expanding energy needs in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Military Developments in Europe</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to introduce a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds, reflecting a broader initiative to enhance its defense capabilities. This decision aligns with Germany's goal to develop one of Europe's strongest conventional armies amid evolving security concerns across the continent. The program is expected to encourage more youth participation in national defense, potentially reshaping Germany's military structure and readiness.</p>
<h2>Judicial Proceedings on US Citizenship Policy</h2>
<p>The United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging birthright citizenship. This case arises from President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, which had previously been rejected by lower courts. The Supreme Court’s involvement could have significant implications for how citizenship is determined in the US, a foundational issue tied to immigration policy and constitutional interpretation.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Environmental News</h2>
<p>In Eritrea, 13 individuals, including former cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot, who competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, have been released after spending 18 years in prison without trial. This development has been confirmed by relatives and sheds light on ongoing human rights concerns in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Namibia has faced a setback after losing its bid to overturn an international ban on the rhino horn trade. The country had pioneered the practice of cutting off rhino horns to deter poachers and has built large stockpiles of horns, hoping to use them within regulated trade frameworks. The ruling maintains the ban, impacting Namibia’s conservation and economic strategies related to wildlife.</p>
<h2>Business and Legal Highlights</h2>
<p>Netflix has announced a $72 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses. This acquisition gives Netflix control over well-known franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, marking a significant shift in the entertainment industry's landscape by combining major content libraries under one streaming service.</p>
<p>In India, airline IndiGo has cancelled hundreds of flights, worsening travel chaos in the country. The carrier, which is India’s largest, has indicated that normal operations are expected to resume only by 10 February, indicating prolonged disruptions for travelers.</p>
<p>On a different note, Indian police have arrested Yangchen Lachungpa, wanted by Interpol over the trafficking of tiger parts. She is alleged to have established trafficking corridors out of the country, highlighting ongoing efforts to combat illegal wildlife trade.</p>
<h2>Regional Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>A peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda has been hailed by former US President Donald Trump as "historic." The agreement is seen as a potential foundation for increased American investment in this resource-rich region, with hopes that improved stability will foster economic growth and cooperation in the future.</p>
