    <h2>International Energy Cooperation</h2>
<p>Russia has signaled its readiness to provide India with uninterrupted fuel supplies. This announcement came amid the Russian Prime Minister's visit to India, where both countries signed deals focused on civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. These agreements underscore a growing energy partnership, which could enhance India's energy security and deepen economic ties between the two nations.</p>
<h2>Military and Defense Developments in Germany</h2>
<p>Germany has voted to introduce a voluntary military service program for 18-year-olds. This decision reflects a strategic shift aimed at strengthening the country's armed forces as part of broader efforts to establish Europe's most robust conventional military. The program is expected to contribute to Germany’s defense capabilities and its role within the European security framework.</p>
<h2>U.S. Supreme Court to Review Birthright Citizenship Case</h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship. This follows previous rejections by lower courts of an executive order issued by Donald Trump that sought to end automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to non-citizen parents. The case has significant implications for immigration policy and constitutional law.</p>
<h2>Major Media Merger: Netflix Acquires Warner Bros</h2>
<p>Netflix announced a $72 billion deal to purchase Warner Bros’ film and streaming businesses. This acquisition will bring popular franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones under Netflix’s ownership.

<h2>Namibia’s Rhino Horn Trade Ban Upheld</h2>
<p>Namibia has lost a legal bid to overturn the international ban on the trade of rhino horns. The country had developed a program of dehorning rhinos to prevent poaching while stockpiling horns. The rejection maintains current protections for rhinos and reflects ongoing global efforts to combat wildlife trafficking and protect endangered species.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>- Thirteen Eritrean detainees, including former Olympic cyclist Zeragaber Gebrehiwot, have been released after spending 18 years without trial in a notorious prison. Their release signals possible changes in Eritrea’s detention policies.</p>
<p>- India is facing worsening travel disruptions as IndiGo, the country’s largest airline, cancels hundreds of flights. Normal operations are not expected to resume until February 10, causing significant inconvenience for travelers.</p>

<p>- A rare Fabergé egg valued at $19,000 was recovered by police in New Zealand after a suspect reportedly swallowed it in an attempted theft. The diamond-studded egg is named after the James Bond film "Octopussy."</p>
<p>- Donald Trump celebrated a new peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. He expressed optimism that the deal will open pathways for increased American investment in the region, which is known for its rich natural resources.</p>
