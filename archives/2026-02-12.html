    <h2>Environment and Regulation</h2>
<p>The White House has revoked a landmark ruling that previously identified greenhouse gases as a danger to public health. This action has been described by the administration as the largest deregulation effort in the history of the United States. However, environmental groups warn that the rollback could have costly consequences for American communities and the environment. The change marks a significant shift in federal climate policy, with potential implications for future regulations aimed at reducing pollution.</p>
<h2>Immigration Enforcement in Minnesota</h2>
<p>"Operation Metro Surge," a recent immigration enforcement campaign in Minneapolis, is coming to an end according to the official overseeing the effort. The crackdown gained attention after two US citizens were killed in the city during its course. The conclusion of this operation may lead to a reassessment of immigration enforcement approaches in Minnesota, especially concerning community safety and civil rights.</p>
<h2>North Korean Succession Developments</h2>
<p>South Korea's intelligence service reports that Kim Jong Un has selected his teenage daughter, Ki Ju Ae, as his heir. Her increased public appearances have been interpreted as a sign of her rising prominence within North Korea’s leadership. This development could signal a historic succession plan in the authoritarian regime, sparking regional and international interest in the country's future political direction.</p>
<h2>International Legal News</h2>
<p>In Norway, a former prime minister has been charged with gross corruption linked to his connections with Jeffrey Epstein. The case followed the lifting of his immunity, which he held from his time serving as the Council of Europe's secretary general. The charges highlight ongoing legal scrutiny of individuals connected to Epstein and may have implications for efforts to address corruption and accountability in European institutions.</p>
<h2>Disaster in Madagascar</h2>
<p>The port city of Toamasina in Madagascar has been left in ruins after a powerful storm swept through the area, with the disaster now moving toward Mozambique. More than half of the city’s population has been affected, and much of its infrastructure has been destroyed. Relief and recovery efforts will be critical in the coming days as the region copes with the widespread damage and humanitarian needs.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>In the United States, a judge blocked the military’s attempt to demote Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain, over a video in which he told servicemembers they are not obliged to follow illegal orders.</p>
<p>This ruling could influence military discipline and legal standards around service member conduct.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Canada, investigations continue into a recent mass shooting.</p>
<p>Reports indicate the suspect had prior police visits related to mental health and that his firearms licence had expired two years ago.</p>
<p>Ownership of the firearms used in the attack remains unclear, as authorities seek to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, polling has closed in the country's first election since youth-led protests resulted in political change.</p>
<p>Voters are expressing hopes for a return to democracy following 15 years of authoritarian rule under Sheikh Hasina, marking a potentially significant shift in the nation’s governance.</p>
