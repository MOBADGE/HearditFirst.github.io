    <h2>Environmental Policy Changes in the US</h2>
<p>The White House announced the revocation of a key rule that recognized greenhouse gases as a threat to public health. This move represents what officials describe as the largest deregulatory action in US history. However, environmental groups warn that it may have significant negative effects on Americans’ health and the environment. The decision could alter how climate-related regulations are implemented in the coming years, potentially influencing the nation's approach to addressing climate change.</p>
<h2>Immigration Enforcement and Public Safety in Minnesota</h2>
<p>The US immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis known as "Operation Metro Surge" is coming to an end, according to the official overseeing the effort. During the crackdown, two US citizens were killed. The conclusion of this operation raises questions about its impact on safety and immigration enforcement policy in the region moving forward and how authorities will balance law enforcement with community trust.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in North Korea</h2>
<p>South Korea’s spy agency reports that Kim Jong Un is positioning his teenage daughter, Ki Ju Ae, as his heir. She has recently appeared prominently in public events, signaling a possible succession plan. This development is notable given the traditionally secretive nature of North Korea's leadership transitions and could have implications for the country's future governance and regional stability.</p>
<h2>Corruption Charges in Norway</h2>
<p>Norway’s former prime minister has been charged with gross corruption related to connections with Jeffrey Epstein. This legal action followed the removal of his immunity granted by the Council of Europe, where he previously served as secretary general. The case highlights ongoing scrutiny of high-profile figures linked to Epstein and raises questions about accountability among political elites in Europe.</p>
<h2>Tragic Mass Shooting in Canada</h2>
<p>Authorities are investigating a mass shooting in Canada involving a suspect who experienced mental health challenges and who had prior police contact. It remains unclear who legally owned the firearms used, as the suspect’s firearms licence expired two years ago. This incident adds to ongoing concerns about gun control and mental health support in preventing such tragedies.</p>
<h2>Storm Devastates Madagascar’s Main Port City</h2>
<p>A severe storm has caused widespread destruction in Toamasina, the main port city of Madagascar. More than half of the population is affected, with much of the infrastructure destroyed. The storm is now moving towards Mozambique, suggesting potential further impacts in the region. Recovery efforts and aid will be critical in the coming days to support the affected communities and restore vital services.</p>
