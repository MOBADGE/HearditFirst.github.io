    <h2>Mass Shooting in Tumbler Ridge, Canada</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting occurred at a school in Tumbler Ridge, a rural community in western Canada, where six people were killed and at least 25 others injured. Additionally, two people were found dead at a nearby home connected to the incident. Police have identified an 18-year-old suspect in relation to the shootings. This event is still developing, and authorities continue to investigate the circumstances. The loss of life and injuries have deeply affected the community as it copes with this violence.</p>
<h2>Political Moves in the United States</h2>
<p>The US House of Representatives voted to overturn tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on Canada last year. This resolution saw bipartisan support, including backing from six Republican lawmakers alongside Democrats. The move aims to ease trade tensions with Canada and could influence future economic relations between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Developments in China’s Military Leadership</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a rare public reference to a recent military purge involving Zhang Youxia, who is considered Xi’s closest ally within the military ranks. Zhang was removed from his post in January as part of this purge. This development highlights ongoing changes within China’s military leadership, though further details about the implications remain limited.</p>
<h2>Russia’s Crackdown on Messaging Apps</h2>
<p>Russia is taking steps to block WhatsApp, a widely used messaging app with 90 million users in the country. WhatsApp has stated that the move appears intended to push users toward a state-owned messaging app, which raises concerns about increased government surveillance. This action is part of a broader government crackdown on independent communication platforms.</p>
<h2>Airspace Closure in El Paso</h2>
<p>El Paso’s airspace was abruptly closed for 10 days, causing significant disruption. The closure reportedly followed a dispute related to drone technology testing conducted by the US military. The impact on travel and logistics has caused confusion and delays, though further information about the resolution or ongoing tensions has not yet been disclosed.</p>
<h2>Cultural Note: Tribute to James Van Der Beek and Bud Cort’s Passing</h2>
<p>Actors from the TV show "Dawson’s Creek" have led public tributes to James Van Der Beek, with one co-star urging support for his family through an online fundraiser. Separately, Bud Cort, known for his role in the cult classic film "Harold and Maude," has died at age 77. Cort’s career spanned more than 80 films and television series, marking a significant presence in stage and screen entertainment.</p>
