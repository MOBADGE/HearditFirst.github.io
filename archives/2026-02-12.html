    <h2>Tragedy in British Columbia</h2>
<p>A shooting in the remote town of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, has left six people dead and dozens more injured. Authorities identified the suspect as an 18-year-old. The community held a candlelit vigil on Wednesday night to mourn the victims. The incident has deeply affected the small town, highlighting concerns about safety in rural areas.</p>
<h2>Changes in North Korean Succession</h2>
<p>South Korea’s intelligence agency reported that Kim Jong Un has chosen his teenage daughter, Ki Ju Ae, as his heir. Her increased public appearances are seen as an indication of this decision. This is an unusual move that could signal changes in North Korea’s leadership dynamics, though details remain scarce given the secretive nature of the regime.</p>
<h2>Bangladesh Election Amid Calls for Democracy</h2>
<p>Bangladesh held its first election since large-scale protests led to the ousting of the previous leader. Voters are hopeful for a return to democratic governance after 15 years under the rule of Sheikh Hasina. The election is seen as a critical test of the country’s political future and stability, with citizens eager for political change.</p>
<h2>Restrictions on WhatsApp in Russia</h2>
<p>The Russian government has ordered a ban on the popular messaging app WhatsApp. The move is part of a broader crackdown on messaging platforms and is expected to push WhatsApp’s 90 million Russian users towards state-controlled communication tools. This development raises concerns about privacy and surveillance in Russia.</p>
<h2>US Lawmakers Move to Lift Canada Tariffs</h2>
<p>The US House of Representatives voted in favor of overturning tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on Canada last year. The resolution gained bipartisan support, with six Republicans joining Democrats. Removing these tariffs could improve trade relations between the two countries and ease tensions in North American economic ties.</p>
<h2>Cultural Farewell to Bud Cort</h2>
<p>Actor Bud Cort, known for his role in the cult classic film *Harold and Maude*, has died at the age of 77. Over his career, he appeared in more than 80 films and television series. Fans and colleagues remember him for his distinctive presence on stage and screen.</p>
