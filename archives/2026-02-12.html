    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 12, 2026</div>
    <h2>Environment and Climate Policy</h2>
<p>The White House has revoked a longstanding ruling that classified greenhouse gases as harmful to public health. This move marks what officials are calling the largest deregulation in U.S. history. Environmental experts, however, warn that rolling back this regulation could have costly consequences for Americans, potentially affecting efforts to address climate change and public health risks associated with pollution.</p>
<h2>Immigration Enforcement in Minnesota</h2>
<p>The intensified immigration enforcement effort known as "Operation Metro Surge" in Minneapolis appears to be ending. The crackdown had significant consequences, including the deaths of two U.S. citizens during the operation. This development may lead to a reassessment of immigration enforcement strategies amid concerns about community impact and public safety.</p>
<h2>Leadership Succession in North Korea</h2>
<p>South Korea's intelligence agency has reported that Kim Jong Un has chosen his teenage daughter, Ki Ju Ae, as his heir. Her increased visibility in public events is interpreted as a signal of her future leadership role. This unprecedented move could have implications for the future political landscape and stability in North Korea and the region.</p>
<h2>International Corruption Case</h2>
<p>Norway’s former prime minister has been charged with gross corruption linked to his connections with Jeffrey Epstein. The charges followed the lifting of his immunity by the Council of Europe, where he served as a former secretary general. The case highlights ongoing concerns about corruption and accountability among high-ranking officials.</p>
<h2>Natural Disaster in Madagascar</h2>
<p>A severe storm has devastated the port city of Toamasina in Madagascar, destroying most of the infrastructure and affecting over half the population. The storm is moving towards Mozambique, raising concerns about further damage in the region. Recovery efforts will be crucial in the coming weeks to support the affected communities.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments in the United States Military and Justice</h2>
<p>A judge has blocked an attempt by the U.S. military to demote retired Navy captain Mark Kelly. Kelly had encouraged servicemembers to refuse illegal orders, a stance that led Defence Secretary Hegseth to initiate rank reduction. The ruling underscores ongoing debates within the military about obedience, legality, and the rights of service members.</p>
<h2>Additional Headlines</h2>
<p>- In Canada, police are investigating a mass shooting suspect who had prior mental health interventions. Uncertainty remains about gun ownership, as the suspect’s firearms licence expired two years ago.
- The International Olympic Committee has defended its sale of a T-shirt designed in the style of the Nazi-era Olympics, describing it as part of its Heritage Collection.
- Bangladesh held elections following 15 years of authoritarian rule under Sheikh Hasina, with citizens hoping for a return to democracy.
- Tributes pour in for actor James Van Der Beek from former "Dawson's Creek" co-stars, including Katie Holmes, commemorating his bravery and kindness.</p>
