    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 12, 2026</div>
    <h2>Environment and Climate Policy</h2>
<p>The White House has revoked a landmark ruling that designated greenhouse gases as a threat to public health. This move has been described by the administration as the largest deregulation in US history. Environmental groups predict the decision could have costly consequences for Americans, suggesting potential negative impacts on climate change mitigation efforts and public health protections.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Affairs</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, "Operation Metro Surge," an immigration enforcement crackdown, is coming to an end. The operation saw increased law enforcement activities in the city but also resulted in the deaths of two US citizens. The conclusion of this enforcement surge raises questions about the future approach to immigration enforcement in urban areas and the balance between security and community relations.</p>
<h2>International Developments</h2>
<p>South Korea's intelligence agency has reported that Kim Jong Un has chosen his teenage daughter, Ki Ju Ae, as his heir. Her growing public profile is seen as a sign of her future leadership role, marking an unprecedented move in the country's leadership succession that may impact regional political dynamics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, satellite images indicate that Iran is reinforcing an underground complex near its nuclear facility. This build-up occurs amid ongoing high-stakes negotiations between Iranian and US officials regarding Iran's nuclear program, reflecting persistent tensions and uncertainty in diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political News</h2>
<p>Norway's former prime minister faces charges of gross corruption linked to his past role as secretary general of the Council of Europe. His immunity was lifted before the charges were brought, signaling a significant legal challenge with implications for political accountability in Europe.</p>
<p>In the US military, a judge has blocked the demotion of retired Navy captain Mark Kelly. The demotion was proposed after Kelly advised servicemembers that they are not required to obey illegal orders. The case highlights ongoing debates about military discipline and the rights of service personnel to question orders.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Social Issues</h2>
<p>Madagascar is recovering from a severe storm that devastated the port city of Toamasina, affecting more than half of the local population and destroying much of the infrastructure. The storm has also moved toward Mozambique, raising concerns about further regional disaster impacts and the need for humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>In Canada, a suspect involved in a recent mass shooting had prior police visits related to mental health concerns. Authorities noted that the suspect's firearms license had expired two years earlier, and questions remain about the ownership of the weapons used in the attack, pointing to ongoing challenges in gun control and mental health monitoring.</p>
