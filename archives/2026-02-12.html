    <h2>Major Shooting in British Columbia</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting in the small town of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, has left eight people dead and 25 injured. The violence occurred at a school and a home in this rural community. Authorities have identified an 18-year-old as the suspect. The remote town held a candlelit vigil to honor the victims. This incident has deeply affected the close-knit community and raises concerns about safety in rural areas.</p>
<h2>China’s Military Shake-Up Referenced by Xi Jinping</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made a rare public mention of a recent military purge. This follows the removal of Zhang Youxia, considered one of Xi’s closest military allies, from his post in January. This development highlights ongoing shifts within China’s military leadership, which could have implications for the country’s strategic direction and internal power dynamics.</p>
<h2>Russia Targets WhatsApp in Messaging Crackdown</h2>
<p>Russia has moved to block WhatsApp amid a wider crackdown on messaging apps. WhatsApp says this action is intended to push its approximately 90 million Russian users toward a "state-owned surveillance app." This escalation points to increasing government control over digital communication platforms in Russia, affecting user privacy and access to independent messaging services.</p>
<h2>US House Acts to End Tariffs on Canada</h2>
<p>The US House of Representatives voted in favor of overturning tariffs imposed on Canada by former US President Donald Trump last year. The resolution saw bipartisan support, with six Republicans joining Democrats. This move may help improve trade relations between the US and Canada and ease tensions created by the tariffs.</p>
<h2>Dutch Debate Over Four-Day Workweek Sustainability</h2>
<p>The Netherlands, known for having the lowest working hours in Europe, is grappling with whether the popular four-day workweek is sustainable for its economy. While many Dutch workers appreciate the shorter workweek, some argue it may be having negative effects on economic productivity. This ongoing discussion highlights challenges some countries face balancing work-life balance with economic growth.</p>
<h2>Election Focus in Bangladesh After Political Changes</h2>
<p>Bangladesh is preparing for a crucial election, the first since the 2024 Gen Z uprising that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina, the country’s long-serving prime minister. Voters are focusing on three key issues ahead of the vote, reflecting shifts in political sentiment and hopes for the future direction of the country.</p>
