    <h2>Climate Policy Rollback in the United States</h2>
<p>The White House has announced the revocation of a key ruling that classified greenhouse gases as a danger to public health, a landmark decision first made years ago. This move is described by the administration as the largest deregulation effort in US history. It reflects a decade-long effort by the president to dismantle climate policies, which he argues impede industrial growth. Environmental groups warn that this rollback could have costly consequences for Americans, particularly related to environmental and health impacts. The decision marks a significant shift in US climate policy and may affect future regulations and international climate commitments.</p>
<h2>Immigration Enforcement Changes in Minnesota</h2>
<p>The surge in immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, known as "Operation Metro Surge," is coming to an end, according to a US official involved in border policy. The crackdown in the Minneapolis area has been controversial, with two US citizens reportedly killed during the operation. The conclusion of this enforcement push may impact local immigration dynamics and community relations, though further details about the operation's overall effects are yet to emerge.</p>
<h2>Leadership Succession in North Korea</h2>
<p>South Korea’s intelligence agency reports that Kim Jong Un has chosen his teenage daughter, Ki Ju Ae, as his heir. Her increasing public appearances suggest she is being prepared for a prominent leadership role. This development is notable given the traditionally opaque nature of North Korean leadership succession and could influence the country's political future and regional stability.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions and Military Preparations in Iran</h2>
<p>Satellite images reveal that Iran is strengthening an underground complex near its nuclear site amid ongoing nuclear negotiations with US officials. This activity comes at a time of increased tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear program. The fortification could signal Iran’s intent to protect critical infrastructure and affects international diplomatic engagements on nuclear issues in the region.</p>
<h2>Severe Storm Damage in Madagascar</h2>
<p>A powerful storm has caused widespread devastation in Toamasina, Madagascar’s main port city. More than half the local population has been affected, and most of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed. The storm is now moving toward Mozambique, raising concerns about further damages and humanitarian needs in the region. Recovery efforts and aid will likely be critical in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Legal Decision on US Military Demotion Case</h2>
<p>A US judge has blocked the military from demoting Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain, following his public statement that service members are not required to obey illegal orders. The decision came after Defence Secretary Hegseth attempted to reduce Kelly's rank in response to the remarks. This ruling underscores ongoing debates within the military about lawful orders and discipline.</p>
