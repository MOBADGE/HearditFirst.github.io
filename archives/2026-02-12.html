    <h2>US Environmental Policy Changes</h2>
<p>President Trump has revoked a key ruling that classified greenhouse gases as a danger to public health, marking what the White House calls the largest deregulation in US history. This move ends a policy that formed the basis for many climate regulations over the past decade. Environmental groups have criticized the rollback, warning it could have costly consequences for Americans and the environment. Supporters argue that it removes burdensome regulations that hinder industry growth. This decision represents the culmination of a years-long effort by Trump to undo climate policies.</p>
<h2>Immigration Enforcement in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>"Operation Metro Surge," a recent immigration enforcement crackdown in Minneapolis, is winding down, according to a U.S. official in charge of border operations. The surge came amid concerns over immigration enforcement but resulted in the deaths of two U.S. citizens, raising questions about the operation’s impact on community safety. The reduction in enforcement activities may signal a shift in federal immigration priorities in the area going forward.</p>
<h2>International Developments: North Korea and Iran</h2>
<p>South Korea’s intelligence agency has reported that Kim Jong Un has selected his teenage daughter, Ki Ju Ae, as his heir. Her increasing public profile suggests she holds a significant future role in North Korea’s leadership. Meanwhile, satellite images show Iran is strengthening an underground complex near its nuclear site. This development is occurring amid ongoing diplomatic talks between Iranian and U.S. officials focused on Iran's nuclear program, suggesting a tense atmosphere despite efforts at negotiation.</p>
<h2>Security and Legal News in North America and Europe</h2>
<p>In Canada, police investigations revealed that the suspect in a recent mass shooting had a history of mental health struggles and that his firearms licence expired two years ago. It remains unclear who legally possessed the guns used in the attack. In Europe, Norway’s former prime minister faces a gross corruption charge linked to his past ties to Jeffrey Epstein. The charge followed the removal of his immunity by the Council of Europe, where he once served as secretary general.</p>
<h2>Natural Disaster Strikes Madagascar</h2>
<p>Madagascar’s main port city, Toamasina, has been devastated by a severe storm now moving toward Mozambique. More than half of the local population has been affected, and extensive destruction of infrastructure has been reported. The disaster highlights the ongoing vulnerability of the region to extreme weather events and may prompt emergency responses and aid from neighboring countries and international organizations.</p>
<h2>U.S. Military Legal Decision</h2>
<p>A judge has blocked efforts by the U.S. military to demote retired Navy Captain Mark Kelly after he publicly stated that servicemembers are not obligated to obey illegal orders. Defense Secretary Hegseth had sought the rank reduction in response to Kelly’s remarks. This ruling affirms protections for military personnel who speak out on legal and ethical issues related to their service.</p>
