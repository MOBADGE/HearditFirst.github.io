    <h2>US Politics and Epstein Files</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, has accused the Trump administration of delaying the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, describing the situation as a "cover-up." She called for the documents to be made public, suggesting the government is slow-walking the process. In response, the White House defended its actions, saying it has done "more for the victims than Democrats ever did." This disagreement highlights ongoing tensions over transparency and accountability in the handling of Epstein-related investigations.</p>
<h2>Iran Nuclear Talks</h2>
<p>The US president has indicated he will be "indirectly" involved in upcoming negotiations regarding Iran’s nuclear program, which are set to begin on Tuesday. He expressed optimism about the talks, stating his belief that Iran wants to reach a deal. The indirect involvement suggests the president may play a strategic or advisory role rather than direct participation. These talks are significant as they could impact international security and the diplomatic relationship between the US and Iran.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and Demographic Challenges</h2>
<p>Ukraine is addressing a sharp decline in its population by supporting efforts to preserve fertility among its troops. A new law has been introduced that funds military personnel who wish to freeze their sperm or eggs. This measure aims to help mitigate long-term demographic problems caused by the ongoing conflict and its impact on the country’s population. The policy underscores Ukraine’s broader struggle with population decline and the social effects of the war.</p>
