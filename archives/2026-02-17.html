    <h2>US Civil Rights Leader Jesse Jackson Dies</h2>
<p>Jesse Jackson, a prominent US civil rights leader, has died at the age of 84. Jackson was widely recognized as a transformative figure and an agent of change in the civil rights movement. Politicians from across the spectrum have paid tribute to his legacy. His passing marks the end of an era for many who saw him as a passionate advocate for social justice and equality.</p>
<h2>Updates on International Conflicts and Negotiations</h2>
<p>Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Geneva, marking the first day of negotiations aimed at ending the ongoing war. Although the discussions will continue, expectations for a major breakthrough remain low at this stage.</p>
<p>Separately, Iran announced that it has reached agreement on "guiding principles" with the US during recent nuclear talks, but emphasized that more work is needed before a full deal can be finalized. The US has not yet responded to Iran's statement.</p>
<h2>Crime and Law Enforcement Developments</h2>
<p>In France, nine people have been arrested following the death of Quentin Deranque, a far-right student who died after being beaten by masked individuals believed to be far-left militants. This incident has heightened tensions around political violence.</p>
<p>In the US, police identified a suspect following a shooting at a high school hockey game in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Two people were killed and three others injured during the incident.</p>
<p>In the UK, Essex Police are investigating private flights at Stansted Airport due to possible connections with Jeffrey Epstein, assessing information related to the flights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a criminal investigation in the US, no DNA matches have been found on a glove recovered in the disappearance case of Nancy Guthrie, an 84-year-old woman who has been missing for two weeks.</p>
<h2>Military Operations Against Drug Trafficking</h2>
<p>The US military reported killing eleven people in multiple strikes targeting alleged drug trafficking boats. Since September, more than 130 people have died in these operations, reflecting ongoing efforts to disrupt narco-trafficking networks.</p>
<h2>Political Leadership Changes in South Africa</h2>
<p>John Steenhuisen announced that he will not seek re-election as leader of South Africa’s second-largest political party, the Democratic Alliance (DA). His decision opens the field for new leadership, signaling a period of transition for the party.</p>
