    <h2>Violence at Rhode Island Hockey Game</h2>
<p>A shooting at a high school hockey game in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, resulted in two deaths and three injuries. Police have identified a suspect in connection with the incident. The tragedy has raised concerns about safety at public events and the ongoing issue of gun violence in community settings.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Addresses Population Decline</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing severe demographic challenges due to a sharp population decline. In response, the government has passed a law funding the freezing of eggs and sperm for military personnel. This initiative aims to preserve fertility as a way to help address future population needs amid ongoing conflict and social instability.</p>
<h2>Continued Diplomatic Efforts in Geneva</h2>
<p>A third round of talks between Ukraine and Russia began in Geneva, brokered by the United States, with the goal of negotiating an end to the conflict. Expectations for a significant breakthrough are low as military strikes continue. In related international diplomacy, nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran also concluded in Geneva, with officials reporting progress on key principles but acknowledging that further work remains.</p>
<h2>International Developments</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, the United States has deployed troops to Nigeria to assist in combating Islamist militants. The American soldiers arrived in Bauchi state but will not participate directly in combat operations, highlighting a supportive role.</p>
<h2>Political and Social News</h2>
<p>In the United States, Senator Mark Kelly has indicated he is seriously considering a run for the White House. Speaking to the BBC, he referenced the challenging times facing the country.</p>
<p>Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized the Trump administration for what she called a "cover-up" of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. She urged for transparency, while the White House defended its record on supporting victims.</p>
<p>Locally in the US, police investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie have cleared her family as suspects after three weeks of searching. Authorities emphasized that it is cruel to suggest family members are involved, calling them victims in the case.</p>
<h2>Cultural Celebrations</h2>
