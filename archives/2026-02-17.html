    <h2>US Civil Rights Leader Jesse Jackson Dies at 84</h2>
<p>Jesse Jackson, a prominent American civil rights activist, passed away at the age of 84. He was widely recognized as a transformative figure and an agent of change throughout his life. Tributes have come from various politicians who acknowledged his significant contributions to civil rights and social justice in the United States. Jackson's decades-long activism included leadership roles and efforts to promote equality, and his legacy is being remembered and reflected upon.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks Begin in Geneva</h2>
<p>Peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine started in Geneva, but after the first day, hopes for a quick resolution remain low. The talks are set to continue, though the chances for an immediate breakthrough to end the ongoing conflict appear slim. Observers see the discussions as a first step, with difficult negotiations expected ahead as both parties work toward possible resolutions.</p>
<h2>Investigations and Developments in Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Police investigations continue in several cases with varying updates:</p>
<p>- In Rhode Island, authorities have identified a suspect following a shooting at a high school hockey game in Pawtucket that left two people dead and three others injured.
- Police say there have been no DNA matches on a glove found in connection with the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, 84, two weeks after she went missing, and no arrests have been made.
- Essex Police in the UK are reviewing information related to private flights arriving and departing Stansted Airport, with potential links to Jeffrey Epstein under assessment.</p>
<h2>US Military Strikes on Alleged Drug Trafficking Boats</h2>
<p>The US military has conducted multiple strikes targeting boats suspected of involvement in drug trafficking. These operations have resulted in at least eleven deaths in recent strikes alone, contributing to a total of more than 130 people killed since September in efforts to disrupt narco-trafficking activities. The strikes reflect continued US military activity aimed at combating drug trafficking in affected regions.</p>
<h2>Political Changes in South Africa's Democratic Alliance</h2>
<p>John Steenhuisen, the leader of South Africa's second-largest political party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), announced he will not seek re-election. His decision opens the field for new leadership candidates and marks a significant moment for the party as it prepares for its next leadership phase. This change could influence the party’s future direction and strategy ahead of upcoming elections.</p>
