    <h2>Civil Rights Leader Jesse Jackson Passes Away</h2>
<p>Jesse Jackson, a prominent US civil rights leader, has died at the age of 84. He was widely recognized for his work as an agent of change and a transformative leader. Politicians across the spectrum paid tribute to his contributions to social justice and civil rights. Jackson's legacy includes decades of activism aimed at promoting racial equality and political participation.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks Begin in Geneva</h2>
<p>The first day of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place in Geneva. While talks will continue, there are low expectations for a rapid breakthrough to end the ongoing conflict. This initial meeting represents a step towards dialogue, but challenges remain as both sides seek solutions amidst continued hostilities.</p>
<h2>Violence and Investigations in France and the US</h2>
<p>In France, nine people were arrested following the death of Quentin Deranque, a far-right student who died after being beaten by masked individuals believed to be far-left militants in Lyon. The incident has heightened tensions between political groups.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, a shooting at a high school hockey game in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, left two people dead and three injured. Police have identified a suspect as the investigation continues.</p>
<h2>US Military Strikes Against Drug Trafficking Operations</h2>
<p>The US military reported killing eleven people in multiple strikes targeting boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking. Since September, over 130 individuals have been killed in these operations aimed at combating narco-trafficking. These actions are part of ongoing efforts to disrupt illegal drug networks.</p>
<h2>Developments in International Nuclear and Aviation Investigations</h2>
<p>Iran announced that "guiding principles" have been agreed upon with the US at ongoing nuclear talks, although more work is needed to reach a final deal. The US has not yet commented on this progress.</p>
<p>Separately, Essex Police in the UK are assessing information related to private flights at Stansted Airport that may have connections to Jeffrey Epstein. The inquiry is ongoing, with authorities reviewing flight data and related evidence.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Updates</h2>
<p>In Zambia, the family of former President Lungu has dismissed allegations that he was poisoned. His body remains in a morgue in South Africa, and his fate continues to be a subject of public interest.</p>
<p>In the realm of sports, six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will compete under their national flags at the upcoming Winter Paralympics, marking a notable participation ahead of the international event.</p>
<h2>Missing Person Case in the US Remains Unresolved</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to investigate the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie. No DNA matches have been found on a glove discovered in connection with the case, and no arrests have been made two weeks after her disappearance. The investigation remains active.</p>
