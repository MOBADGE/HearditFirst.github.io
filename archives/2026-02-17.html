    <h2>US Politics and Epstein Files</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton has accused the Trump administration of delaying the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, describing the hold-up as a "cover-up" in a recent BBC interview. She urged authorities to make the documents public more quickly. The White House responded by saying it has done more to support Epstein’s victims than previous Democratic administrations. This ongoing dispute highlights continuing political tensions over transparency and accountability in the Epstein case.</p>
<h2>Iran Nuclear Talks</h2>
<p>Ahead of upcoming negotiations, the US president said he expects Iran to be interested in reaching a nuclear deal. Although he stated he will be "indirectly" involved in the talks, he expressed optimism about a potential agreement. These talks are seen as a critical step in addressing concerns about Iran’s nuclear program and regional stability. How the negotiations proceed could have major implications for international relations and security.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and Demographic Challenges</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing a rapid population decline and has introduced a new law to support its military personnel in preserving their fertility. The legislation funds the freezing of eggs or sperm for troops who may face reproductive risks due to the ongoing conflict and demographic crisis. This measure reflects broader concerns about long-term population trends affecting the country’s future workforce and societal stability. It also underscores the personal toll of conflict on military members.</p>
