    <h2>Civil Rights and Global Legacy</h2>
<p>Jesse Jackson, a prominent US civil rights leader, has died at the age of 84. Known for his tireless work as an agent of change, Jackson was widely praised by politicians who recognized him as a transformative figure in the fight for equality and justice. His passing marks a significant moment for those who see him as an inspiration and pioneer in civil rights activism.</p>
<h2>Violence and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>In France, nine people have been arrested following the death of Quentin Deranque, a far-right student who succumbed to injuries after being beaten in Lyon by masked attackers believed to be far-left militants. This incident highlights ongoing political tensions and violence connected with extremist groups in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Rhode Island, police have identified a suspect linked to a shooting at a high school hockey game in Pawtucket that left two people dead and three others injured. The event has added to concerns over violent incidents at public gatherings.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>
<p>Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine convened in Geneva, marking the first day of negotiations aimed at ending the conflict between the two nations. Although discussions are set to continue, expectations remain low for an imminent breakthrough, reflecting the complexities and deep-rooted issues in the ongoing war.</p>
<p>In addition, Iran announced that "guiding principles" were agreed upon with the United States during nuclear talks, though more work is needed before a comprehensive deal can be reached. The US has yet to comment on this development, indicating that negotiations remain delicate and ongoing.</p>
<h2>Security and Investigations</h2>
<p>In the UK, Essex Police are reviewing information related to private flights at Stansted Airport that may have connections to Jeffrey Epstein. The police assessment is part of a broader effort to understand possible illegal activities involving private air travel.</p>
<p>Separately, in the US military's ongoing efforts to disrupt drug trafficking, eleven people have been killed in multiple strikes targeting alleged drug boats since September. These operations have resulted in over 130 deaths overall, underscoring a sustained campaign against narcotics smuggling by sea.</p>
<h2>Sports and Controversy</h2>
<p>Ahead of the upcoming Winter Paralympics, six Russian and four Belarusian athletes are set to compete under their national flags. This decision is notable because athletes from these countries have faced restrictions in recent international sporting events amid geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These updates reflect significant developments in civil rights history, international diplomacy, security concerns, and sports as of February 17, 2026. The coming days may reveal more on peace negotiations, ongoing investigations, and responses to recent violence.</p>
