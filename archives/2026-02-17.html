    <div class="date">February 17, 2026</div>
    <h2>Civil Rights and Global Leadership</h2>
<p>Jesse Jackson, a prominent US civil rights leader, passed away at the age of 84. Jackson was widely regarded as an agent of change and a transformative figure. Political leaders and others paid tribute to his long-lasting impact on civil rights and social justice. His death marks the loss of an influential voice in the ongoing fight for equality.</p>
<h2>Violence and Crime Updates</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting at a high school hockey game in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, resulted in two deaths and three injuries. Authorities have identified a suspect in connection with the incident. Meanwhile, in France, nine people have been arrested over the death of Quentin Deranque, a student who died after being beaten by masked men believed to be far-left militants in Lyon. These events highlight ongoing concerns about violence and political extremism.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy and Security</h2>
<p>Diplomatic efforts continue on several fronts. Talks between Russia and Ukraine began in Geneva, with negotiations set to continue. However, expectations for a rapid resolution to the conflict remain low. In the Middle East, Iran announced that it and the US have agreed on some “guiding principles” in nuclear negotiations, though Tehran noted more work is needed to reach a full agreement. The US has yet to comment on this development. Additionally, United States soldiers have arrived in Nigeria to support the country’s fight against Islamist militants, although they will not participate in combat operations.</p>
<h2>Legal and Investigative Matters</h2>
<p>France has released a tanker suspected of being part of a Russian "shadow fleet" after a fine of several million euros was paid, according to the French Foreign Minister. In the UK, Essex Police are reviewing information about private flights to and from Stansted Airport potentially linked to Jeffrey Epstein. This investigation is ongoing as authorities assess possible connections.</p>
<h2>Consumer and Health Concerns</h2>
<p>The European Union is investigating Shein, the fast fashion company, over concerns that it may have violated the Digital Services Act by marketing childlike sex dolls. This probe reflects growing scrutiny of products and marketing practices that may breach consumer protection laws or ethical standards.</p>
<h2>Africa Political Update</h2>
<p>In Zambia, the family of the country’s former president Hakainde Hichilema's predecessor, Edgar Lungu, has dismissed allegations that Lungu was poisoned. Lungu’s body remains in a South African morgue, and disputes around the cause of death and the handling of his remains persist. This development adds uncertainty to the political climate in Zambia.</p>
