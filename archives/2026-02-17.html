    <h2>International Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>
<p>The third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine began in Geneva, brokered by the United States, aiming to find an end to the ongoing war. However, expectations for significant progress are low as the conflict continues with ongoing strikes. In related diplomatic news, nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran concluded in Geneva with officials saying they reached an understanding on key guiding principles, though further work is required to finalize agreements.</p>
<h2>Developments Related to Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton has accused the Trump administration of deliberately delaying the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. She urged for the files to be made public, claiming the government is "slow-walking" the process. The White House responded by stating it has done more for Epstein's victims than previous Democratic administrations. Meanwhile, Thomas Pritzker, chairman of Hyatt Hotels, resigned due to his ties with Epstein, acknowledging he showed "terrible judgement" in maintaining contact with him.</p>
<h2>Legal and Investigative Updates</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, state officials reported that the FBI is refusing to cooperate in the investigation of Alex Pretti by withholding evidence. This lack of cooperation is affecting the progress of the case. In another ongoing investigation, local police have cleared the family of Nancy Guthrie, a missing woman, from suspicion, emphasizing that the family members are victims themselves and condemning any suggestions to the contrary as cruel.</p>
<h2>Tragedy in Spain</h2>
<p>A fire in an apartment block in Spain resulted in the deaths of five young people. Firefighters are still investigating why the victims were unable to escape from the upper floors of the building. The cause of the fire has not been disclosed, and emergency services continue their work to understand the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.</p>
<h2>Cultural Celebrations</h2>
<p>Around the world, millions are marking the Lunar New Year 2026 with celebrations spanning from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires. The festivities highlight the cultural significance and widespread observance of the holiday, bringing communities together in various countries to welcome the new year.</p>
<h2>Political Considerations in the US</h2>
<p>In the United States, Senator Mark Kelly said in a BBC interview that he will "seriously consider" running for the White House. Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, described the current times as "seriously challenging," suggesting his potential candidacy is influenced by national issues and concerns.</p>
