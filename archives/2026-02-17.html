    <h2>US Politics and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton has accused the Trump administration of delaying the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, calling it a "cover-up" in a recent BBC interview. She urged authorities to "get the files out," expressing frustration over what she described as slow progress. In response, the White House said it has done "more for the victims than Democrats ever did." Meanwhile, billionaire Thomas Pritzker, chairman of Hyatt Hotels, stepped down after admitting he showed "terrible judgement" by maintaining contact with Epstein.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, the state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension reported that the FBI is refusing to cooperate by withholding evidence in the ongoing investigation of Alex Pretti. This development raises concerns about the progress and transparency of the case.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>New nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran began in Geneva with cautious optimism from both sides. The US president expressed a belief that Iran is interested in reaching a deal, while Tehran indicated that Washington appears to be adopting a more realistic stance. These talks could have significant implications for regional stability and non-proliferation efforts.</p>
<h2>Ukraine's Demographic Challenges</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing a severe population decline, which officials describe as a demographic catastrophe. In response, a new law has been passed to fund the freezing of eggs and sperm for Ukrainian troops. This measure aims to help preserve the population during a period of ongoing conflict and social upheaval, highlighting the broader societal impacts of the war.</p>
<h2>US Political Ambitions</h2>
<p>US Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, told the BBC that he will "seriously consider" a run for the White House. He emphasized the challenging times the country is facing, signaling an interest in playing a larger role in addressing national issues. His potential candidacy will add to the growing field of prospects for the next presidential election.</p>
<h2>International and Domestic Events</h2>
<p>Millions of people worldwide are celebrating the Lunar New Year, with festivities stretching from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires. This annual event brings together cultural traditions and public celebrations to welcome the new lunar calendar year.</p>
<p>In Spain, five young people died in an apartment block fire. Firefighters reported uncertainty about why the victims could not escape from the upper floor of the building, prompting investigations into the cause and safety measures.</p>
