    <h2>US Political Controversy</h2>
<p>Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused the Trump administration of deliberately delaying the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Speaking in a BBC interview, she criticized what she described as a "cover-up" and urged that the documents be made public promptly. The White House responded by defending its record, stating it had done more for victims of exploitation and abuse than previous Democratic administrations. This exchange highlights ongoing tensions around transparency and accountability related to Epstein’s case.</p>
<h2>US Involvement in Iran Nuclear Talks</h2>
<p>Ahead of upcoming negotiations on Tuesday, the US president stated that he would be "indirectly" involved in the Iran nuclear talks. He expressed optimism that Iran was interested in reaching an agreement. These discussions are significant because they could impact international efforts to manage Iran’s nuclear program and regional security. The president’s indirect role suggests a degree of distance while maintaining influence over the outcome.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Addresses Population Decline Amid Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing a severe demographic challenge, with its population rapidly declining. In response, the government has passed a law that funds the freezing of eggs and sperm for Ukrainian troops. This measure aims to give service members the option to preserve their fertility given the risks they face during ongoing conflict. The policy shows an effort to mitigate long-term social and demographic consequences stemming from the current situation in the country.</p>
