    <h2>Global Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>
<p>A third round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations is underway as both sides attempt to negotiate an end to the ongoing war. However, expectations for significant progress remain low amid continued strikes. Simultaneously, new nuclear negotiations have begun between the United States and Iran in Geneva. The US president expressed optimism that Iran is interested in reaching a deal, while Iranian officials believe the US has adopted a more practical stance.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Politics and Investigations</h2>
<p>US Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, told the BBC he will "seriously consider" running for the White House, citing the challenging times the country faces. Meanwhile, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused the Trump administration of a "cover-up" regarding files related to Jeffrey Epstein, criticizing delays in releasing the documents. The White House responded by stating it has done "more for the victims than Democrats ever did." Additionally, billionaire Thomas Pritzker, chairman of Hyatt Hotels, resigned after acknowledging he made "terrible judgement" in maintaining contact with Epstein.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Crime</h2>
<p>Five young people tragically died in a fire at an apartment block in Spain. Firefighters are investigating why the victims were unable to escape the blaze, which was confined to the upper floor. In Australia, former rugby league player Matt Utai is in critical condition after being shot multiple times outside his Sydney home. In Minnesota, US state officials reported that the FBI is refusing to cooperate by withholding evidence in an investigation related to an individual named Alex Pretti.</p>
<h2>Cultural Celebrations</h2>
<p>Millions around the world are marking the Lunar New Year, with festivities happening in locations from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires. The celebrations highlight the global significance of this annual event as communities observe traditional customs to welcome the new year.</p>
<h2>Reflections on Civil Rights Legacy</h2>
<p>A recent feature revisited the impact of a key US civil rights activist who worked alongside Martin Luther King Jr. The individual’s influence extended from grassroots church movements in the Deep South to shaping policies at the White House, underlining the lasting legacy of the civil rights movement in America today.</p>
