    <h2>US Politics and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, has accused the Trump administration of deliberately delaying the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. In an interview with the BBC, she urged authorities to "get the files out" and suggested they were being "slow-walked." The White House responded by stating that the current administration has done "more for the victims than Democrats ever did." This ongoing dispute highlights tensions over transparency and accountability surrounding the Epstein case, with potential implications for public trust and future investigations.</p>
<h2>Iran Nuclear Talks</h2>
<p>The US president announced he would be "indirectly" involved in upcoming nuclear negotiations with Iran, which were scheduled to begin on Tuesday. He expressed optimism that Iran is interested in reaching a deal. This cautious involvement signals a possible shift in the diplomatic approach after years of fluctuating relations, suggesting that direct negotiations may continue to be sensitive but could lead to progress in nuclear non-proliferation efforts.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Demographics and Military Policy</h2>
<p>Ukraine is confronting a significant demographic challenge as its population declines sharply. In response, the government passed a law providing funds for military personnel who wish to freeze their eggs or sperm. This policy aims to help safeguard the future reproductive options of troops serving in difficult conditions. It reflects broader concerns about the country's population trends and attempts to support families and soldiers during an ongoing period of national strain.</p>
