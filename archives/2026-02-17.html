    <h2>US Politics and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused the Trump administration of "slow-walking" the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein in a recent BBC interview. She called for the files to be made public, suggesting a deliberate cover-up. In response, the White House defended its record on the issue, stating it has done "more for the victims than Democrats ever did." Meanwhile, billionaire Thomas Pritzker, chairman of Hyatt Hotels, announced he is stepping down due to his past connections with Epstein, admitting he showed "terrible judgement" by maintaining contact with him.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
