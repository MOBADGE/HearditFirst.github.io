    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The US secretary of state has reassured European leaders that the Trump administration remains committed to the transatlantic alliance. Despite recent tensions, the secretary emphasized that the United States and Europe “belong together,” signaling continued support for cooperation on shared challenges.</p>
<h2>Health and Ethics</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization has criticized a planned US-funded vaccine trial in Guinea-Bissau. The trial involves giving some newborns an established hepatitis B treatment while withholding it from others. The WHO called the study “unethical,” highlighting concerns about fairness and the well-being of vulnerable infants.</p>
<h2>Russia and Security</h2>
<p>The UK government has accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny by poisoning him with a toxin derived from a dart frog. Officials stated that the presence of the toxin in samples taken from Navalny’s body has no innocent explanation, suggesting a deliberate act.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>Authorities conducted a search near the home of Nancy Guthrie in Tucson, Arizona. The 84-year-old woman had been abducted nearly two weeks ago. So far, no arrests have been made in connection with the case.</p>
<h2>Cuba’s Energy Crisis</h2>
<p>Cuba’s worsening energy crisis, exacerbated by the US blockade, continues to impact daily life and events. An annual cigar festival popular with aficionados has been postponed indefinitely due to shortages affecting international travel. Additionally, a fire at an oil refinery was reported but quickly contained. The fire comes amid dwindling fuel and electricity supplies.</p>
<h2>US Homeland Security</h2>
<p>A shutdown at the US Department of Homeland Security may cause delays at airports. While air traffic controllers will not be affected, some Transportation Security Administration (TSA) workers might have to work without pay, according to travel groups, raising concerns about passenger screening and airport operations.</p>
