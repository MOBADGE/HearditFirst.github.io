    <h2>Justice and Healing in France</h2>
<p>Gisèle Pelicot, a central figure in France's largest rape trial, shared her experience in an in-depth interview with BBC's Newsnight. She spoke about feeling "crushed by horror" but emphasized that she does not harbor anger. Her reflections explore themes of betrayal and the challenging process of healing. Pelicot also discussed her efforts to choose a constructive path forward amid difficult circumstances.

<h2>Political Change in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Tarique Rahman is poised to become Bangladesh's next prime minister following a recent electoral landslide. His rise comes about 18 months after widespread protests led to the removal of the country's longest-serving leader. Rahman's leadership marks a significant shift in the country's political landscape. Observers are watching to see how he will address the challenges facing Bangladesh and whether his administration will bring change after a period of unrest.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns in the United States</h2>
<p>In the United States, discussions about a potential shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security have raised concerns about travel disruptions. While air traffic controllers are expected to continue working, some TSA employees might face unpaid leave if the shutdown occurs. Travel groups warn this could lead to longer airport delays, potentially affecting passengers and travel plans. The situation underscores the impact of government funding issues on public services and daily life.</p>
<h2>Crisis and Response in Cuba</h2>
<p>Cuba is facing intensified challenges with fuel shortages and power supply issues, compounded by a recent fire at an oil refinery. Officials reported that the blaze was contained quickly, but it comes at a difficult time as the country grapples with dwindling resources. The incident draws attention to the ongoing fuel crisis and its potential effects on Cuba's energy stability and economy.</p>
<h2>Support and Mourning in Canada</h2>
<p>In Canada, the prime minister joined federal leaders at a vigil in Tumbler Ridge to honor eight victims of a recent tragedy. Speaking at the event, the prime minister expressed solidarity, saying, "Canadians are with you." The gathering reflected national mourning and community support in the wake of loss, highlighting the importance of collective remembrance and healing.</p>
<h2>Culture and Reflection</h2>
<p>The enduring impact of writer Arundhati Roy's work is being recognized as her debut film, a campus satire from nearly four decades ago, is set for screening in Berlin. Roy, a Booker Prize-winning author, continues to resonate with audiences through her early storytelling, which remains relevant in today's cultural and political contexts. This event showcases the lasting influence of her creative voice.</p>
