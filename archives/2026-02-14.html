    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>US-Europe Relations</h2>
<p>The US secretary of state emphasized the importance of the transatlantic alliance, reassuring European leaders that despite current tensions, the US and Europe "belong together." This statement from the Trump administration signals continued support for collaboration between the two regions amid ongoing political challenges. Strengthening this partnership remains a key focus as global issues demand cooperative action.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In France, Gisèle Pelicot, at the center of the nation's largest rape trial, shared her experience in an interview. She spoke about feelings of betrayal, the process of healing, and her commitment to making positive choices moving forward. Her reflections offer insight into the personal impact of the case and the broader societal conversations about justice and recovery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, former president Obama addressed a racist video that had circulated depicting him as an ape. Without naming the source directly, he criticized the absence of "shame" and decency among some public officials. His remarks highlight ongoing concerns about racism and the tone of political discourse.</p>
<h2>Health and Ethics</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization criticized a planned US-funded vaccine trial in Guinea-Bissau involving hepatitis B treatment for newborns. The WHO described the study design, which includes giving the treatment to some babies but not others, as "unethical." This controversy raises important questions about research ethics and the protection of vulnerable populations in medical trials.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>Law enforcement in Tucson, Arizona, conducted a search near the residence of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, who was abducted two weeks earlier. No arrests have been made so far. The investigation remains active as authorities seek resolution and public safety reassurances.</p>
<p>Additionally, two people were arrested at the Rio Carnival in Brazil after police, using drone surveillance, caught a woman stealing a phone. Officers had dressed in costume to blend in with the festivities, a tactic that successfully curbed theft during the event.</p>
<h2>Energy and Economic Challenges</h2>
<p>Cuba is facing worsening energy and fuel shortages that have forced the postponement of its annual cigar festival, an event popular with aficionados worldwide. These difficulties are linked to the ongoing US blockade affecting travel and supply chains.</p>
<p>The crisis deepened with a fire at an oil refinery in Cuba. Officials reported that the blaze was quickly contained, but the incident underscores the country's fragile fuel and electricity situation. These energy challenges could have broader implications for the Cuban economy and daily life moving forward.</p>
