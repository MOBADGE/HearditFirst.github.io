    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>Transatlantic Relations</h2>
<p>The US Secretary of State has reassured European leaders that despite recent tensions, the United States and Europe "belong together." This message signals ongoing support from the Trump administration for the transatlantic alliance, which is important for diplomatic cooperation and shared security interests. The statement aims to maintain strong ties at a time when some disagreements have raised questions about the future of US-Europe relations.</p>
<h2>High-Profile Legal Case in France</h2>
<p>Gisèle Pelicot, central to France's largest rape trial, spoke publicly about her experience in an interview. She discussed feelings of being overwhelmed by horror but emphasized that she does not feel anger. Her reflections touch on themes of betrayal, healing, and the importance of making positive choices after trauma. The case remains a significant part of France's ongoing struggle with issues of justice and support for survivors.</p>
<h2>Developments in Missing Person Case</h2>
<p>Police activity is underway near the home of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie in Tucson, Arizona. This follows her abduction nearly two weeks ago. Authorities have conducted a search in the area as part of efforts to find her and gather information about the circumstances surrounding the case. The investigation is active, with the public awaiting further updates.</p>
<h2>Public Mourning in Canada</h2>
<p>Canada's Prime Minister attended a vigil in Tumbler Ridge alongside other federal leaders to honor eight victims. The gathering was a moment of national reflection and solidarity, showing support for the affected communities. The prime minister also conveyed a message that "Canadians are with you," offering reassurance amid grief.</p>
<h2>Controversy Over Vaccine Trial in Africa</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization criticized a planned US-funded vaccine trial in Guinea-Bissau. The trial would involve giving some newborns an established hepatitis B treatment while withholding it from others. The WHO called this approach "unethical," highlighting concerns about fairness and medical ethics in clinical trials. This dispute raises questions about how global health studies are conducted in lower-income countries.</p>
<h2>International Security and Health Concerns</h2>
<p>UK officials have accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny using a toxin derived from a dart frog. The Foreign Office stated there is no innocent explanation for the presence of this poison in samples taken from Navalny’s body. This allegation adds to ongoing diplomatic tensions and concerns about political violence.</p>
<p>In Cuba, a fire broke out at an oil refinery amid an already deepening fuel and electricity crisis. Although Cuban officials said the fire was quickly contained, the event underscores the country’s ongoing energy challenges.</p>
<h2>US Homeland Security and Travel Delays</h2>
<p>A potential shutdown of the US Department of Homeland Security could lead to delays at airports. While air traffic controllers would continue working, some Transportation Security Administration (TSA) workers might face unpaid periods. Travel groups have warned that this could disrupt airport security processes and cause inconvenience for travelers.</p>
<h2>Political Change in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Tarique Rahman is poised to become Bangladesh’s next prime minister following a recent election landslide. This comes about 18 months after mass protests led to the removal of the country’s longest-serving leader. Rahman’s leadership marks a significant political shift, with public expectations focused on whether his administration can bring meaningful change.</p>
