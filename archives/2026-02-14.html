    <h2>Crime and Justice in France</h2>
<p>Gisèle Pelicot, a key figure in what is described as France's biggest rape trial, spoke in an extended interview about her experience and emotions. Despite describing feelings of horror and betrayal, she stated she does not feel anger. Pelicot discussed her personal journey toward healing and making positive choices following the trauma. Her reflections shed light on the emotional impact of the trial and may influence wider conversations about justice and recovery for victims.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Tarique Rahman is expected to assume office as Bangladesh's next prime minister following a decisive election victory. This transition comes about 18 months after mass protests led to the removal of the country's longest-serving leader. Rahman's rise signals a significant political change, and many are watching to see how his leadership might address the nation's challenges and push for progress.</p>
<h2>Security and Travel in the United States</h2>
<p>A partial shutdown has affected US homeland security agencies, which could lead to travel disruptions. While air traffic controllers are not impacted, some Transportation Security Administration (TSA) workers may have to work without pay. This situation could result in longer airport wait times and delays, raising concern for travelers and travel groups during what is typically a busy time.</p>
<h2>Incident and Fuel Crisis in Cuba</h2>
<p>An oil refinery in Cuba caught fire recently, though officials reported the blaze was quickly contained. This incident occurs amid an ongoing electricity and fuel shortage on the island. The combination of the fire and limited energy supplies adds strain to the country’s infrastructure and may complicate recovery efforts in the near term.</p>
<h2>Social Observations in Kenya</h2>
<p>Valentine's Day in Kenya has seen a rise in the popularity of bouquets made from cash rather than flowers. However, some warnings have been issued that could slow this trend. The practice reflects changing cultural expressions of love and generosity but also raises questions about social and economic implications.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>Nearly four decades after its release, a debut campus satire by writer Arundhati Roy continues to resonate. The Booker Prize-winning author's work is set to be screened in Berlin, highlighting its enduring relevance. This event underscores the lasting impact of Roy's cultural contributions and the ongoing interest in South Asian narratives on the global stage.</p>
