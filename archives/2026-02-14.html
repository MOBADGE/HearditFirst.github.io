    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The US Secretary of State emphasized the strong bond between the United States and Europe despite recent tensions. Speaking to European leaders, he reassured them that the administration led by Donald Trump remains committed to the transatlantic alliance. This message underlines the continued importance of cooperation between the US and European countries on global and security issues.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Justice</h2>
<p>Gisèle Pelicot, central to France's largest rape trial, shared her personal experience in an interview with Newsnight. She described feeling overwhelmed by horror but stated she does not harbor anger. She spoke about feelings of betrayal, the process of healing, and the importance of choosing a path forward. Her reflections shed light on the resilience needed by survivors in seeking justice.</p>
<h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>In Tucson, Arizona, police conducted a search near the home of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, who was abducted almost two weeks ago. Law enforcement activity in the area shows ongoing efforts to locate the missing woman and gather evidence to solve the case.</p>
<h2>Public Health Ethics</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization criticized a planned US-funded vaccine trial in Guinea-Bissau. The trial involved giving some newborns an established hepatitis B treatment while withholding it from others. The WHO called such practices "unethical," raising important questions about consent, equity, and ethics in medical research within low-income countries.</p>
<h2>Russia and Opposition Leader Investigation</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office stated that Russian agents used a toxin derived from dart frogs to kill Alexei Navalny, an opposition figure. Officials said there is no innocent explanation for the presence of the toxin in Navalny's body samples. This development highlights ongoing concerns about targeted poisoning and political repression in Russia.</p>
<h2>Cuba’s Energy Crisis</h2>
<p>Cuba is facing a worsening energy shortage caused by a US blockade and other factors. An oil refinery recently experienced a fire, though officials reported it was quickly contained. Due to the fuel and electricity crisis, the country's annual cigar festival for enthusiasts has been postponed indefinitely. These events reflect the growing difficulties in Cuba’s infrastructure and international relations.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Concerns</h2>
<p>A shutdown of the US Department of Homeland Security could lead to some disruptions at airports. While air traffic controllers would remain on duty, some Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees may face unpaid work periods. Travel groups warn that this situation could cause delays and frustration for passengers. The situation underscores the fragility of public services during budget or political stalemates.</p>
<h2>Canadian Vigil for Victims</h2>
<p>In Canada, the prime minister attended a vigil at Tumbler Ridge to honor the eight victims of a recent tragedy. Federal leaders joined in paying tribute, conveying national solidarity and support for those affected. The gathering highlights the ongoing process of mourning and community healing.</p>
