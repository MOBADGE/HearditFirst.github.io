    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The US secretary of state has reaffirmed the Trump administration's commitment to the transatlantic alliance, emphasizing that the United States and Europe "belong together" despite recent tensions. This reassurance comes amid concerns over strains in the relationship, with the aim of maintaining strong cooperation on global issues. The statement signals a continued emphasis on US-European collaboration moving forward.</p>
<h2>Health and Ethics</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization has criticized a planned US-funded vaccine trial in Guinea-Bissau. The trial intended to give some newborns an established hepatitis B treatment while withholding it from others. The WHO deemed this approach "unethical," raising questions about the trial’s design and its implications for medical research ethics in vulnerable populations.</p>
<h2>Russia and Opposition Leader Alexei Navalny</h2>
<p>The UK Foreign Office has stated that Russia killed opposition leader Alexei Navalny using dart frog toxin. Officials emphasized that there is no innocent explanation for the presence of the toxin in samples taken from Navalny's body, highlighting serious concerns about the circumstances of his poisoning. This finding adds to ongoing international scrutiny of Russia's actions toward political dissidents.</p>
<h2>Cuba’s Energy and Fuel Crisis</h2>
<p>Cuba is facing a worsening energy crisis that has caused significant disruptions. An oil refinery blaze was reportedly contained quickly, but it exacerbates the country's shrinking supplies of electricity and fuel. Additionally, the annual Cuban cigar festival has been postponed indefinitely due to shortages hampering international travel and event logistics. These developments underline the growing challenges Cuba faces amid ongoing fuel shortages.</p>
<h2>US Domestic and Legal News</h2>
<p>A search was carried out by police near the home of Nancy Guthrie in Tucson, Arizona, following her abduction nearly two weeks ago. No arrests have been made as the investigation continues. Separately, Casey Wasserman, an influential talent agent and LA Olympics chief, announced plans to sell his agency following scrutiny over past connections with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>In a legal case in the US, Nikhil Gupta has admitted to plotting to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US-based Sikh separatist leader. Gupta faces a potential 40-year prison sentence for the murder-for-hire plot, highlighting ongoing security concerns related to political activism and targeted violence.</p>
<h2>Public Commentary</h2>
<p>Former US president Barack Obama addressed a recent racist video shared by Donald Trump that depicted Obama as an ape. Obama did not directly name Trump but expressed disappointment over the lack of "shame" and "decorum" among public officials, reflecting ongoing tensions in US political discourse.</p>
