    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 14, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The US secretary of state emphasized that the United States and Europe remain closely connected despite ongoing tensions. Speaking to European leaders, the official assured that the administration supports the transatlantic alliance. This reassurance comes amid concerns about the strength of cooperation between the US and its European partners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UK Foreign Office accused Russia of killing opposition leader Alexei Navalny using a rare dart frog toxin. Officials stated there is no innocent explanation for the toxin’s presence in Navalny's body, underlining the seriousness of the allegations. Russia has not responded within the articles provided.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>In France, Gisèle Pelicot spoke about her experience in what has become the country's largest rape trial. In an interview with Newsnight, she described feeling overwhelmed by horror but stated she does not feel anger. Her comments reflect the personal and broader societal impact of the case as proceedings continue.</p>
<p>In the United States, police conducted a search near Tuscon, Arizona, close to the home of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie. The search operation relates to her abduction nearly two weeks earlier. Details about suspects or progress in the investigation were not included.</p>
<h2>Public Health Concerns</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization criticized a planned vaccine trial in Guinea-Bissau funded by the US. The trial proposes to give some newborns an established hepatitis B treatment while others would not receive it. The WHO called this approach unethical, highlighting concerns about the fairness and safety of the study design.</p>
<h2>Practical Challenges and Crises</h2>
<p>Cuba is facing a deepening energy crisis worsened by the US blockade. An oil refinery recently caught fire but was contained quickly by officials. At the same time, fuel and electricity shortages have intensified, leading to the cancellation of the annual Cuban cigar festival, an event important to enthusiasts and the island's cultural heritage. International travel difficulties accompanying the crisis also contributed to postponing the festival.</p>
<p>In the United States, a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security raises concerns about disruptions in airport security. While air traffic control will continue unaffected, some Transportation Security Administration employees may not be paid during the shutdown, possibly causing delays and inconvenience for travelers.</p>
<h2>Community and Memorials</h2>
<p>In Canada, the prime minister attended a vigil in Tumbler Ridge to honor eight victims. The event included federal leaders and was marked by expressions of solidarity and remembrance. The gesture aimed to bring comfort to the community during a difficult time and underline national support.</p>
