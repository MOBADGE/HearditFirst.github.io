    <h2>International Politics: Bangladesh’s Leadership Change</h2>
<p>Tarique Rahman is expected to become the next prime minister of Bangladesh following a recent election landslide. This development comes about 18 months after widespread protests led to the removal of the country’s longest-serving leader. Rahman’s leadership marks a significant political shift, with many observers watching to see if he can deliver on promises of change in the nation’s governance and policies.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice: France’s Largest Rape Trial</h2>
<p>Gisèle Pelicot, a central figure in France’s largest rape trial, spoke publicly about her experience in an extensive interview. She described feeling "crushed by horror" but emphasized that she does not feel anger. Pelicot discussed themes of betrayal and healing, highlighting her focus on choosing the right path forward despite the trauma involved. Her testimony and perspective bring important human insight into a case that has captured national attention in France.</p>
<h2>Security and Law Enforcement: Search in Arizona</h2>
<p>A police search operation was carried out in Tucson, Arizona, near the home of Nancy Guthrie, an 84-year-old woman who was abducted nearly two weeks ago.

<h2>Economy and Infrastructure: Cuba’s Fuel Crisis Worsens</h2>
<p>An oil refinery in Cuba caught fire but officials say the blaze was quickly contained. This incident comes amid an already strained fuel and electricity supply situation in the country. The fire adds pressure to Cuba’s economic challenges, as fuel shortages continue to impact daily life and the nation’s energy infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Transportation: US Homeland Security Shutdown Effects</h2>
<p>The recent shutdown of the US Department of Homeland Security is causing concern for travelers. While air traffic controllers will continue working without disruption, some Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees may have to work without pay, which could lead to increased airport delays. Travel industry groups warn that this shutdown might affect airport efficiency and traveler experience if it persists.</p>
<h2>Society and Culture: Support for Victims in Canada</h2>
<p>In Tumbler Ridge, Canada, the prime minister joined federal leaders at a vigil to honor eight victims of a recent tragedy.
