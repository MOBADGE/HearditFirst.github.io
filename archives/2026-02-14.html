    <h2>US Homeland Security Shutdown Impact</h2>
<p>A partial shutdown of the US Department of Homeland Security has begun, affecting some of its operations. Air traffic controllers will continue working, but certain Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees might not receive pay during the shutdown. This could potentially cause delays at airports as some security functions face disruptions. Travel and airport groups have expressed concern about how the shutdown might affect passengers, though the full extent remains uncertain at this stage.</p>
