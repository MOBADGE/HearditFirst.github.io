    <div class="date">December 13, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>
<p>Belarus has released 123 prisoners, including opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, following a deal reached with the United States that also led to the lifting of certain US sanctions. This move could signal a potential thaw in relations, though details about the broader context or next steps remain limited.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fighting continues in several regions. In Cambodia, authorities have shut border crossings with Thailand amid ongoing clashes. This development comes despite US President Donald Trump stating that both sides had agreed to a ceasefire, highlighting ongoing tensions and uncertainty in the region. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, a recent "historic" peace deal brokered in Washington is under threat after rebels seized a key city, indicating that conflict persists despite diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Under Attack</h2>
<p>Ukraine faces increased pressure as a series of Russian strikes have severely damaged medical warehouses that supply most of the country's pharmacies. This has disrupted the availability of vital health supplies across Ukraine. Additionally, overnight attacks on Ukraine’s power grid have left around one million households without electricity. These assaults come as US envoy Steve Witkoff prepares for further talks with Ukraine's president, underscoring ongoing international engagement amid the conflict.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Events</h2>
<p>In India, a public event featuring football star Lionel Messi turned chaotic when angry fans threw chairs and bottles. Messi, who plays for Inter Miami and the Argentina national team, is currently on a tour that includes stops in cities such as Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Lagos is hosting a street art festival that transforms the city into an open-air gallery. Although Lagos is known for its vibrant arts scene and nightlife, street art is a relatively new form of creative expression there. The festival aims to showcase this aspect of the city's cultural life.</p>
<h2>Notable Public Figures and Entertainment</h2>
<p>New photographs have emerged from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate showing Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton. These images, provided to the US House Oversight Committee, do not imply any wrongdoing but have attracted attention due to the individuals involved.</p>
<p>In the entertainment world, professional wrestler John Cena is set to conclude his career with a final fight on Saturday night. Known for the catchphrase "You Can’t See Me," Cena’s farewell marks the end of a significant chapter in wrestling history.</p>
<h2>Unusual News from Virginia</h2>
<p>In a lighter story, a raccoon suspected of being intoxicated has been linked to a break-in at a karate shop in Virginia. The same animal, dubbed the "trashed panda," is also believed to have burglarised snacks from the local Department of Motor Vehicles, providing a quirky note amid broader news.</p>
