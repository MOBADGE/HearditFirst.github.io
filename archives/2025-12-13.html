    <h2>Eastern Europe and Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Belarus has released 123 prisoners, including opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, following a deal with the United States. This move coincides with the US lifting sanctions on Belarus, signaling a possible shift in diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, Ukraine continues to face severe challenges as Russian forces attacked its energy grid overnight, leaving one million households without power. Alongside this, Russia has targeted medical warehouse facilities in Ukraine, destroying key supplies needed by Ukrainian pharmacies. These actions come as US envoy Steve Witkoff prepares for further talks with Ukraine's president, aiming to address ongoing security and humanitarian issues.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions</h2>
<p>Israel conducted an airstrike in Gaza targeting Raed Saad, a senior commander in Hamas' Qassam Brigades. The strike was reported as deadly, contributing to ongoing violence in the region. In Syria, a gunman affiliated with IS attacked US military personnel, resulting in the deaths of two US soldiers and an interpreter, with three others injured. The assailant was subsequently killed by US forces. These incidents underscore the continuing tensions and conflict involving militant groups in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Southeast Asia Border Conflict</h2>
<p>Cambodia has closed several border crossings with Thailand amid continued fighting between the two countries. The closures persist despite statements from US President Donald Trump claiming that both sides had agreed to a ceasefire deal. The situation remains unstable, affecting cross-border movement and potentially impacting regional security.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Highlights</h2>
<p>In Virginia, authorities suspect a raccoon — dubbed the "trashed panda" — of breaking into a karate shop and a Department of Motor Vehicles office, stealing snacks and causing damage. This unusual story has drawn public attention for its quirky nature.</p>
<p>In India, an event featuring football star Lionel Messi, who plays for Inter Miami and the Argentina national team, faced disruption when angry fans threw chairs and bottles. Messi is currently touring several Indian cities, including Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, a street art festival has transformed Lagos into an "open-air gallery," introducing the city to vibrant street art. Known for its lively arts scene and nightlife, Lagos is embracing this new form of creative expression, which had been relatively rare until now.</p>
<h2>Political and Historical Images Released</h2>
<p>The House Oversight Committee in the United States has received new photographs from Jeffrey Epstein's estate. These images include figures such as Donald Trump, Andrew, and Bill Clinton. While the pictures have attracted attention, officials emphasize that the photos do not suggest any wrongdoing. The release adds to the public record related to Epstein's controversial history.</p>
