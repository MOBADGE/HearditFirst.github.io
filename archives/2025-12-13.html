    <h2>Ukraine Conflict Updates</h2>
<p>Donald Trump's envoy, Witkoff, is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders in Berlin to discuss the latest peace plan for the ongoing war in Ukraine. This meeting comes amid ongoing Russian attacks targeting Ukraine's medical supply chain. Over recent months, warehouses that supply the majority of Ukraine's pharmacies have been destroyed in a series of Russian strikes. These attacks severely impact Ukraine’s healthcare and add urgency to peace efforts.</p>
<h2>Southeast Asia Tensions</h2>
<p>Fighting continues between Thailand and Cambodia despite U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement that both countries have agreed to a ceasefire. The Thai Prime Minister clarified that a ceasefire could only happen after Cambodia fully withdraws its forces from contested areas. The situation remains fragile, with military clashes ongoing even as diplomatic efforts proceed.</p>
<h2>Central African Republic Conflict</h2>
<p>The peace accord known as the Washington Accord, recently praised by President Trump as "historic," has been undermined after rebels seized a key city in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). Despite hopes for lasting peace following the agreement, the fighting in DR Congo continues, posing significant challenges for stability in the region.</p>
<h2>U.S. Political and Legal News</h2>
<p>New photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate have been released to the House Oversight Committee. The images include figures such as Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton but do not imply any wrongdoing. These photos come as part of the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Epstein’s network.</p>
<p>In another legal development, prosecutors have presented extensive evidence including body camera footage and witness interviews in the case of Luigi Mangione. The hearing revealed new details about the events leading up to his arrest, although the full implications of this evidence remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>International Relations: Venezuela and Global Alignments</h2>
<p>U.S. President Trump is focusing on Venezuela, but experts report that traditional allies Russia and China are showing little support for the country. Analysts say military or financial aid from these powers has largely dried up, indicating a shift in Venezuela's international backing and potentially affecting its political and economic future.</p>
<h2>Human Interest</h2>
<p>A peculiar story from Virginia involves a raccoon suspected of breaking into a karate shop and stealing alcohol and snacks from a local Department of Motor Vehicles office. Dubbed the "trashed panda," the animal's unusual behavior has captured public attention for its mix of mischief and unexpected skill.</p>
<p>On a different note, WWE star John Cena is preparing for his final fight set for Saturday night. Known for his "You Can't See Me" catchphrase, Cena’s career has made him a legend in wrestling, notable not just for his athletic ability but also for his impact on the sport and its fans.</p>
