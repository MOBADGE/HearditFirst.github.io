    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine faces continued hardship as Russian forces launched overnight attacks targeting the country’s energy grid, leaving approximately one million households without power. These strikes come amid ongoing tensions and diplomatic efforts, with US envoy Steve Witkoff preparing for further discussions with Ukraine’s president. In addition to the energy infrastructure damage, Russia has been carrying out attacks on medical warehouses, destroying supplies vital to most of Ukraine’s pharmacies, which could severely impact healthcare services.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia, Cambodia has closed its border crossings with Thailand due to ongoing fighting, despite reports that US President Donald Trump announced both countries had agreed to a ceasefire deal. The situation remains volatile as tensions persist along the border.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy and Agreements</h2>
<p>In Africa, the recent peace agreement known as the Washington Accord for the Democratic Republic of Congo is under threat. Although US officials hailed the deal as a historic step toward ending conflict, violent clashes continue, with rebels seizing a key city in the region. The ongoing violence casts uncertainty over the future of peace efforts in the country.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, Belarus has released 123 prisoners, including opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, as part of a deal with the United States. This move coincided with the US lifting sanctions on Belarus, signaling a potential thaw in relations and a step towards political negotiations.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Highlights</h2>
<p>Several events are capturing public attention globally. Soccer star Lionel Messi, currently touring India and appearing in cities such as Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi, faced unrest when angry fans threw chairs and bottles at one of his events, highlighting tensions even in fan interactions.</p>
<p>In Nigeria’s largest city, Lagos, a street art festival is transforming the urban landscape into an "open-air gallery." While Lagos is known for its vibrant nightlife and creativity, street art has been relatively unknown until now, and this festival could help change that perception.</p>
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<p>In the world of entertainment, the wrestling legend John Cena is preparing for his final fight, marking the end of a notable career. Cena is widely recognized for his catchphrase "You Can't See Me" and has been a prominent figure in WWE. His farewell event is set for Saturday night, providing a moment for fans and the wrestling community to celebrate his contributions.</p>
<h2>Unusual Incidents</h2>
<p>A lighthearted yet curious story comes from Virginia, where a raccoon, dubbed the "trashed panda," is suspected of breaking into a karate shop and stealing snacks from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Authorities are investigating this unusual animal behavior that has captured public amusement.</p>
