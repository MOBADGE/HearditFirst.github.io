    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 13, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Conflicts</h2>
<p>Fighting continues between Thailand and Cambodia despite US President Donald Trump announcing an agreed ceasefire. The Thai Prime Minister clarified that a ceasefire could only happen after Cambodian forces fully withdrew from disputed areas. Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, violence persists after a recent peace deal described by Trump as "historic" was undermined when rebels seized a key city. These unresolved conflicts highlight ongoing challenges in achieving lasting peace in multiple regions.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Crisis and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Ukraine faces significant difficulties as Russian strikes have destroyed numerous medical warehouses, which supply most of the country’s pharmacies. This damages healthcare infrastructure amid ongoing conflict. In parallel diplomatic efforts, an envoy representing Trump is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders in Berlin to discuss the latest peace proposal. These developments reflect both the humanitarian impacts of the war and continued attempts to negotiate a resolution.</p>
<h2>US Political Figures in Epstein Estate Photos</h2>
<p>Newly released photographs from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, provided to the US House Oversight Committee, show President Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton. The images themselves do not imply any wrongdoing but are part of a broader investigation into Epstein’s network. The release has attracted attention due to the high-profile individuals pictured.</p>
<h2>Venezuela’s Waning International Support</h2>
<p>Efforts by Trump to apply pressure on Venezuela face complications as major allies Russia and China show minimal signs of military or financial assistance. Experts indicate that support from these countries for Venezuela has largely dried up, suggesting limited external backing for the Venezuelan government amid its ongoing crisis.</p>
<h2>Local Incidents and Miscellaneous News</h2>
<p>In Virginia, an unusual series of break-ins has been attributed to a drunk raccoon suspected of burglarising a karate shop and stealing snacks from a government office. Elsewhere, a house explosion in California caused by a natural gas leak injured six people and damaged nearby homes. These events, while local, add to a diverse day of news stories spanning from international affairs to community incidents.</p>
<h2>Sports Spotlight</h2>
<p>John Cena, known for his "You Can't See Me" catchphrase, prepares for his final wrestling match on Saturday night. Celebrated not only for his wrestling abilities but also for his personality and connection with fans, Cena’s last fight marks the end of a significant era in the sport.</p>
