    <h2>Ongoing Conflicts and Ceasefire Challenges</h2>
<p>Fighting continues in several conflict zones despite recent peace efforts. Cambodia has closed its border crossings with Thailand amid ongoing clashes, even though US President Donald Trump stated that both sides had agreed to a ceasefire deal. Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, rebels have seized a key city, undermining the "historic" peace accord recently brokered in Washington. These developments suggest that achieving lasting peace remains difficult in these regions.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Energy and Medical Supply Disruptions</h2>
<p>Ukraine is experiencing serious infrastructure attacks linked to the ongoing conflict with Russia. Overnight strikes have cut power to one million households by targeting the country’s energy grid. In addition, Russian strikes have destroyed warehouses that supply most of Ukraine’s pharmacies, causing significant damage to health supplies. These attacks come as US envoy Steve Witkoff prepares for more talks with Ukraine's president, highlighting continuing diplomatic efforts alongside military challenges.</p>
<h2>Prisoner Release and Sanctions Relief in Belarus</h2>
<p>Belarus has freed 123 prisoners as part of a new deal with the United States, which also involved lifting some sanctions. Among those released is opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova. This prisoner exchange marks a notable moment in Belarus-US relations and could indicate a potential thaw, though it remains to be seen whether this leads to broader changes in Belarus's political environment.</p>
<h2>Photos from Epstein Estate Show Prominent Figures</h2>
<p>The House Oversight Committee has received new photographs from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate. Among the images are pictures featuring Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton. Authorities have noted that the photos themselves do not imply any wrongdoing. The release adds to public records related to Epstein but has not led to new allegations as of now.</p>
<h2>Notable Cultural and Entertainment Events</h2>
<p>In lighter news, soccer star Lionel Messi’s tour in India faced disruption when angry fans threw chairs and bottles during an event. Messi is visiting cities including Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi as part of this tour. On a different note, professional wrestler John Cena is set to retire after a celebrated career, with his final fight scheduled for Saturday night. Fans are reflecting on his legacy as he prepares to bow out.</p>
<p>Additionally, in Virginia, an unusual incident involved a raccoon suspected of breaking into a karate equipment shop and stealing snacks from a government office. The animal’s antics have brought some unexpected humor amid more serious news stories.</p>
