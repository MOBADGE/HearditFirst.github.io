    <h2>Regional Conflict Updates</h2>
<p>Fighting continues in multiple global hotspots despite efforts toward ceasefire. Cambodia has closed border crossings with Thailand amid ongoing clashes, even after US President Donald Trump announced both sides had agreed to a ceasefire deal. Meanwhile, the peace deal hailed as "historic" by Trump for the Democratic Republic of Congo has faltered, with fighting resuming after rebels seized a key city. These developments underscore the challenges in resolving entrenched regional conflicts.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Under Attack</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing significant hardships due to recent Russian attacks. Overnight strikes on the country's energy grid have left one million households without power. At the same time, Russian forces have destroyed warehouses that supplied the majority of medicines to Ukraine’s pharmacies, further straining the nation’s healthcare system. These attacks come as US envoy Steve Witkoff prepares for additional talks with Ukraine’s president, signaling ongoing diplomatic efforts alongside the conflict.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal News in the US</h2>
<p>New photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate include images of Donald Trump, Andrew, and Bill Clinton. While the photos are part of materials reviewed by the US House Oversight Committee, they do not imply any wrongdoing. In legal news, evidence hearings involving Luigi Mangione featured body camera footage and witness testimonies from the day of his arrest. These legal proceedings continue to attract public and media attention.</p>
<h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Tensions are evident in Venezuela's international relations amid US attention. Although Donald Trump has targeted Venezuela, its traditional allies, Russia and China, have shown little support recently. Experts indicate that both countries’ backing has largely diminished, with no realistic prospects for military or financial assistance, pointing to a shift in global alliances and support networks.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Culture</h2>
<p>In lighter news, an unusual suspect—a drunk raccoon—has been linked to several break-ins in Virginia, including a karate shop and the Department of Motor Vehicles snack areas. Meanwhile, Argentine football star Lionel Messi faced hostility from angry fans who threw chairs and bottles at an event during his tour in India, which includes multiple cities such as Kolkata and Mumbai. Additionally, WWE legend John Cena is preparing for his final career fight, marking the end of an era for the popular figure known for his "You Can’t See Me" catchphrase.</p>
