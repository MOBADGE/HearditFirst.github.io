    <h2>Conflict and Diplomacy in Southeast Asia and Africa</h2>
<p>Fighting continues between Thailand and Cambodia despite US President Donald Trump's recent statement that the two countries agreed to a ceasefire. The Thai prime minister clarified that a ceasefire would only be possible once Cambodia had fully withdrawn its forces, indicating ongoing tensions on the border. Meanwhile, in Africa, a peace agreement known as the Washington Accord, which was called "historic" by Trump, has been undermined after rebels seized a key city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, continuing conflict in the region despite hopes of stability.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict and International Mediation Efforts</h2>
<p>The war in Ukraine remains intense as Russian strikes have destroyed warehouses supplying most of Ukraine's pharmacies, affecting medical supplies crucial for civilian and military needs. In efforts to bring about peace, Donald Trump's envoy, Scott Witkoff, is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders in Berlin to discuss the latest peace plan. These talks come amid ongoing violence and the urgent humanitarian situation created by the conflict.</p>
<h2>US Political Figures in Epstein Estate Photos</h2>
<p>New photographs from Jeffrey Epstein's estate have been released as part of materials received by the House Oversight Committee. The images include Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton. The release of these photos does not imply any wrongdoing but adds to the public record related to Epstein and his associations.</p>
<h2>US Domestic News: House Explosion in California and Unusual Raccoon Incidents in Virginia</h2>
<p>In California, a house explosion caused by a natural gas leak injured six people and damaged nearby properties. Emergency responders are managing the aftermath of the incident as investigations continue.</p>
<p>In a lighter, unusual story, a raccoon nicknamed the "trashed panda" has been suspected in several break-ins in Virginia, including burglarizing snacks from the Department of Motor Vehicles and causing damage at a karate shop. The incidents highlight quirky interactions between wildlife and urban environments.</p>
<h2>Venezuela's International Support Fades</h2>
<p>As Donald Trump targets Venezuela with renewed focus, experts note that key allies Russia and China show little sign of providing military or financial aid. This waning support suggests limited prospects for Venezuela to receive substantial international backing amid its ongoing challenges.</p>
