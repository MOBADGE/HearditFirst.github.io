    <h2>International Conflicts and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>Fighting between Thailand and Cambodia continues despite comments from Donald Trump suggesting the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire. The Thai prime minister clarified that a ceasefire could only happen after Cambodia fully withdrew its forces, indicating ongoing tensions.</p>
<p>In Central Africa, a peace agreement known as the Washington Accord, described as "historic" by Trump, is facing serious challenges. Recent rebel advances, including the seizure of a key city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, have undermined hopes for a lasting peace in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has sent an envoy, Witkoff, to Berlin to meet Ukraine's president and European leaders. The talks will focus on a new peace plan to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This diplomatic engagement comes as Russian strikes have targeted medical warehouses in Ukraine, destroying key supplies that support most of the country's pharmacies.</p>
<h2>Impact of Conflict on Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukraine has suffered significant damage to its health infrastructure. A series of Russian attacks on medical warehouses have destroyed storage facilities critical for supplying pharmacies across the country. The loss of these warehouses threatens the availability of medicines and medical supplies, compounding the humanitarian challenges caused by the war.</p>
<h2>Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>A collection of photographs from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate has been made public by the House Oversight Committee. The images include figures such as Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton. Importantly, these photos do not suggest any wrongdoing; they form part of the broader documentation obtained from Epstein's estate.</p>
<p>In the United States, prosecutors presented extensive body camera footage and witness testimonies during an evidence hearing related to Luigi Mangione's arrest. The hearing featured detailed accounts from the day of the incident, although specific charges or outcomes were not detailed.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Highlights</h2>
<p>In India, tensions arose at a public event featuring Lionel Messi during his "GOAT tour," where some fans reacted angrily by throwing chairs and bottles. Messi, currently playing for Inter Miami and the Argentina national team, is visiting several Indian cities, including Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and New Delhi as part of his tour.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, a raccoon in Virginia has been suspected of several unusual acts, including breaking into a karate shop and stealing snacks from a local Department of Motor Vehicles. This animal has been humorously nicknamed the "trashed panda" due to its behavior.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Spotlight</h2>
<p>John Cena, known for his wrestling catchphrase "You Can't See Me," is preparing for his final match, marking the end of a prominent career in professional wrestling. His farewell fight is scheduled for Saturday night, bringing attention to his legacy in the sport.</p>
