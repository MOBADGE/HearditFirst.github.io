    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>Middle East Conflict Escalations</h2>
<p>Israeli forces have conducted an airstrike in Gaza targeting Raed Saad, a senior commander in Hamas' Qassam Brigades. The strike killed Saad, marking another significant event in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Meanwhile, in Syria, a gunman affiliated with the Islamic State killed three Americans: two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter. This attack underlines the persistent security challenges in the region involving various militant groups.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Growing Infrastructure Damage</h2>
<p>Ukraine is grappling with the consequences of multiple Russian attacks on critical infrastructure. Overnight strikes on the country’s energy grid left about one million households without power, severely disrupting daily life. In addition, warehouses supplying most of Ukraine's pharmacies have been destroyed in recent Russian assaults, threatening the availability of essential health supplies amid ongoing conflict. These attacks come as US envoy Steve Witkoff prepares for further discussions with Ukraine’s president, seeking ways to address the crisis.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Developments in Belarus and US Relations</h2>
<p>Belarus has released 123 prisoners, including opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, as part of an agreement with the United States that led to the lifting of some US sanctions against Belarus. This exchange represents a rare diplomatic breakthrough amidst ongoing tensions between Belarus and Western countries. The release may signal a potential warming of relations or at least a strategic step towards dialogue between the two nations.</p>
<h2>Regional Tensions in Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Cambodia has closed several border crossings with Thailand amid ongoing fighting between the two countries. This shutdown came despite statements from US President Donald Trump indicating that both sides had agreed to a ceasefire deal. The border closures highlight that, despite diplomatic efforts, hostilities and security concerns remain unresolved on the ground.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Highlights</h2>
<p>In Lagos, Nigeria, a street art festival has transformed parts of the city into an "open-air gallery," promoting a relatively new art form in an area famous for its vibrant cultural scene. This festival aims to elevate street art and creativity, broadening Lagos’s reputation beyond nightlife and traditional arts.</p>
<p>In India, a public appearance by Lionel Messi at various events across Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi was marred by angry fans throwing chairs and bottles. The incident reflects the passionate and sometimes volatile reactions that public figures can face during high-profile tours.</p>
<p>Lastly, a lighter story comes from Virginia, where a raccoon dubbed the “trashed panda” is suspected of multiple break-ins, including a karate shop and a snack stall at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The unusual animal antics have caught media attention and add some levity to the day’s news.</p>
