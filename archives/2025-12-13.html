    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 13, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Belarus has released 123 prisoners, including opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, as part of a deal with the United States, which has lifted sanctions on the country. This move could signal a thaw in relations between Belarus and the US, potentially impacting broader geopolitical dynamics in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, conflict and violence continue in multiple areas. In Gaza, Israel targeted and killed Raed Saad, a senior commander in Hamas' Qassam Brigades, in a military strike. In Syria, two US soldiers and an interpreter were killed in an attack by an IS gunman; three other service members were injured, and the attacker was killed in the response. Fighting persists between Cambodia and Thailand, leading Cambodia to shut border crossings despite reports of a ceasefire agreement announced by US President Donald Trump.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict and Energy Crisis</h2>
<p>Ukraine is experiencing significant disruptions after overnight Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure left approximately one million households without power. These attacks add to ongoing challenges and follow a series of strikes that have also destroyed key medical supply warehouses, which support most of Ukraine’s pharmacies. The damage to health logistics could exacerbate difficulties for civilians and health facilities dependent on these supplies. The situation remains tense as US envoy Steve Witkoff prepares for further discussions with Ukraine’s president, highlighting ongoing international engagement.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, Lagos—the country’s largest city known for its nightlife and creativity—is hosting a street art festival that has transformed parts of the city into an open-air gallery. This event shines a light on an art form that has been relatively less known in the area, showcasing Lagos as a vibrant center for cultural expression.</p>
<h2>Unusual and Human Interest Stories</h2>
<p>In Virginia, authorities are investigating a raccoon believed to be responsible for breaking into a karate shop and a local Department of Motor Vehicles office, where it stole snacks and caused damage. Nicknamed the "trashed panda," the raccoon has attracted attention for its unusual behavior.</p>
<p>In India, an event featuring football star Lionel Messi faced disruptions when angry fans threw chairs and bottles. Messi, who plays for Inter Miami and the Argentina national team, is currently on a tour across Indian cities including Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi.</p>
<h2>Political and Public Figures</h2>
<p>New photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, shared with the US House Oversight Committee, show Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton. The release of these images does not imply wrongdoing but adds to public interest in the connections and associations of Epstein's network.</p>
