    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 13, 2025</div>
    <h2>Middle East Conflict Update</h2>
<p>Three Americans, including two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter, were killed in an attack by an Islamic State gunman in Syria, according to the US Central Command. Meanwhile, Israel conducted a strike in Gaza that killed Raed Saad, identified as a senior commander in Hamas' Qassam Brigades. These events underline ongoing violence and instability in the region, with potential implications for US foreign policy and regional security efforts.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Energy and Health Crisis</h2>
<p>Over one million households in Ukraine have lost power following overnight attacks on the country's energy grid attributed to Russia. This comes as US envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to continue talks with Ukraine's president, highlighting ongoing diplomatic efforts amid the conflict. Additionally, a series of Russian strikes have destroyed warehouses supplying most of Ukraine’s pharmacies, raising serious concerns about the availability of medical supplies and the public health situation.</p>
<h2>Belarus and US Reach Prisoner Exchange Deal</h2>
<p>Belarus has released 123 prisoners as part of a deal with the United States, which has subsequently lifted sanctions on the country. Among those freed is opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova. This development may signal a temporary easing of tensions between Belarus and the US, although it remains to be seen if this leads to further diplomatic engagement.</p>
<h2>Cambodia Closes Borders Amid Ongoing Fighting</h2>
<p>Cambodia has shut its border crossings with Thailand due to continued fighting, despite a reported ceasefire agreement that US President Donald Trump said both sides had agreed to. The closure reflects the fragile situation and ongoing conflict in the region, affecting cross-border movement and stability.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Unusual News</h2>
<p>In Lagos, Nigeria, a new street art festival has transformed parts of the city into an open-air gallery, showcasing creativity in a place better known for its vibrant arts scene and nightlife rather than street art. On a lighter note, a drunk raccoon in Virginia has gained attention for allegedly breaking into a karate shop and stealing snacks from a government office, bringing some humor amid more serious news. Additionally, angry fans disrupted an event featuring Lionel Messi in India by throwing chairs and bottles, highlighting challenges faced during his tour in cities including Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi.</p>
