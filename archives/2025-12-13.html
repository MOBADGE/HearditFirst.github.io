    <h2>Ongoing Conflict in Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Fighting continues between Thailand and Cambodia despite US President Donald Trump saying the countries agreed to a ceasefire. Thailand’s prime minister clarified that a ceasefire would only be possible after Cambodia withdraws all its forces from contested areas. The situation remains tense with no immediate resolution in sight.</p>
<h2>Ukraine War Developments</h2>
<p>Donald Trump’s envoy, Witkoff, is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders in Berlin to discuss a new peace plan for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian health supply warehouses, which support most of the country’s pharmacies, have been repeatedly targeted and destroyed in a series of Russian strikes. This has raised concerns about access to medical supplies amid the fighting.</p>
<h2>Peace Efforts in Africa Face Setbacks</h2>
<p>A recent peace agreement, called the Washington Accord, touted by Donald Trump as "historic," aimed to bring stability to the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, fighting continues after rebels seized a key city, undermining hopes for lasting peace in the region. This setback highlights ongoing instability despite diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Political and Social News Highlights</h2>
<p>New photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, shared with the House Oversight Committee, show Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Clinton together. These images do not imply any wrongdoing but add to the extensive documentation related to Epstein. In Venezuela, support from traditional allies Russia and China appears to be waning, with experts noting little chance of significant military or financial aid as the country faces pressure from the Trump administration.</p>
<h2>Local and Cultural Stories</h2>
<p>In Virginia, a raccoon suspected of being intoxicated has been blamed for breaking into a karate shop and stealing snacks from a Department of Motor Vehicles office. On the entertainment front, wrestler John Cena is preparing for his final fight, marking the end of a legendary career noted for his famous catchphrase "You Can't See Me."</p>
<h2>Public Safety Incident</h2>
<p>In California, a house explosion caused by a natural gas line leak injured six people and damaged nearby homes. Emergency services responded quickly to contain the incident and provide aid to those affected.</p>
