    <h2>Belarus Releases Prisoners as US Lifts Sanctions</h2>
<p>Belarus has freed 123 prisoners, including opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, as part of a deal with the United States. This development follows the US decision to lift sanctions on Belarus, signaling a potential thaw in relations. The release of political prisoners may impact the country's internal politics and its diplomatic ties moving forward.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Conflict in Ukraine and Impact on Civilians</h2>
<p>Ukraine faces significant challenges as Russian forces continue to target its infrastructure. Overnight attacks on the energy grid left one million households without power. In addition, Russian strikes have destroyed several medical warehouses that supply most of Ukraine's pharmacies, putting healthcare access under strain. Meanwhile, US envoy Steve Witkoff is preparing to resume talks with Ukraine's president, indicating ongoing diplomatic efforts amid the conflict.</p>
<h2>Violence and Security Incidents in the Middle East and Syria</h2>
<p>In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli military strike killed Raed Saad, identified as a senior commander in Hamas' Qassam Brigades. This operation is part of Israel's ongoing security actions against Hamas targets. Separately, in Syria, an attack by an IS gunman resulted in the deaths of two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter, according to US Central Command. These incidents highlight continuing instability and conflict in both regions.</p>
<h2>Cambodia-Thailand Border Closes Despite Ceasefire Announcement</h2>
<p>Cambodia has shut its border crossings with Thailand amid ongoing fighting between the two countries. This move comes despite a statement from US President Donald Trump that a ceasefire deal had been agreed upon by both sides. The border closure may affect regional security and cross-border movement, prolonging tensions in the area.</p>
<h2>Culture and Unusual News Highlights</h2>
<p>In India, an event featuring footballer Lionel Messi faced disruption when some fans threw chairs and bottles. Messi, who plays for Inter Miami and Argentina, is currently on a tour across several Indian cities including Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi. Meanwhile, in Virginia, authorities are investigating a raccoon suspected of breaking into a karate shop and stealing snacks from a Department of Motor Vehicles office, amusingly dubbed the "trashed panda."</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Lagos is hosting a street art festival that is transforming the city into an open-air gallery. Known for its vibrant arts scene and nightlife, Lagos is embracing street art as a growing cultural expression.</p>
<p>Additionally, new photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, received by the US House Oversight Committee, show former leaders including Donald Trump, Andrew, and Bill Clinton. The images do not suggest any wrongdoing but add to ongoing public interest in Epstein's connections.</p>
