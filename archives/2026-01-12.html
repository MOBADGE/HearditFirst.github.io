    <h2>International Tensions Over Iran Protests</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high as hundreds of people have died amid protests in Iran. The US president has indicated that Iranian leaders have reached out to negotiate, but he also warned that the US "may have to act" before any meeting takes place, suggesting the possibility of strong military measures. This situation highlights ongoing instability in the region and the potential for escalating conflict depending on how diplomacy and military options develop.</p>
<h2>US Justice Department Investigates Fed Chair</h2>
<p>A criminal investigation has been opened by the US Justice Department into Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Powell described the probe as "unprecedented." The investigation follows his refusal to reduce interest rates despite pressure from former US president Donald Trump. This probe raises questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and could have implications for US economic policy and governance.</p>
<h2>Golden Globes Spotlight Rising Stars</h2>
<p>The Golden Globes ceremony saw significant attention on the film "Marty Supreme" and its star Timothée Chalamet, who won a major award. His win adds momentum to his pursuit of an Oscar, one of the top honors in acting. Other notable winners included "One Battle After Another" and "Adolescence," which collectively marked the beginning of Hollywood's awards season. These results set the stage for upcoming major film awards and highlight emerging talent in the industry.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Australia</h2>
<p>Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, has blocked 550,000 accounts in response to a new Australian law that took effect in December. The law aims to protect children from online harm by restricting certain types of content and accounts. The large number of blocked accounts shows the significant impact of regulatory measures on social media platforms and ongoing efforts to increase online safety.</p>
<h2>Passing of Ai, the Notable Japanese Chimpanzee</h2>
<p>Ai, a chimpanzee known for her cognitive skills including counting and painting, has died at the age of 49. Since 1977, Ai was part of extensive studies at a Japanese research institute that explored animal intelligence. Her long life and the research conducted have contributed valuable knowledge to the understanding of primate cognition and the boundaries between human and animal intellectual abilities.</p>
