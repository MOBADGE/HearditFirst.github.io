    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 12, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions are rising as the US president discusses "very strong" military options in response to unrest in Iran, where hundreds have died in ongoing protests. While Iranian leaders have reportedly reached out to negotiate, the US indicates it might need to act before any diplomatic meetings take place. This situation remains fluid and could impact regional stability depending on how the US proceeds.</p>
<h2>US Political and Economic News</h2>
<p>The US Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This probe follows his decision not to lower interest rates despite pressure from former US president Donald Trump. Powell called the investigation "unprecedented," highlighting the unusual nature of this legal scrutiny into the central bank's policy decisions.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Highlights</h2>
<p>The Golden Globes took place with notable wins for Timothée Chalamet and the film Adolescence. Chalamet's triumph adds momentum to his Oscar campaign, reinforcing his growing prominence in Hollywood. Meanwhile, films like One Battle After Another also received recognition, marking the start of the awards season with a variety of celebrated performances and works.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Technology</h2>
<p>Meta has removed 550,000 accounts in Australia following a new law aimed at protecting children from online harm. This legislation, effective since December, requires social media platforms to take stronger measures against harmful content. Meta's action reflects growing regulatory pressure on tech companies to safeguard younger users online.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Travel Disruptions</h2>
<p>Severe cold weather in northern Finland has grounded all flights from Kittila airport, leaving thousands of tourists stranded. Temperatures plunged as low as -38°C, creating hazardous conditions that disrupted travel plans. The situation highlights challenges faced by travelers and local infrastructure during extreme winter weather.</p>
<h2>Culture and Science</h2>
<p>In music, Nigerian artists dominated the All Africa Music Awards, with Burna Boy winning Album of the Year for No Sign of Weakness, underscoring the global impact of African music. Additionally, the scientific community marked the passing of Ai, a Japanese chimpanzee known for her counting and painting abilities. Ai's extensive cognitive studies since 1977 contributed valuable insights into animal intelligence.</p>
