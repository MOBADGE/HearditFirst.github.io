    <h2>Iran Protests and Crackdown</h2>
<p>Eyewitnesses have described a violent crackdown on anti-government protests across Iran. Security forces reportedly attacked demonstrators, leading to widespread violence. According to a US-based human rights organization, more than 500 people have died during these protests. Among the victims were a referee and a student, highlighting the broad impact of the unrest. These events suggest continuing instability in Iran, with potential implications for regional security and human rights concerns.</p>
<h2>US-Venezuela Relations</h2>
<p>In Washington, political developments involving Venezuela continue to draw attention. Donald Trump is set to meet with Venezuelan opposition leader Machado at the White House. Machado won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize and had offered to share the accolade with Trump, an award he has long desired. Meanwhile, Ramón Guanipa, son of a jailed Venezuelan politician accused of treason related to the disputed 2024 presidential election, cautioned that Trump should not be fooled by promises of prisoner releases. These events reflect ongoing political tensions and efforts to navigate diplomatic relationships in the region.</p>
<h2>Federal Reserve Independence Under Scrutiny</h2>
<p>Three former chairs of the US Federal Reserve have publicly criticized a criminal investigation into current Fed chair Jerome Powell. They argue that the probe threatens the independence of the Federal Reserve and is inappropriate within the US context. Their statement underscores concerns about potential political interference in central banking, which could affect financial markets and economic policy stability.</p>
<h2>Extreme Weather Disrupts Travel in Finland</h2>
<p>Thousands of tourists have been stranded in Lapland, northern Finland, after all flights out of Kittila airport were cancelled due to severe cold. Temperatures in the region plunged as low as minus 38 degrees Celsius, forcing travel disruptions. The incident highlights the challenges posed by extreme weather conditions, particularly in remote northern areas popular with tourists.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulations in Australia</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms, has blocked 550,000 accounts in response to a new Australian law aimed at protecting children from online harm. This legislation, effective since December, requires social media companies to take greater responsibility for the content shared on their platforms. Meta’s actions indicate an evolving approach to balancing internet safety with access and expression.</p>
<h2>Remembering a 'Miracle Baby' from Mozambique</h2>
<p>Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the “miracle baby” born in a tree above floodwaters in Mozambique, has died at the age of 25. Her mother gave birth while sheltering in the tree during a flood event. Rosita's life story has drawn attention to the severe impacts of natural disasters on vulnerable communities and the resilience some demonstrate in the face of adversity.</p>
