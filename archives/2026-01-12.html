    <h2>Iran Protests and Crackdown</h2>
<p>Eyewitnesses have reported a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests across Iran. Security forces have been accused of repeatedly attacking demonstrators, with accounts describing ongoing violence. A US-based human rights group estimates that over 500 people, including a referee and a student, have been killed during these protests. The scale of the violence highlights the country's tense political situation and raises concerns about further unrest.</p>
<h2>White House Meeting on Venezuela</h2>
<p>Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado at the White House. Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, previously offered to share the award with Trump, an honor he values highly. This meeting may have implications for US-Venezuela relations, especially as Venezuela continues to face political challenges following a disputed 2024 presidential election.</p>
<h2>Federal Reserve Investigation Controversy</h2>
<p>Three former chairs of the US Federal Reserve have spoken out against a criminal investigation into current Fed chair Jerome Powell. They argue that the probe threatens the independence of the central bank and describe the investigation as inappropriate for the US context. The dispute signals tensions over monetary policy and governance of the nation's central financial institution.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Australia</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has blocked 550,000 accounts under a new Australian social media law aimed at protecting children from online harm. The legislation, which took effect in December, imposes stricter controls on content and user activity. Meta's response shows the growing impact of government regulation on global tech platforms and their efforts to comply with national laws.</p>
<h2>Extreme Weather Disrupts Travel in Finland</h2>
<p>Thousands of tourists were stranded in Lapland when all flights out of Kittila airport in northern Finland were canceled due to extreme cold, with temperatures dropping as low as -38°C. This weather event has caused significant travel disruptions during the winter season, underscoring challenges faced by northern communities and visitors in coping with severe cold spells.</p>
<h2>Remembering a 'Miracle Baby' from Mozambique</h2>
<p>Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the "miracle baby" born perched in a tree during devastating floods in Mozambique, has died at the age of 25. Her mother had sheltered for days above floodwaters before giving birth. Rosita’s story drew international attention as a symbol of resilience in the face of natural disaster.</p>
