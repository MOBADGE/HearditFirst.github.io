    <h2>Iran Protests and Crackdown</h2>
<p>Eyewitnesses have described a deadly crackdown on anti-government protesters across Iran, reporting that security forces have responded with lethal force. A US-based human rights group estimates that more than 500 people have been killed during these protests, including a referee and a student among the victims. The continuing violence highlights deep unrest and raises concerns about the government’s handling of dissent.</p>
<h2>US Political and Diplomatic News</h2>
<p>Donald Trump is set to meet Venezuelan opposition leader Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, at the White House. Machado offered to share the award with Trump, an accolade he has long desired. Meanwhile, the son of a jailed Venezuelan politician, Ramón Guanipa, cautioned that Trump should not be "fooled" by promises of prisoner releases amid tensions following Venezuela’s disputed 2024 presidential election.</p>
<h2>Federal Reserve Investigation Controversy</h2>
<p>Three former chairs of the US Federal Reserve have publicly criticized a criminal investigation into current Fed head Jerome Powell. They argue that the probe threatens the independence of the central bank and is inappropriate within the US political system. This development underscores ongoing debates about the balance between oversight and autonomy in financial governance.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Australia</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has blocked 550,000 accounts in response to a new Australian law that took effect in December. The legislation aims to protect children from harm online by restricting certain social media activity. Meta’s large-scale account removals reflect how social media platforms are adjusting to stricter regulatory environments.</p>
<h2>Extreme Weather Disrupts Travel in Finland</h2>
<p>Thousands of tourists have been stranded in Lapland, northern Finland, after all flights from Kittila airport were cancelled due to extreme cold, with temperatures plummeting as low as -38°C (-36°F). This severe weather has disrupted travel plans and highlights the challenges posed by harsh winter conditions in the region.</p>
<h2>Remembering a "Miracle Baby" from Mozambique</h2>
<p>Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the "miracle baby" born in a tree above floodwaters in Mozambique, has died at age 25. Her mother had taken shelter for several days during severe flooding before giving birth in this extraordinary circumstance. The story of Rosita has been a symbol of resilience amid natural disaster.</p>
