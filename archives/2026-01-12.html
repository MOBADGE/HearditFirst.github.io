    <h2>Middle East Unrest and U.S. Response</h2>
<p>More than 500 people have died amid ongoing protests in Iran, according to a US-based human rights organization. The demonstrations, which show widespread anti-government sentiment, have resulted in significant casualties, including a referee and a student. In response, the US president has said that Iranian leaders have reached out for negotiations but warned that the US "may have to act" before any dialogue takes place. The president also mentioned considering "very strong" military options, highlighting escalating tensions that could further destabilize the region.</p>
<h2>U.S. Federal Reserve and Political Tensions</h2>
<p>Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, has publicly criticized an investigation initiated by the US Justice Department. Powell suggested that the probe is unprecedented and is motivated by Donald Trump's anger over the Fed’s refusal to reduce interest rates. This public rebuke indicates a strained relationship between political figures and the central bank, which could have implications for ongoing economic policy and political discourse in the US.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in Switzerland</h2>
<p>The owner of a ski bar in Switzerland, Jacques Moretti, remains in custody following a deadly fire. Swiss media reports indicate that his detention has been extended amid concerns that he might attempt to flee. This case is under investigation as authorities continue to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Australia</h2>
<p>Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, has blocked 550,000 accounts in compliance with a new Australian social media law aimed at protecting children online. The regulation came into effect in December and is part of broader efforts to reduce online harm. This move marks a significant enforcement action and reflects increasing global scrutiny of social media platforms and their responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Travel Disruptions in Northern Europe</h2>
<p>Thousands of tourists are stranded in Lapland, northern Finland, after all flights from Kittila airport were canceled. The cancellations were due to extreme cold temperatures, which dropped as low as minus 38 degrees Celsius. The severe weather highlights challenges in travel and logistics in Arctic regions during winter, affecting both tourism and local economies.</p>
<h2>Other International News</h2>
<p>Hungary has granted asylum to a former justice minister from Poland, an action described as going against the spirit of European Union standards because it involves a citizen from another EU member state. In Ecuador, authorities discovered five decapitated heads on a beach in Puerto López, a town affected by gang violence. This grisly find underscores ongoing security challenges in that region. Meanwhile, the son of a jailed Venezuelan politician cautioned against trusting pledges of prisoner releases amid political disputes in Venezuela.</p>
