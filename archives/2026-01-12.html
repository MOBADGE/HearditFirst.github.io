    <h2>Middle East Unrest and US Response</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have turned deadly, with a US-based human rights group reporting that more than 500 people, including a referee and a student, have been killed during large-scale anti-government demonstrations. The unrest has drawn international attention as the US president indicated that Iranian leaders have reached out to negotiate. However, he also warned that the US "may have to act" militarily before any meeting takes place, citing "very strong" options being considered. This escalation highlights tensions between the two countries and leaves uncertainty about potential further actions.</p>
<h2>US Central Bank Investigation Draws Criticism</h2>
<p>In the United States, three former chairs of the Federal Reserve have spoken out against a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell, the current head of the central bank. They argue that the probe threatens the Fed's independence and that such investigations have "no place" in the country’s political landscape. The criticism from these former officials signals concerns about maintaining the autonomy of key financial institutions amid ongoing political pressures.</p>
<h2>Australian Social Media Regulation Takes Effect</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has taken action in response to a new Australian law aimed at protecting children from online harm. Since the law came into effect in December, Meta has blocked 550,000 accounts as part of efforts to comply with the social media ban introduced by the Australian government. The move reflects increased global attention to online safety and the responsibilities of social media platforms to regulate harmful content.</p>
<h2>Travel Disruptions in Finland Due to Extreme Cold</h2>
<p>Thousands of tourists were stranded in Lapland, northern Finland, after all flights from Kittila airport were cancelled amid severe cold weather. Temperatures dropped as low as -38°C, forcing the airport to ground flights on Sunday. This situation underscores the challenges that extreme weather poses to transportation and travel in Arctic regions, especially during the winter tourist season.</p>
<h2>European Asylum Controversy</h2>
<p>Hungary has granted asylum to a former Polish justice minister, a move that has raised eyebrows given the countries' shared membership in the European Union. This decision is seen as conflicting with the spirit of EU standards, which typically promote cooperation and shared policies among member states. The asylum case adds to ongoing debates about political asylum practices and EU unity.</p>
<h2>Remembering a "Miracle Baby" from Mozambique</h2>
<p>Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the "miracle baby" for being born in a tree sheltering from floodwaters in Mozambique, has died at the age of 25. Her mother had given birth while perched above dangerous floodwaters during a natural disaster that displaced many people. Rosita’s story had previously captured global attention as a symbol of resilience amid hardship.</p>
