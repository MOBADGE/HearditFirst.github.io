    <h2>International Tensions: US Considers Military Options in Iran</h2>
<p>The US president has indicated that the United States is considering "very strong" military options amid ongoing deadly protests in Iran, where hundreds have been killed. While Iranian leaders have reached out to negotiate, the president suggested that action might be necessary before any formal meeting takes place. This development underscores rising tensions between the two countries and the potential for heightened conflict depending on how negotiations and events on the ground unfold.</p>
<h2>US Justice Department Investigates Federal Reserve Chair</h2>
<p>The US Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Powell described this probe as "unprecedented," notably following his decision not to reduce interest rates despite pressure from President Donald Trump. This investigation highlights the scrutiny faced by Powell in his role managing US monetary policy and could have broader implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<h2>Golden Globes: Timothée Chalamet Wins Big</h2>
<p>At this year's Golden Globe Awards, Timothée Chalamet stood out as a major winner, including for his performance in the film "Marty Supreme." His success at the Globes boosts his chances in the upcoming Oscar season. Other films such as "One Battle After Another" and "Adolescence" also received accolades, signaling the start of what promises to be a competitive Hollywood awards season.</p>
<h2>Meta Enforces New Australian Social Media Law</h2>
<p>Meta has taken significant steps to comply with a new Australian law aimed at protecting children from online harm. Since the law came into effect in December, the company has blocked 550,000 user accounts in Australia. This action reflects increasing regulatory efforts to make social media platforms safer for younger users and may signal further changes in how tech companies manage content in different countries.</p>
<h2>Scientific Milestone: Death of Ai, the Cognitively Gifted Chimpanzee</h2>
<p>Ai, a chimpanzee known for her remarkable cognitive skills including counting and painting, has died at the age of 49. Ai had been studied extensively since 1977 at a Japanese research institute, contributing valuable insights into animal intelligence and cognition. Her passing marks the end of a significant chapter in primate research.</p>
