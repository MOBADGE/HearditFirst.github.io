    <h2>Iran Protests and Crackdown</h2>
<p>Eyewitnesses have described ongoing violent crackdowns by security forces on anti-government protests across Iran. The protests, which have lasted several months, have turned deadly, with a US-based human rights group reporting that more than 500 people have been killed, including a referee and a student among the victims. Witnesses told the BBC that security personnel continued firing on demonstrators, illustrating a brutal attempt to suppress dissent. This crackdown is likely to increase international concern and could lead to further pressure on the Iranian government.</p>
<h2>US Political Developments and International Relations</h2>
<p>Former chairs of the US Federal Reserve have publicly condemned a criminal investigation targeting Jerome Powell, current chair of the Fed, arguing that the probe threatens the central bank’s independence and is inappropriate in the American context. Meanwhile, former US president Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Venezuelan opposition leader Machado at the White House. Machado, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, has offered to share the honor with Trump. This meeting highlights ongoing US engagement with Venezuelan political figures amid a complex political situation, where jailed opposition figures and disputed election results remain controversial.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Australia</h2>
<p>Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, has blocked 550,000 accounts following Australia's new social media law that came into effect in December. This legislation aims to protect children from online harm by enforcing stricter content moderation rules. The large number of account removals shows the immediate impact of the law on social media platforms operating in Australia, raising questions about online safety and freedom of expression as governments increase regulatory measures.</p>
<h2>Weather Disruptions in Finland</h2>
<p>Thousands of tourists were stranded in Lapland, northern Finland, after the cancellation of all flights from Kittila airport due to extreme cold weather. Temperatures dropped as low as -38°C, creating hazardous conditions that forced travel disruptions. This situation highlights the challenges of maintaining transportation services during severe winter weather, especially in Arctic or near-Arctic regions, and may affect tourism and local economies in the short term.</p>
<h2>Notable Human Interest and Legal News</h2>
<p>In a touching human interest story, Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as a "miracle baby," who was born in a tree above floodwaters in Mozambique 25 years ago, passed away recently. Her birth took place while her mother was sheltering from severe flooding, making her story remarkable. On the legal front in Switzerland, Jacques Moretti, owner of a ski bar linked to a deadly fire, has had his custody extended amid concerns that he may be a flight risk, as reported by Swiss media. This case remains under investigation.</p>
