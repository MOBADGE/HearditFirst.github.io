    <h2>Middle East Tensions</h2>
<p>The US president has indicated that the United States is considering "very strong" military options in response to the ongoing unrest in Iran, where hundreds of protesters have been killed. While Iranian leaders have reached out to negotiate, the US leader warned that action "may have to" be taken before any meeting occurs. This development marks an escalation amid the protests and raises concerns about potential regional instability.</p>
<h2>US Justice Department Investigation</h2>
<p>The US Justice Department has opened a criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The investigation follows Powell's refusal to lower interest rates despite pressure from President Donald Trump. Powell described the probe as "unprecedented," highlighting tensions between political leadership and economic policy decision-makers during his tenure.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Highlights: Golden Globes</h2>
<p>At the recent Golden Globes, Timothée Chalamet won significant recognition for his role in "The Marty Supreme," boosting his chances in the ongoing awards season. Other winners included "One Battle After Another" and "Adolescence," which also received multiple accolades. These results set the tone for the upcoming Oscars and signal the strong contenders in this year’s film awards.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Australia</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has blocked 550,000 accounts in response to a new Australian law aimed at protecting children from online harm. The legislation, effective since December, requires social media platforms to take stronger measures to restrict harmful content. Meta's large-scale account blocking demonstrates the law's broad impact on online platforms operating in Australia.</p>
<h2>Severe Weather in Finland</h2>
<p>Thousands of tourists are stranded in Lapland after flights out of Kittila airport were canceled due to extreme cold temperatures dropping as low as -38°C. The severe weather has disrupted travel plans in northern Finland, illustrating how harsh winter conditions continue to affect the region’s accessibility and tourism industry.</p>
<h2>Notable Passings: Japanese Chimpanzee Ai</h2>
<p>Ai, a Japanese chimpanzee known for her advanced cognitive abilities including counting and painting, passed away at the age of 49. Brought to a Japanese research institute in 1977, Ai's intelligence had been studied extensively, contributing valuable insights into primate cognition over several decades.</p>
