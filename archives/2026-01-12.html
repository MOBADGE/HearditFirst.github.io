    <h2>Iran Faces Intense Crackdown on Protests</h2>
<p>Eyewitnesses have described a violent response by security forces against anti-government protesters across Iran. The BBC reports that authorities have launched a ferocious crackdown, involving deadly force, as the country faces widespread demonstrations. The rulers are also imposing near-total internet shutdowns to restrict communications and limit the spread of information. This unrest marks the most significant challenge to the Iranian authorities since the 1979 revolution. The situation remains fluid, with concerns about ongoing violence and restrictions on public expression.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Venezuela and U.S. Engagement</h2>
<p>In the United States, President Donald Trump is set to meet with Venezuelan opposition leader Machado at the White House. Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, had offered to share the honour with Trump, a prize he has long desired. Meanwhile, tensions persist in Venezuela where Ramón Guanipa, son of a jailed politician accused of treason after contesting the 2024 presidential election outcome, warned that Trump should not be misled by promises of prisoner releases. These developments highlight ongoing political complexities involving Venezuela and U.S. relations.</p>
<h2>Concerns Over U.S. Federal Reserve Investigation</h2>
<p>Three former chairs of the U.S. Federal Reserve have publicly condemned a criminal investigation into current Fed leader Jerome Powell. They argue that the probe threatens the independence of the central bank and assert that such actions "have no place" in the United States. The criticism from these former officials underlines worries about potential political interference in the Federal Reserve’s operations, which could have broader implications for U.S. economic policy and stability.</p>
<h2>Tragic Passing of 'Miracle Baby' in Mozambique</h2>
<p>Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, famously known as the "miracle baby" born in a tree above floodwaters in Mozambique, has died at the age of 25. Her birth was remarkable because her mother sheltered in a tree for days during severe flooding before giving birth. The story of her survival became widely known and symbolized resilience amid disaster. Her passing reminds communities of the ongoing challenges posed by natural disasters in vulnerable regions.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation and Travel Disruptions</h2>
<p>Australia's new social media law targeting online harm to children is having immediate effects, with Meta blocking 550,000 accounts as part of the enforcement efforts. The legislation, effective since December, represents a significant step toward regulating content on major platforms.</p>
<p>In northern Finland, thousands of tourists were stranded after all flights from Kittila airport were cancelled due to extreme cold, with temperatures plunging to -38°C. This disruption underscores the challenges posed by severe weather in popular travel destinations.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, Jacques Moretti, owner of a ski bar linked to a deadly fire, has had his custody extended amid concerns he might flee. Meanwhile, Hungary has granted asylum to a former Polish justice minister, a move seen as controversial because it goes against typical European Union standards emphasizing solidarity among member states.</p>

<p>This roundup covers key international issues from political unrest and diplomacy to social policy and human interest stories around the world.</p>
