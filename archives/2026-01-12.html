    <h2>Iran Protests and Crackdown</h2>
<p>Eyewitnesses have described a severe crackdown by security forces against anti-government protesters across Iran. Reports indicate that the violence has been widespread and deadly. A US-based human rights group states that over 500 people have died during the protests. Among the victims are individuals including a referee and a student, highlighting the broad impact across Iranian society. The ongoing unrest and heavy-handed response underscore deep tensions within the country and raise concerns about future stability.</p>
<h2>US-Venezuela Political Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Venezuelan opposition leader Machado at the White House. Machado won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize and had offered to share the prize with Trump, who has long sought the recognition. Meanwhile, the son of a jailed Venezuelan politician, Ramón Guanipa, warned Trump not to be misled by pledges of prisoner releases made by Venezuelan authorities. Guanipa's father faces accusations of treason related to the contested 2024 presidential election, indicating ongoing political strife in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Central Bank Investigation Controversy</h2>
<p>A criminal investigation into Jerome Powell, the current head of the US Federal Reserve, has drawn sharp criticism from three former Fed chairs. They argue that the probe threatens the independence of the central bank and has no appropriate place in the US political or judicial system. These comments reflect concerns about maintaining the Fed’s autonomy in managing monetary policy free from political interference.</p>
<h2>Australian Social Media Regulation</h2>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has blocked 550,000 accounts in response to a new Australian law that took effect in December. The legislation aims to protect children from online harm by imposing stricter rules on social media companies. Meta’s wide-scale account removals show the significant impact of the law on platform operations and efforts to improve online safety.</p>
<h2>Extreme Weather and Travel Disruptions in Finland</h2>
<p>Severe cold weather in northern Finland has caused considerable travel problems, with temperatures dropping as low as -38°C. All flights departing from Kittila airport in Lapland were canceled on Sunday, stranding thousands of tourists unable to leave the region. The extreme cold and flight cancellations highlight the challenges of managing transportation in the face of harsh winter conditions.</p>
<h2>In Memoriam: "Miracle Baby" from Mozambique</h2>
<p>Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the "miracle baby" for being born in a tree above floodwaters in Mozambique 25 years ago, has passed away. Her mother had sheltered in the tree for days before giving birth during a severe flood. Rosita's story symbolized hope and survival amid natural disaster, drawing international attention at the time.</p>
