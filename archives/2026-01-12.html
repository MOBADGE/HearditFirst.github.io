    <h2>Middle East Unrest and US Response</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have turned deadly, with a US-based human rights group reporting that more than 500 people have died during recent anti-government demonstrations. The unrest reflects ongoing tensions within the country. The US president acknowledged calls from Iranian leaders to negotiate but indicated that military action remains a possibility and said the US "may have to act" before any planned meetings. This development raises concerns about further escalation in the region and signals heightened US involvement.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Issues: Federal Reserve and Legal Investigations</h2>
<p>Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, publicly criticized an "unprecedented" investigation by the US Justice Department. Powell suggested the probe might be linked to President Donald Trump's dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve's decision not to cut interest rates. This situation highlights tensions between political leaders and financial regulators, and it could impact public confidence in both the Fed's independence and the conduct of legal inquiries.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Jacques Moretti, owner of a Swiss ski bar, has had his custody extended amid investigations into a recent deadly fire linked to his establishment. Swiss media reports say he is being held as a potential flight risk. This case is under close scrutiny as authorities continue to probe the circumstances of the fire and any possible accountability.</p>
<h2>International Political Developments</h2>
<p>In international news, Hungary has granted asylum to a former Polish justice minister. This move is notable because it involves granting protection to a citizen of another European Union member state, a decision viewed as contrary to the EU's principles of cooperation between member countries. Separately, the son of a jailed Venezuelan politician warned former US president Donald Trump against being deceived by promises of prisoner releases. His father was detained and accused of treason following disputes around the 2024 Venezuelan election.</p>
<h2>Additional Updates</h2>
<p>- Social media company Meta has blocked 550,000 accounts in Australia following the country's new law aimed at protecting children from online harm. The law took effect in December, and this enforcement reflects ongoing efforts to regulate online content.</p>
<p>- Thousands of tourists remain stranded in Lapland, Finland, after flights were grounded due to extreme cold temperatures dropping to -38C. All flights from Kittila airport were cancelled, disrupting travel plans in the region.</p>
<p>- In Ecuador, decapitated heads were found on a beach in Puerto López, a town experiencing significant gang violence. This shocking discovery underscores ongoing security challenges there.</p>
<p>- In entertainment, actor Timothée Chalamet won big at the Golden Globes for his performance in "Marty Supreme," beating more established stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, boosting his prospects for the upcoming Academy Awards.</p>
