    <h2>Unrest and Violence in Iran</h2>
<p>Eyewitnesses have described violent crackdowns by security forces on anti-government protests across Iran. Reports detail that the forces "just kept killing" protesters, leading to a significant number of casualties. A U.S.-based human rights group estimates that more than 500 people, including a referee and a student, have died amid the protests. The scale of the violence underscores the heightened tensions between the government and citizens demanding change, and it raises international concerns about human rights and political stability in the country.</p>
<h2>Financial Independence Under Threat in the US</h2>
<p>Three former chairs of the Federal Reserve have publicly condemned a criminal investigation into current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. They argue that the investigation threatens the independence of the central bank and assert that such inquiries have "no place" in the United States. Their statement highlights ongoing concerns about the politicization of financial institutions and the potential implications for economic policy and market confidence if the Fed's autonomy is undermined.</p>
<h2>Natural Disaster Story: 'Miracle Baby' Passes Away</h2>
<p>Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the "miracle baby" for being born while her mother was sheltering in a tree above floodwaters in Mozambique, has died at the age of 25. Her birth was a remarkable event during a severe flood that forced her family into extraordinary circumstances to survive. This story has drawn attention to the ongoing challenges faced by communities affected by natural disasters and the resilience of those enduring extreme conditions.</p>
<h2>Social Media Regulation in Australia</h2>
<p>Meta has blocked 550,000 accounts following the implementation of Australia's new social media law aimed at protecting children from online harm. The law came into effect in December and marks a significant regulatory move to increase online safety. The large number of account blocks reflects the continuing effort by platforms and governments to tackle harmful content and protect vulnerable users on social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Extreme Cold Disrupts Travel in Finland</h2>
<p>Thousands of tourists are stranded in Lapland due to the cancellation of all flights out of Kittila airport in northern Finland. The region is experiencing extreme cold, with temperatures dropping as low as -38°C (-36°F). This severe weather has caused travel disruptions during a popular tourist season, highlighting the challenges posed by harsh winter conditions in northern climates and the potential impact on local economies dependent on tourism.</p>
<h2>Political Asylum Within the EU</h2>
<p>Hungary has granted asylum to a former Polish justice minister, a move that goes against the spirit of European Union standards given that both countries are members of the EU. This unusual asylum decision may signal political tensions or differences within the EU and could have implications for intra-European cooperation and judicial matters. The case draws attention to ongoing political complexities among EU member states.</p>
