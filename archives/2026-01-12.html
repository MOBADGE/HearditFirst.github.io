    <h2>Middle East Unrest</h2>
<p>Eyewitnesses have reported that security forces in Iran are violently suppressing anti-government protests that have now continued for three weeks. The crackdown has been described as "ferocious," with widespread attacks on demonstrators across the country. Authorities have also imposed a near total internet shutdown to limit communication and control the narrative about the unrest. These protests represent one of the most significant challenges to Iran’s rulers since the 1979 revolution, raising questions about the country’s political stability moving forward.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Economic Actions</h2>
<p>In response to the turmoil in Iran, Trump announced a new 25% tariff targeting countries that maintain business relations with Iran. He stated that the tariff is "effective immediately," signaling a strong economic pressure tactic aimed at curbing support for the Iranian government amid ongoing protests. This move could increase tensions between the US and other nations involved in trade with Iran and may further complicate international diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>Trump is scheduled to meet with Venezuelan opposition leader Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025. Machado has offered to share her Nobel recognition with Trump, an award the former president has expressed interest in. Meanwhile, concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence have surfaced after a criminal investigation was opened into Jerome Powell. Three former Fed chairs criticized this probe, describing it as an attempt to undermine the central bank and stating such investigations have no place in US governance.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Mozambique, Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the "miracle baby" for being born in a tree during devastating floodwaters, has died at the age of 25. Her birth story was remarkable due to the extreme conditions her mother endured. On a different front, Meta has blocked 550,000 accounts in Australia following the implementation of a new law aimed at protecting children from online harm. This social media ban took effect in December and reflects growing concerns about internet safety for minors.</p>
<h2>Travel and Safety</h2>
<p>Extreme cold weather in northern Finland has led to the cancellation of all flights out of Kittila airport, stranding thousands of tourists in the region. Temperatures have dropped as low as -38°C, making travel conditions hazardous. Separately, in Switzerland, the owner of a ski bar linked to a deadly fire, Jacques Moretti, has had his custody extended amid concerns he might flee. Authorities continue their investigation into the incident.</p>
