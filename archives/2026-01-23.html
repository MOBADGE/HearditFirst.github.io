    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has made a controversial claim that NATO troops stayed "a little off the front lines" during the Afghanistan conflict. This remark has sparked outrage in the UK, where 457 military personnel died in the conflict. The discussion highlights ongoing tensions over nations’ roles and sacrifices in Afghanistan. In a related development, Trump has also withdrawn Canada's invitation to the Board of Peace without providing a reason. This decision follows remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warning of a "rupture" in the US-led global order.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Yemen</h2>
<p>The BBC has reported on secret prisons run by the United Arab Emirates in Yemen. Former detainees describe being abused at sites located on former UAE military bases in Yemen. This investigation draws attention to human rights violations amid the ongoing conflict in the region, raising questions about accountability and the treatment of prisoners.</p>
<h2>Severe Winter Storm Warning in the US</h2>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a warning of an "extremely dangerous" winter storm hitting parts of the United States. Officials warn the storm will bring life-threatening conditions, including a high risk of hypothermia. Communities are urged to prepare for hazardous weather and take necessary safety precautions as the storm approaches.</p>
<h2>Tragedy in Pakistan</h2>
<p>The death toll from a fire at Gul Plaza mall in Karachi, Pakistan, has risen to 67. Authorities continue the process of identifying bodies recovered from the wreckage. This incident underscores ongoing concerns about building safety and emergency response in the country.</p>
<h2>Security and Violence in Nigeria</h2>
<p>Following an attack on three churches in a Nigerian village, approximately 160 people are reported missing. One victim described the harrowing experience, noting the violence and chaos during the abduction. This attack highlights persistent security challenges faced by communities in the region.</p>
<h2>Cultural Heritage and Legal Disputes</h2>
<p>A court ruling has granted the family of Nelson Mandela the right to sell some of his personal items, including his prison key, sunglasses, and shirt. Authorities had tried to block their export, arguing these items were part of South Africa's national heritage. The ruling marks a significant moment in the debate over the ownership and handling of historical artifacts.</p>
