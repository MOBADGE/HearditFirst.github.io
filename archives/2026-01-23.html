    <h2>International Relations and Conflict</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has drawn criticism in the UK after claiming that NATO troops remained "a little off the front lines" during the Afghanistan conflict. His statement comes despite the fact that 457 British military personnel died in the war. Meanwhile, Trump is also actively pushing for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine amid ongoing tensions. However, key issues between the two countries remain unresolved, and experts have expressed low expectations for the upcoming talks. In a related development, the Taliban released Khadija Ahmadzada, a 22-year-old female athlete, who had been detained for violating rules on women's sports gyms.</p>
<h2>Security and Human Rights</h2>
<p>The BBC has reported on secret detention sites run by the United Arab Emirates in Yemen, where detainees have described cases of abuse. The reports highlight ongoing concerns about human rights violations linked to these bases. In South Sudan, the army chief has issued an ultimatum to soldiers to suppress a rebellion within seven days. Reinforcements have been sent to the town of Bor, a key location on the route to the capital, Juba.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Public Safety</h2>
<p>The US National Weather Service has issued a warning about an "extremely dangerous" winter storm. The agency emphasized that the storm could create life-threatening risks due to hypothermia. Residents in affected areas are being urged to take precautions as the storm approaches.</p>
<h2>Domestic Tragedy in Pakistan</h2>
<p>The death toll in a fire at the Gul Plaza mall in Karachi, Pakistan, has risen to 67. Recovery efforts continue as teams work to identify bodies from the wreckage. This tragedy highlights ongoing concerns about safety standards in commercial buildings.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic and Heritage Issues</h2>
<p>In diplomatic news, President Trump has withdrawn Canada’s invitation to join the Board of Peace without providing a reason. This move follows comments by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warning about a potential "rupture" in the US-led global order. Separately, a court ruling has allowed the daughter of Nelson Mandela to sell some of his belongings—including his prison key, sunglasses, and shirt—despite attempts by authorities to prevent their export on grounds of national heritage.</p>
<h2>Trade and Sanctions</h2>
<p>An analysis has found that since January 11, about 42 Russian tankers subject to sanctions have passed through the English Channel despite UK authorities pledging "assertive" action against such vessels. This raises questions about the enforcement of sanctions in the region.</p>
