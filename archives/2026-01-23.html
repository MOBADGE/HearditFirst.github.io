    <h2>Entertainment: Oscar Nominations Bring Surprises</h2>
<p>The latest Oscar nominations revealed some unexpected developments. Notably, actors Paul Mescal and Chase Infiniti were excluded from the list, despite their prominence. Meanwhile, several other actors were recognized and helped secure nominations for their films. These results highlight shifting recognition trends in the film industry and suggest that upcoming awards season could feature some fresh faces and performances.</p>
<h2>International Security: Controversy Over NATO's Role in Afghanistan</h2>
<p>The US president recently stated that allied troops "stayed a little back" during the Afghanistan conflict. This comment drew a response from a government minister who described the claim as disappointing. The remarks reflect ongoing debates about the roles and contributions of international forces in the war, a sensitive topic given the conflict’s long and complex history.</p>
<h2>Nigeria: Church Abduction Leaves Many Missing</h2>
<p>A violent raid on three churches in a Nigerian village on Sunday has left around 160 people missing. One victim, describing the escape, mentioned that "blood was all over," painting a grim picture of the attack. The incident adds to concerns about security and the safety of civilians in the region, emphasizing the need for increased protective measures and swift investigations.</p>
<h2>Diplomacy: Trump Withdraws Canada's Invitation to Peace Forum</h2>
<p>The US president recently revoked Canada’s invitation to participate in an event called the "Board of Peace." No official reason was provided for this decision. This move comes shortly after Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed worries about a possible "rupture" in the US-led global order. The situation points to potential strains in international relations and may affect future collaborations on global peace initiatives.</p>
<h2>Technology: TikTok’s New US Arrangement and Its Implications</h2>
<p>TikTok has finalized a deal to continue its American operations by creating a new US-based entity distinct from its global business. This arrangement aims to address regulatory concerns and keep the app accessible to American users. However, the BBC’s Asia Business Correspondent notes that this split might impact TikTok’s broader global ambitions and how it manages its international markets moving forward.</p>
<h2>Culture: New Charity Album Features Top Artists</h2>
<p>A new charity album titled Help 2 is bringing together a range of well-known artists, including Olivia Rodrigo, Arctic Monkeys, and Pulp. The album supports the War Child organisation, which aids children affected by conflict worldwide. With fresh songs from these stars, the project aims to raise awareness and funds, demonstrating the continuing role of music in championing important causes.</p>
