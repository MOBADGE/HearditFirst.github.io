    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has sparked controversy in the UK by claiming that NATO troops stayed "a little off the front lines" during the Afghanistan conflict. This remark has drawn outrage, especially in light of the 457 UK military deaths recorded in the war. In related diplomatic developments, Trump has withdrawn an invitation to Canada to join a US-led Board of Peace. The decision followed comments from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warning of a "rupture" in the current international order led by the US.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Security</h2>
<p>Reports have emerged from Yemen revealing the use of secret prisons run by the United Arab Emirates on former UAE military bases. Detainees allege they suffered abuse at these sites. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, a violent raid on three churches in a village has left around 160 people missing. A survivor described the scene as covered in blood amid the chaos. These incidents highlight ongoing humanitarian and security challenges in both countries.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Crime</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck in Karachi, Pakistan, where a fire at Gul Plaza mall has claimed at least 67 lives. Efforts to identify victims of the disaster continue amid investigations. In India, authorities are probing the killing of hundreds of stray dogs in one state. Police confirmed at least 354 deaths and have arrested nine suspects, though the reasons behind this large-scale culling remain under review.</p>
<h2>International Sanctions Enforcement</h2>
<p>A BBC analysis has found that 42 Russian oil tankers, subject to international sanctions, have successfully navigated the English Channel since January 11, despite the UK's pledge to take assertive measures. The movement of these vessels raises questions about the effectiveness of sanctions enforcement and the challenges of monitoring maritime trade routes in tension-filled geopolitical contexts.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business</h2>
<p>The US-TikTok deal signals a new phase for Chinese technology companies operating globally. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, faces significant challenges tied to this agreement, reflecting broader issues for Chinese tech firms striving to expand internationally amid regulatory and political scrutiny. The deal’s outcomes could reshape the landscape for Chinese digital businesses looking to maintain or grow their presence in the US market.</p>
