    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 23, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump sparked outrage in the UK by claiming that NATO troops stayed "a little off the front lines" in Afghanistan, despite the loss of 457 UK military personnel during the conflict. This comment has drawn criticism given the sacrifices made by British forces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, talks involving Ukraine, Russia, and the US see Trump pushing hard for a peace deal. Nevertheless, major issues remain unresolved between Russia and Ukraine, leading to cautious expectations about the outcome of these negotiations.</p>
<p>In another development, Trump withdrew Canada’s invitation to join the Board of Peace, without providing a specific reason. This follows recent warnings from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about potential ruptures in the US-led global order.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict Zones</h2>
<p>Reports from Yemen reveal secret prisons run by the United Arab Emirates on former UAE military bases, where detainees have alleged abuse. Families of the detainees describe long periods of silence, with one parent stating they had not heard from their son for seven months.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban released Khadija Ahmadzada, a 22-year-old female athlete who had been detained for 13 days for violating rules related to women's sports gyms. This release comes amid ongoing concerns about restrictions on women's activities under Taliban rule.</p>
<p>Nigeria faces ongoing security challenges after attackers raided three churches in a village, leaving some 160 people missing. A survivor described a chaotic escape amid violence and bloodshed.</p>
<h2>Regional News</h2>
<p>Pakistan continues to mourn after a deadly fire at the Gul Plaza mall in Karachi. The death toll has risen to 67 as authorities work to identify the recovered bodies from the wreckage. The tragedy has prompted calls for better safety measures in public spaces.</p>
<h2>Weather and Environment</h2>
<p>The United States is bracing for an "extremely dangerous" winter storm. The National Weather Service has warned that the storm poses a life-threatening risk of hypothermia, signaling potentially severe impacts over the coming days.</p>
<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>
<p>In a recent court decision, rights have been granted to the daughter of Nelson Mandela to sell some of his personal items, including his prison key, sunglasses, and shirt. This ruling overcomes governmental efforts to prevent their export, arguing that these belongings are part of South Africa's heritage. The case highlights ongoing debates about the ownership and preservation of cultural artifacts.</p>
<h2>Maritime and Trade</h2>
<p>Despite the UK government's pledge of "assertive" action, a BBC analysis found that 42 Russian tankers subject to sanctions have navigated through the English Channel since January 11. This raises questions about the effectiveness of current sanctions enforcement in controlling maritime trade routes.</p>
