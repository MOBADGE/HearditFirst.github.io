    <h2>Entertainment: Oscar Nominations Surprise</h2>
<p>The nominations for the upcoming Oscars brought some unexpected surprises. Notably, actors Paul Mescal and Chase Infiniti missed out on nods, despite their roles in highly anticipated films. Instead, other performers emerged to carry their movies to receive nominations. This shake-up in expectations has drawn attention to how awards can reflect broader trends in filmmaking and performance, possibly shifting focus toward different styles or genres this year.</p>
<h2>International Security: Controversy Over Afghanistan War Comments</h2>
<p>The US president sparked controversy by claiming that NATO and allied troops "stayed a little back" rather than taking frontline positions during the war in Afghanistan. These comments have caused anger among some who feel they misrepresent the commitment and sacrifices made. The statement may affect ongoing discussions about military cooperation and public understanding of past conflicts.</p>
<h2>Nigeria: Church Abduction and Ongoing Violence</h2>
<p>At least 160 people remain unaccounted for following a brutal attack on three churches in a Nigerian village over the weekend. One survivor described the scene as chaotic and bloody while escaping the assailants. This incident highlights ongoing security challenges in the region and the vulnerability of civilians during such violent raids.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Relations: US Withdraws Canada's Invite to 'Board of Peace'</h2>
<p>In a surprising diplomatic move, the US president withdrew Canada’s invitation to participate in a forum called the "Board of Peace." No official reason was given, but this comes shortly after Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed concerns about a possible "rupture" in the US-led global order. This development signals strains in North American diplomatic relations and could have broader implications for international collaboration.</p>
<h2>Charity and Music: New Album Supports War Child</h2>
<p>Several prominent artists, including Olivia Rodrigo, Arctic Monkeys, and Pulp, have contributed new songs to "Help 2," a star-studded charity album supporting War Child. The project aims to raise awareness and funds for children affected by conflict around the world. This effort demonstrates how the music industry can rally to support humanitarian causes and bring global attention to pressing issues.</p>
