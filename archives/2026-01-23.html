    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 23, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Military Sacrifices Recognized</h2>
<p>Prince Harry highlighted the sacrifices made by NATO troops in Afghanistan, emphasizing that their service deserves respect. His comments come amid criticism from international allies, including UK veterans and politicians, who condemned remarks made by the US president related to the conflict. A BBC security correspondent also noted that not only Americans but also British, Canadian, and Danish forces experienced some of the toughest fighting during the Afghanistan war. These discussions underscore ongoing debates about how global contributions during the war are remembered and valued.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Peace Talks Underway</h2>
<p>Peace talks involving Ukraine, Russia, and the United States are currently in progress, with former US President Donald Trump advocating strongly for a deal. However, significant unresolved issues remain between Russia and Ukraine, tempering expectations of a swift resolution. The negotiations hold high stakes given the ongoing conflict but face challenges that could prolong the process. Observers are watching closely to see if the talks can lead to substantial progress toward ending hostilities.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Yemen</h2>
<p>The BBC reported from former United Arab Emirates bases in Yemen where secret prisons are believed to have been operated. Families of detainees described severe abuse occurring at these sites, and some individuals have gone months without contact with their loved ones. This coverage sheds light on human rights concerns connected to the conflict in Yemen and the roles of external actors, raising questions about accountability and transparency.</p>
<h2>Investigation into Spanish Train Disaster</h2>
<p>A preliminary investigation into the high-speed train crash in Spain, which resulted in 45 deaths, found evidence of a fractured section of track more than two hours before the accident occurred. This discovery points to potential infrastructure failures that may have contributed to the tragedy. Authorities continue to probe the circumstances to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve rail safety measures.</p>
<h2>Eyewitness Account of Iran Protests</h2>
<p>An Iranian émigré shared firsthand accounts of protests and the violent crackdown by security forces in her hometown. She described chaotic scenes, including people being shot during demonstrations. These reports are part of broader concerns about political unrest and human rights in Iran amid ongoing protests.</p>
<h2>Notable Arrest in US Drug Trafficking Case</h2>
<p>Ryan Wedding, a former Olympian and alleged drug lord, was arrested after years on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He is accused of leading an extensive transnational drug trafficking operation. This arrest marks a significant development in efforts to dismantle major criminal networks involved in international drug trade.</p>
