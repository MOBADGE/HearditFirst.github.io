    <h2>International Diplomacy and Conflict</h2>
<p>Donald Trump, the US president, is intensifying efforts to broker peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Despite this push, significant disagreements remain unresolved between the two countries, leaving expectations for a breakthrough cautious. Separately, Trump has withdrawn Canada’s invitation to a Board of Peace without explanation, following remarks by Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney about tensions in the US-led global order.</p>
<p>In the UK, Trump’s comment that NATO troops stayed “a little off the front lines” during the Afghanistan conflict has sparked outrage, particularly in the UK where 457 military personnel died. This has drawn criticism from veterans and officials who feel the statement downplays the risks and sacrifices made.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>The BBC has investigated secret prisons in Yemen run by the United Arab Emirates. Former detainees report abuse at these sites located on former UAE bases. This revelation sheds light on the harsh conditions faced by prisoners and raises questions about accountability.</p>
<p>In Iran, an eyewitness who recently fled described violent scenes during a protest crackdown. Security forces reportedly opened fire on demonstrators in her hometown, leading to chaos and casualties. The ongoing unrest highlights deep domestic tensions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the Taliban released Khadija Ahmadzada, a 22-year-old female athlete, after 13 days in detention. She was reportedly detained for violating Taliban rules regarding women's sports gyms, showing continued restrictions on women’s participation in sports under Taliban governance.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Emergencies</h2>
<p>In Pakistan, the death toll from a fire at Gul Plaza mall in Karachi has risen to 67. Authorities are still working to identify the bodies recovered from the wreckage. This fire adds to ongoing concerns about safety standards in crowded urban spaces.</p>
<p>In Australia, an autopsy has confirmed that Piper James, a Canadian woman found dead on a beach surrounded by dingoes, likely drowned. The cause of death did not indicate harm from wildlife, providing some clarity amid community concerns.</p>
<h2>Weather and Public Safety</h2>
<p>The United States is preparing for a severe winter storm expected to pose a "life-threatening risk of hypothermia," according to the National Weather Service. Residents in affected areas are advised to take precautions as the extreme cold weather moves in, posing challenges for vulnerable populations and emergency services.</p>
<h2>Crime and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Ryan Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder and fugitive wanted by the FBI, has been arrested. He has been accused of operating a large drug trafficking network, and his capture ends a long-running manhunt. The arrest marks a significant step in ongoing efforts to dismantle major criminal organizations.</p>
