    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump made headlines with two significant developments related to international relations. He sparked controversy by claiming that NATO troops "stayed a little back" and avoided the front line during the Afghanistan war. This remark drew anger as it appeared to question the commitment of allied forces during a major conflict. Additionally, Trump withdrew an invitation for Canada to join the so-called "Board of Peace." No explicit reason was given for this decision, but it follows comments from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warning of a "rupture" in the US-led global order. These actions could signal increasing tensions between the US and its allies, raising questions about the future of longstanding partnerships.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>A serious security incident unfolded in Nigeria, where attackers raided three churches in a village on Sunday. The attack left an estimated 160 people missing, causing widespread fear and concern. One survivor described a harrowing escape amid chaos, saying there was "blood all over." This event highlights ongoing issues with violence and instability in parts of Nigeria, drawing attention to the urgent need for protective measures for vulnerable communities.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Industry</h2>
<p>The 2026 Oscar nominations brought some surprises, including notable snubs and unexpected picks. Actors Paul Mescal and Chase Infiniti were left out of nominations, while other performers helped carry their films to recognition. The nominations reflect shifts in the film industry and may influence award season momentum. Industry watchers are keen to see how these surprises affect the eventual winners and the broader cultural conversation around cinema.</p>
<h2>Charity and Music</h2>
<p>A star-studded charity album titled "Help 2" is generating buzz as artists like Olivia Rodrigo, Arctic Monkeys, and Pulp contributed new songs. The album benefits War Child, a charity working to support children affected by conflict. This project continues a tradition of musicians using their platforms and talents to raise awareness and funds for humanitarian causes, potentially inspiring further creative collaborations for social good.</p>
