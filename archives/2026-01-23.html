    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 23, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Military Service and Recognition</h2>
<p>Recent comments from the US president regarding NATO troops in Afghanistan have sparked condemnation from international allies, including UK veterans and politicians. The controversy centers on the respect and acknowledgement due to those who served. The BBC’s security correspondent highlighted that not only American forces but also British, Canadian, and Danish troops faced some of the toughest combat in Afghanistan. This discussion underscores ongoing sensitivities about the contributions and sacrifices of allied military personnel over the years.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Peace Talks Under Scrutiny</h2>
<p>Diplomatic efforts to reach a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine continue, with high stakes involved but cautious expectations. Former US president Donald Trump is actively pushing for a deal, signaling potential shifts in negotiation dynamics. However, significant unresolved issues remain between the two countries, suggesting that any progress will be complex. The talks are closely watched as the international community seeks stability in a region that has experienced prolonged conflict.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Yemen</h2>
<p>New reports have shed light on secret prisons in Yemen reportedly run by the United Arab Emirates. The BBC visited former UAE bases where detainees claim they were subjected to abuse. Families of prisoners express anguish, with some recounting months without contact with their loved ones. These findings contribute to ongoing concerns about human rights violations amid the Yemeni conflict and highlight the role of foreign actors in the region.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Safety Alerts</h2>
<p>Two major safety alerts have emerged this week related to natural disasters. In the US, the National Weather Service has issued warnings about an "extremely dangerous" winter storm expected to bring life-threatening conditions, including severe cold and risk of hypothermia. Meanwhile, in Spain, a preliminary investigation into a recent high-speed train crash that killed 45 people found that the track was fractured more than two hours before the accident. Authorities continue examining safety measures to prevent such tragedies.</p>
<h2>Political Tensions and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, recently visited Greenland to show support following threats from the US president about potentially taking control of the territory. This visit highlights the ongoing geopolitical sensitivities surrounding Greenland’s strategic importance. Additionally, the president of Somaliland met with the son of the former US president and with his Israeli counterpart to promote business opportunities. Israel’s recognition of Somaliland’s independence marks a notable development for the region’s international relations.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security Developments</h2>
<p>In law enforcement news, Ryan Wedding, a former Olympian, has been arrested after years on the run. He was on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list and is accused of leading a major international drug trafficking network. This arrest marks a significant breakthrough in efforts to tackle transnational crime.</p>
