    <h2>European Union Takes Action Against Iran</h2>
<p>The European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list. This decision comes as a response to Iran's violent crackdown on protesters, which has drawn international criticism. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas cited the deadly measures used by Tehran against demonstrators as justification for the move. By labeling the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization, the EU aims to increase pressure on Iran. This development may further strain relations between the EU and Iran and impact international diplomacy surrounding Iran’s domestic policies.</p>
<h2>Israeli Hostage Freed After 500 Days in Gaza</h2>
<p>Sasha Troufanov, an Israeli hostage held in Gaza for nearly 500 days, spoke publicly for the first time since his release. In a BBC interview, he described the ordeal, saying he feared he would not survive captivity after being taken on 7 October 2023. Troufanov’s release marks a significant moment amid ongoing tensions and conflicts in the region. His story highlights the human impact of the prolonged conflict, while raising questions about future efforts to secure the release of other hostages.</p>
<h2>France Moves to End Marital Sexual Duty Law</h2>
<p>France is proposing a new bill to abolish the legal concept of “conjugal rights,” which implies that spouses have a duty to have sex within marriage. If passed, this legislation would formally end the notion that marriage includes an obligation for sexual relations. The move reflects broader societal changes about consent and personal freedom in intimate relationships. The bill could influence how marital rights and personal autonomy are legally recognized in France moving forward.</p>
<h2>Effort to Save Potatoes in Germany’s Surplus Harvest</h2>
<p>A German farm is distributing millions of potatoes for free in what has been called “the great potato rescue.” This initiative aims to prevent a large surplus of potatoes from going to waste after an exceptionally successful harvest season. The effort shows a creative approach to food surplus management, helping to reduce waste and support local communities. It may also encourage similar food-sharing programs in agricultural regions facing surplus challenges.</p>
<h2>US Government Funding Talks Intensify After Minneapolis Shooting</h2>
<p>In the United States, budget talks are intensifying as Democrats push to remove funding for the Department of Homeland Security unless new safety measures are enacted. This comes in the wake of a recent shooting in Minneapolis, which has raised concerns over security policies. The discussions are part of broader negotiations to prevent a government shutdown. What happens next could affect federal funding and security agency operations in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Continued Conflict and Exchanges Between Ukraine and Russia</h2>
<p>As part of ongoing conflict management, Ukraine recently received 1,000 bodies of soldiers in a swap with Russia. Russia received the bodies of 38 soldiers in return. This exchange reflects ongoing efforts by the warring countries to handle the human toll of their conflict. It also underscores the continuing challenges of reaching broader peace or ceasefire agreements while violence persists.</p>
