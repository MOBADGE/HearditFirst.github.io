    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The European Union has designated Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization, a response to Tehran's harsh crackdown on protesters. This move signals increased tensions between the EU and Iran and may lead to tighter sanctions or diplomatic pressure on Tehran.</p>
<p>In Niger's capital, heavy gunfire and explosions were reported near the airport, which also hosts an air force base. The airport is located roughly six miles from the presidential palace. The situation is developing, and the proximity to key government sites raises concerns about the country's security.</p>
<h2>Middle East Conflict Updates</h2>
<p>Israeli media have cited an official acknowledging a Hamas figure of 70,000 war dead amid the ongoing conflict. Israel had previously questioned the accuracy of Hamas-run health ministry statistics, although the United Nations considers those figures credible. Meanwhile, a recent soldier exchange between Ukraine and Russia has seen Ukraine receive 1,000 bodies while returning 38 soldiers' bodies to Russia, reflecting the ongoing toll and complex negotiations between the countries.</p>
<h2>Social and Legal Changes in Europe</h2>
<p>France is considering a new bill to abolish the concept of "conjugal rights," which legally implied a marital duty to have sex. If passed, this law would reaffirm that marriage does not oblige either partner to engage in sexual activity, marking a significant shift in French family law and personal rights.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Culture</h2>
<p>Sasha Troufanov, who was held hostage in Gaza for nearly 500 days since October 2023, spoke in his first international interview about his ordeal. He described fearing for his life during captivity and expressed relief now that he is free.</p>
<p>In Germany, a farm is giving away millions of potatoes in an initiative dubbed "the great potato rescue" after an abundant harvest threatened to waste the crop. This community-focused effort aims to reduce food waste and share surplus produce.</p>
<h2>Politics and Popular Culture in the US and Abroad</h2>
<p>In the United States, the Senate recently blocked a government funding bill amid ongoing negotiations about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. The House of Representatives is currently on recess until Monday, delaying further legislative action.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rapper Nicki Minaj has publicly declared herself the "number one fan" of the US president, showing off a gold card visa in a display of support. This contrasts with protests by other American artists, such as Bruce Springsteen, who are opposing ICE policies.</p>
<p>In South Africa, a documentary about Melania Trump will not be shown in cinemas. No official reason has been provided, but the decision comes after a significant diplomatic fallout between South Africa and the United States.</p>
