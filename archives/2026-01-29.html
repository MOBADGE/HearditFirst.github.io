    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 29, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>The European Union has designated Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization, responding to Tehran's violent suppression of protesters. This marks an important step in increasing pressure on Iran amid ongoing unrest. Meanwhile, violence continues in other regions: heavy gunfire was reported near the airport in Niger's capital, raising concerns due to the proximity of the presidential palace and a military airbase.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Israeli media reported an official acknowledging a Hamas figure of 70,000 war dead, a number that Israel had previously questioned despite the UN's recognition of the Hamas-run health ministry as a reliable source.</p>
<h2>Hostage Release and War Updates</h2>
<p>Sasha Troufanov, who was held hostage in Gaza for nearly 500 days, gave his first international interview describing the trauma and fear he experienced after being captured on 7 October 2023. His release highlights the ongoing human cost of conflicts in the region.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ukraine and Russia completed a body exchange involving more than 1,000 soldiers, with Russia receiving 38 bodies in return. This humanitarian gesture comes amid ongoing hostilities and signals continued, albeit limited, cooperation between the two sides.</p>
<h2>Domestic Policy and Social Change</h2>
<p>France is moving to abolish the legal concept of "marital duty" to have sex, sometimes called conjugal rights. A proposed bill aims to formally end the notion that marriage imposes an obligation to engage in sexual activity, reflecting evolving views on personal autonomy within marriage.</p>
<p>In Germany, a farming initiative called "the great potato rescue" is underway, where a farm is giving away millions of potatoes following a bumper harvest to prevent waste. This effort highlights innovative approaches to food sustainability at the local level.</p>
<h2>U.S. Political and Cultural Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, talks to prevent a government shutdown are intensifying after a recent shooting in Minneapolis. Democrats are pushing efforts to block Department of Homeland Security funding unless new security measures are adopted, reflecting deep political divides.</p>
<p>On the cultural front, rapper Nicki Minaj expressed strong support for the U.S. president, calling herself his "number one fan" and showcasing a gold card Visa, amid other high-profile voices like Bruce Springsteen protesting immigration enforcement policies.</p>
<h2>Global Media and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>A documentary about Melania Trump has been pulled from cinemas in South Africa, with no official explanation given. The decision follows a diplomatic fallout between South Africa and the United States, though further details remain unclear.</p>
