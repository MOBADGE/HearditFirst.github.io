    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 29, 2026</div>
    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Donald Trump said that Vladimir Putin will not attack Ukrainian cities during an upcoming cold week, though Russia has not confirmed this promise. Ukraine’s president has expressed hope that Putin’s pledge will be upheld. This development could signal a temporary de-escalation in the conflict, offering a brief period of respite. However, the situation remains tense, with ongoing uncertainty about Russia’s next moves.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Enforcement in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, involved in US immigration operations, indicated that agents deployed in Minneapolis might be withdrawn if local officials cooperate more fully. He described the immigration efforts as becoming more "targeted" in response to concerns raised by the city and members of Congress. This suggests that the federal government is adjusting its approach to immigration enforcement to reduce tensions and focus resources more efficiently.</p>
<h2>European Union Sanctions on Iran</h2>
<p>The European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated the decision is a reaction to Iran's harsh crackdown on protesters. This move escalates diplomatic pressure on Tehran and may lead to further consequences for Iran’s international relations. It highlights ongoing concerns about human rights abuses in Iran and the EU’s stance on addressing them.</p>
<h2>Changes to Marital Law in France</h2>
<p>France is considering a bill to abolish the concept of "conjugal rights," which refers to the idea that marriage imposes a duty to have sex. The proposed legislation would formally end this notion in law, representing a shift toward recognizing individual autonomy within marriage. If passed, this could influence legal and social understandings of consent and marital obligations in France.</p>
<h2>Agricultural Surplus in Germany</h2>
<p>A German farm is distributing millions of surplus potatoes to prevent them from going to waste, in an effort dubbed "the great potato rescue." This initiative addresses the challenges of overproduction and food waste, aiming to make good use of a bumper harvest. It reflects growing attention to sustainable food practices and community support.</p>
<h2>Middle East Casualty Reports</h2>
<p>Israeli media have cited an official source accepting a figure of 70,000 war dead reported by Hamas. While Israel has previously expressed skepticism about numbers from the Hamas-run health ministry, the United Nations considers that ministry reliable. This acknowledgement could impact perspectives on the conflict’s human toll and inform future discussions on the situation.</p>
<h2>Additional Global Headlines</h2>
<p>Heavy gunfire and explosions were reported near the airport in Niger’s capital, which also hosts an air force base near the presidential palace. This raises security concerns in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, alongside others, faces pressure as the military reportedly suppresses dissent, indicating ongoing political tensions within Pakistan.</p>
<p>In cultural news, a documentary about Melania Trump is not being shown in South African cinemas following a diplomatic fallout between South Africa and the United States, though no official reason has been provided.</p>
<p>Lastly, Donald Trump warned Iran that "time is running out" to revive the nuclear deal, as the US increases its military presence in the Gulf. Iran has responded by stating its forces are prepared to respond to any aggression, maintaining a firm stance in the diplomatic standoff.</p>
