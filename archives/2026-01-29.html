    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise Over Iran Nuclear Deal</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has issued a warning to Iran, saying "time is running out" for a nuclear deal. This comes as the US military increases its presence in the Gulf region. Iran responded by stating that its armed forces are prepared to react to any aggression, with troops described as ready "with their fingers on the trigger." The heightened military activity raises concerns of escalating tensions in the region, which could potentially affect global security and energy markets depending on how diplomatic efforts progress.</p>
<h2>US Border Shooting Prompts Leave for Agents</h2>
<p>In the United States, border agents involved in the fatal shooting of nurse Alex Pretti have been placed on leave. This incident has triggered a strong public reaction and contributes to ongoing debates about immigration enforcement practices. Meanwhile, former President Trump and the Mayor of Minneapolis have clashed on social media regarding immigration law enforcement, illustrating deep polarization on this issue. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and its outcome may influence future enforcement policies and public trust in border agencies.</p>
