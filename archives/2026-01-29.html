    <h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its list of terrorist organizations. This decision was announced by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and is in response to Iran's violent crackdown on protesters. The move marks a significant escalation in the EU’s stance towards Tehran amid ongoing tensions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, analysts are considering possible consequences if the US were to launch strikes on Iran. These range from regime change in Tehran to retaliatory attacks, highlighting complex geopolitical risks. The situation remains tense, with global attention on how any military action might unfold.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Politics</h2>
<p>In Washington, negotiations are intensifying to prevent a US government shutdown. Talks are focused on funding measures for the Department of Homeland Security. Democratic lawmakers are advocating for the removal of DHS funding unless new safety and security measures are adopted. This budget dispute follows a recent shooting in Minneapolis, adding pressure to an already difficult legislative environment.</p>
<p>Also in US politics, Senator Amy Klobuchar has announced her candidacy for governor of Minnesota. She is stepping into the race after the current governor, Tim Walz, ended his campaign early. Klobuchar’s entry is seen as a key moment for the Democratic Party in the state.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Violence in Africa</h2>
<p>Niger’s capital experienced heavy gunfire and blasts near the airport, which also hosts an air force base. The site is located approximately six miles from the presidential palace, suggesting heightened security concerns amid political instability. Details about the source or impact of the violence remain limited.</p>
<p>In a separate development related to armed conflict, Ukraine has received 1,000 bodies of soldiers returned in a recent exchange with Russia, with Russia receiving 38 bodies in return. This prisoner and remains swap reflects ongoing efforts to manage human costs amidst the prolonged conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Regional Unrest and Travel Disruptions</h2>
<p>Tensions appear to be escalating in northern Ethiopia, where flights have been cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances." Officials have not provided detailed reasons, but the cancellations come amid fears of renewed conflict in the area, raising concerns about security and stability for local residents and travelers.</p>
<h2>Cultural News</h2>
<p>In entertainment, Indian singer Arijit Singh has retired from Bollywood playback singing at the age of 38. Singh, recognized as one of Bollywood’s most beloved voices for over a decade, received widespread tributes from fans and industry figures, marking the end of a notable musical career.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trinidadian-American rapper Nicki Minaj recently expressed strong support for the US President, calling herself his "number one fan." She was seen holding hands with him on stage during a public event that took place amid protests involving the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). This moment attracted significant attention and reflects cultural intersections with political issues.</p>
