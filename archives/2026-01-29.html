    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise Over Potential US Action on Iran</h2>
<p>The United States is preparing for possible military strikes on Iran, with President Trump warning that “time is running out” for a nuclear deal. In response, Iran’s armed forces have declared they are ready to act “with their fingers on the trigger.” Analysts outline several possible scenarios if the US carries out strikes, ranging from direct retaliation by Iran to wider regional instability. The situation remains tense as the US builds up its military presence in the Gulf. This standoff could have serious consequences for global security and the stability of the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Security Incident at Niger’s Capital Airport</h2>
<p>Heavy gunfire and explosions were reported near the airport in Niamey, the capital of Niger. The airport also serves as an air force base and is located about six miles from the presidential palace. Details about who was involved or the reason for the incident remain unclear. This security breach near key government and military sites raises concerns about stability in Niger and the potential for further unrest.</p>
<h2>US Border Agents Placed on Leave After Fatal Shooting</h2>
<p>Border agents have been placed on leave following the fatal shooting of nurse Alex Pretti. The incident has sparked public outcry amid ongoing national debates about immigration enforcement. Tensions are further heightened by public disputes on social media between former President Trump and the Mayor of Minneapolis over immigration policies. The investigation into this case continues, highlighting challenges in managing border security and use-of-force protocols.</p>
<h2>Crackdown on Scam Operations Linked to Myanmar</h2>
<p>China has executed 11 members of the Ming family, accused of running scam centers based in Myanmar. State media report that the crackdown targets a major criminal network responsible for widespread fraud. This action demonstrates China’s increasing willingness to pursue cross-border crime and enforce severe penalties against organized scam operations, which have caused financial harm in the region.</p>
<h2>Deutsche Bank Offices Raided in Money Laundering Investigation</h2>
<p>Authorities have raided Deutsche Bank offices in Frankfurt and Berlin as part of an ongoing money laundering probe. The searches relate to the bank's "past business relationships," though specific details have not been disclosed. This development adds to ongoing scrutiny of major financial institutions and their compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation could lead to legal or regulatory consequences for the bank.</p>
<h2>Indian Singer Arijit Singh Retires Amid Public Tributes</h2>
