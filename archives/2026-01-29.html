    <div class="date">January 29, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>The European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its list of terrorist organizations. This decision was announced by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as a response to Iran’s crackdown on protesters, which has resulted in deaths. Meanwhile, near the airport in Niger’s capital, heavy gunfire and blasts have been reported. The airport also serves as an air force base and is close to the presidential palace, raising concerns about security in the area.</p>
<p>In ongoing conflict-related news, Ukraine and Russia conducted a soldier exchange, which included the return of 1,000 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers to Ukraine. Russia also received 38 bodies of its soldiers. These exchanges are part of continuing efforts related to the war between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, Senator Amy Klobuchar has announced her candidacy for governor of Minnesota. She is stepping into the race after the current governor, Tim Walz, ended his re-election campaign early. This move sets the stage for the upcoming gubernatorial election in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Additionally, U.S. domestic politics see increased tensions as Democrats push to withdraw funding for the Department of Homeland Security unless new reforms are put in place. This is happening amid negotiations aimed at preventing a government shutdown, with talks intensifying following a recent shooting in Minneapolis.</p>
<h2>Social and Legal Changes</h2>
<p>France is proposing a new bill to abolish the legal concept of "marital duty" to have sex, sometimes called "conjugal rights." If passed, this would formally end the idea that marriage includes a legal obligation for sexual relations. The bill reflects broader discussions on marital rights and personal freedoms.</p>
<h2>Culture and Media</h2>
<p>A documentary about Melania Trump will not be shown in cinemas in South Africa. No official reason has been given for the decision, which comes amid strained relations between South Africa and the United States.</p>
<p>In the world of music and public figures, rapper Nicki Minaj has publicly expressed her support for the U.S. president, calling herself his “number one fan” and showing off a gold visa card. This comes alongside protests by other artists such as Bruce Springsteen, who has criticized immigration enforcement policies.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement and Justice</h2>
<p>China has carried out executions of 11 members of the Ming family, who were involved in running scam centers in Myanmar. State media reported these executions, highlighting the cross-border efforts to combat fraud and organized crime linked to the scam operations.</p>
<h2>Personal Stories from Conflict</h2>
<p>In a rare international interview, Sasha Troufanov, who was held hostage in Gaza for nearly 500 days, spoke about his ordeal. Taken hostage on October 7, 2023, Troufanov shared how he feared dying in captivity and expressed relief at his release, saying, “I can breathe again.” His story highlights the human impact of ongoing conflicts in the region.</p>
