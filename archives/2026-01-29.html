    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise Over Iran</h2>
<p>The United States is increasing military presence in the Gulf amid mounting tensions with Iran. Former US President Donald Trump has warned that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal with Tehran. In response, Iranian armed forces declared they are prepared to respond swiftly to any aggression, saying they have their "fingers on the trigger." Analysts have outlined a range of possible outcomes if the US strikes Iran, including retaliation by Iranian forces, disruption of global oil supplies, increased regional instability, and even the potential for regime change. The situation remains highly volatile, with diplomatic efforts under pressure and the risk of conflict growing.</p>
<h2>Fatal Shooting Prompts Leave for Border Agents</h2>
<p>US border agents involved in the fatal shooting of nurse Alex Pretti have been placed on administrative leave. The incident has intensified debates around immigration law enforcement, with political figures such as Donald Trump and the Mayor of Minneapolis exchanging comments on social media about the issue. The case continues to fuel public discussion about the conduct of border authorities and the broader challenges of immigration policy in the United States.</p>
<h2>China Executes Myanmar Scam Group Members</h2>
<p>China has executed 11 members of a criminal gang from the Ming family that operated scam centers in Myanmar. The crackdown was reported by Chinese state media and reflects ongoing efforts by authorities to combat cross-border criminal activities. These executions underscore China's commitment to suppressing organized crime extending beyond its borders, particularly groups involved in large-scale fraud impacting hundreds of victims.</p>
<h2>Violence Near Airport in Niger’s Capital</h2>
<p>Heavy gunfire and explosions were reported near the airport in Niamey, the capital of Niger. The airport includes an air force base and is located about 10 kilometers from the presidential palace. The nature and source of the attacks remain unclear. This incident raises concerns about security in the region and its potential implications for political stability in Niger, a country that has experienced several political upheavals in recent years.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories highlight ongoing security and political challenges around the world, from escalating tensions in the Middle East to law enforcement crises and regional conflicts in Africa and Asia. The coming days will be key in seeing whether diplomatic efforts can de-escalate tensions or if further violence will unfold.</p>
