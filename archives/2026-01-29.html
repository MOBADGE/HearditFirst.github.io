    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise Over US-Iran Relations</h2>
<p>The US has issued a warning to Iran, saying "time is running out" to salvage the nuclear deal. This warning comes as US military forces increase their presence in the Gulf region. Tehran responded strongly, declaring its armed forces are prepared to react immediately to any aggression. Experts are considering several possible outcomes if the US decides to strike Iran, ranging from regime change efforts to retaliatory attacks. The situation remains tense, with significant implications for regional stability and global security.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the United States</h2>
<p>Talks are intensifying in Washington to prevent a government shutdown. Democrats are pushing to remove funding for the Department of Homeland Security unless new security measures—which are yet to be defined—are implemented. This standoff follows a recent shooting in Minneapolis, which has heightened concerns over security policy. Meanwhile, on a different note, rapper Nicki Minaj publicly showed support for the US President by calling herself his "number one fan" during a stage appearance where they held hands, despite ongoing protests against immigration enforcement (ICE).</p>
<h2>Security Concerns in Africa and Asia</h2>
<p>Violence erupted near the airport in Niger's capital, with reports of heavy gunfire and blasts close to an air force base and near the presidential residence. The situation is developing, raising concerns about security in the region. In northern Ethiopia, all flights have been cancelled due to fears of renewed conflict, and passengers were informed that the cancellations are due to "unforeseen circumstances." These events underscore ongoing instability and the potential for escalating tensions in both countries.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement Actions in China and Germany</h2>
<p>China has executed 11 members of the Ming family, who were reported to be operating scam centers in Myanmar. This move reflects China's crackdown on transnational criminal networks involved in fraud. In Germany, authorities conducted raids at the offices of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt and Berlin as part of a money laundering investigation connected to the bank's previous business dealings. Both actions illustrate increased regulatory and legal pressure on organized crime and financial misconduct.</p>
<h2>Economic Uncertainty in India</h2>
<p>Investors in India are unsettled following a recent court ruling regarding a 2018 stake sale agreement. The ruling has raised fears that older transactions might now be subjected to greater tax scrutiny. This development is causing concerns about India's investment climate and could influence future foreign investment decisions. The ruling highlights ongoing challenges in balancing judicial oversight and investor confidence.</p>
<h2>Cultural Milestone in India</h2>
<p>In entertainment news, celebrated Bollywood singer Arijit Singh has announced his retirement at the age of 38. Singh has been one of the most popular voices in Bollywood music for over a decade. His departure has prompted widespread tributes from fans and the music industry alike, marking the end of an era for many admirers of his work.</p>
