    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict Developments</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin has promised not to attack Ukrainian cities during the current cold week. While Russia has not publicly confirmed this agreement, Ukraine’s president expressed hope that Putin would keep his promise. This development could temporarily reduce violence in the region, though the situation remains tense and closely monitored by the international community. The conflict's progression will depend on whether both sides uphold their commitments in the coming days.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Operation Adjusted in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, involved in the US immigration enforcement efforts, indicated that agents working in Minneapolis might be withdrawn if local officials cooperate more effectively. The operation, part of the Trump administration's strategy, is shifting towards becoming more "targeted" to ease tensions both within the city and among lawmakers in Washington. This move reflects an effort to balance enforcement with addressing community concerns about immigration policies and their local impact.</p>
<h2>European Union Lists Iranian Revolutionary Guards as Terrorists</h2>
<p>The European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list in response to Tehran’s forceful crackdown on protesters. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated that the decision is a consequence of Iran’s deadly suppression of civil unrest. This designation is likely to increase diplomatic strain between Iran and the EU and may lead to further sanctions or restrictions targeting Tehran's military and political entities.</p>
<h2>France Proposes Ending Marital Duty to Have Sex</h2>
<p>France is moving forward with a bill to abolish the legal concept of "conjugal rights," which currently implies a marital duty to have sex. The proposed law aims to enshrine in legislation the idea that marriage does not obligate spouses to engage in sexual relations. If passed, the change would represent a significant shift in family law and could influence societal attitudes towards consent within marriage.</p>
<h2>Aid and Agriculture: Germany’s Potato Giveaway</h2>
<p>In Germany, a farm has launched "the great potato rescue," giving away millions of surplus potatoes after a bumper harvest. This initiative is designed to save the potatoes from going to waste and is part of a larger awareness campaign about reducing food waste. The effort highlights challenges farmers face in managing production and surplus, with potential positive impacts on food distribution and environmental sustainability.</p>
<h2>Escalating Tensions in the Middle East and Africa</h2>
<p>Reports from Israeli media cite an official accepting Hamas's figure of 70,000 war dead, a number previously questioned by Israel despite the United Nations considering the Hamas-run health ministry’s data reliable. Meanwhile, the US military is bolstering its presence in the Gulf amid tension with Iran. Trump warned Iran that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal, while Tehran said its forces are ready to respond to any aggression.</p>
<p>Additionally, in Niger’s capital, Niamey, heavy gunfire and blasts were heard near the airport, which also hosts an air force base about six miles from the presidential palace. The incident signals ongoing instability in the region, though further details and the situation’s cause are not yet fully clear.</p>
