    <h2>Middle East Tensions Escalate</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and Iran continue to rise as the US military expands its presence in the Gulf. Former US President Donald Trump warned that "time is running out" for reaching a nuclear deal with Iran. Tehran responded by stating its armed forces are prepared to respond swiftly to any aggression, saying they have their "fingers on the trigger." Analysts have discussed various possible outcomes if US strikes on Iran occur, including military retaliation, regional destabilization, and impacts on global oil markets. The situation remains fragile, with international attention on how diplomatic and military actions will unfold.</p>
<h2>Violence Near Niger’s Capital Airport</h2>
<p>Heavy gunfire and explosions were reported near the airport in Niamey, the capital of Niger.
