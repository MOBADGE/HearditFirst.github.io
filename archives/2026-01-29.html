    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 29, 2026</div>
    <h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict Developments</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump said that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attack Ukrainian cities during the current cold spell. While Russia has not officially confirmed this claim, Ukraine’s president expressed hope that Putin will keep his promise. This potential pause in hostilities could provide temporary relief for civilians amid ongoing tensions, but the situation remains fragile.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Enforcement in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Tom Homan, involved in immigration operations, indicated that federal agents in Minneapolis might be scaled back if local officials cooperate with the effort. The Trump administration is aiming to make the immigration enforcement more "targeted" to reduce frustrations in the city and address concerns raised on Capitol Hill. This adjustment suggests a shift toward balancing enforcement with local cooperation.</p>
<h2>European Union Labels Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as Terrorists</h2>
<p>The European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas explained that this decision responds to Tehran's violent crackdown on protesters. This designation increases pressure on Iran internationally and could lead to further diplomatic and economic consequences.</p>
<h2>Legal Change in France on Marital Rights</h2>
<p>France is considering a bill to abolish the concept of "conjugal rights," which is the idea that marriage includes a duty to have sex. If passed, this law would formally end the legal recognition of marital duty to engage in sexual relations, reflecting evolving attitudes toward personal autonomy within marriage.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Situation in Niger</h2>
<p>Heavy gunfire and explosions have been reported near the airport in Niger’s capital, which also houses an air force base close to the presidential palace. The violence highlights ongoing instability in the region and raises concerns about security around key government and military sites.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Tensions and Military Build-Up</h2>
<p>In the Gulf region, tensions are rising as the US military strengthens its presence. Donald Trump warned that "time is running out" for maintaining a nuclear deal with Iran. Tehran responded by stating that its armed forces remain ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to face any aggression. This exchange underscores the risk of increased conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social News</h2>
<p>In other news, rapper Nicki Minaj publicly called herself former President Trump's "number one fan" and displayed a gold visa card, showing support amidst contrasting protests like those of Bruce Springsteen opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Meanwhile, a documentary about Melania Trump will not be shown in South African cinemas following deteriorated relations between South Africa and the US, though no explanation for the decision has been provided.</p>
<h2>Agriculture and Food Waste in Germany</h2>
<p>A German farm has launched a campaign known as "the great potato rescue" to distribute millions of potatoes after a particularly large harvest. This effort aims to prevent the potatoes from going to waste and highlights ongoing concerns about food sustainability.</p>
