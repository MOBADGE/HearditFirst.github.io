    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The European Union has added Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list. This decision was made in response to Iran's harsh crackdown on protesters, signaling increased tensions between the EU and Tehran. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Israeli media cited an official acknowledging a high death toll in the ongoing conflict, referencing a figure of 70,000 war dead as reported by the Hamas-run health ministry, which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>
<p>In Niger, heavy gunfire and explosions were reported near the airport in the capital, which also houses an air force base close to the presidential palace. The situation's details remain unclear but underline ongoing instability in the region.</p>
<h2>Hostage and War Updates</h2>
<p>Sasha Troufanov, an Israeli hostage who had been held in Gaza for nearly 500 days, shared his experience in a rare international interview. He described feeling he might not survive captivity after being taken hostage on 7 October 2023. In related news from Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Russia completed a body swap agreement involving soldiers, with Ukraine receiving 1,000 bodies and Russia receiving 38 in return. This exchange highlights the ongoing human cost of the conflict and the efforts to manage casualties.</p>
<h2>Domestic Policy Changes in France</h2>
<p>France is moving to abolish the legal concept of "marital duty" to have sex, known as conjugal rights. A proposed bill aims to eliminate the idea that marriage entails a legal obligation to engage in sexual activity. This legislative change reflects evolving views on marriage and personal rights within French society.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural News</h2>
<p>In Germany, a farm has launched "the great potato rescue" by giving away millions of potatoes after a bumper harvest. This initiative seeks to prevent food waste and redistribute excess produce to communities.</p>
<p>In the United States, talks are intensifying to prevent a government shutdown amid disagreements over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats are pressing for new security measures as part of the budget discussions, adding pressure to the already delicate negotiations.</p>
<h2>Other Noteworthy Updates</h2>
<p>A Melania Trump documentary has been pulled from cinemas in South Africa without an official explanation. The decision comes amid diplomatic tensions between South Africa and the US, though specific reasons remain undisclosed.</p>
<p>In popular culture, the rapper Nicki Minaj publicly expressed her support for the US president, describing herself as his "number one fan" and showcasing a gold card visa. This statement contrasts with other figures like Bruce Springsteen, who have protested against immigration enforcement policies.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These developments cover key international tensions, policy changes, and cultural moments shaping public conversation today.</p>
