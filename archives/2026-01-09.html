    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 09, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro expressed concern over what he called a "real threat" of US military action against his country. Speaking to the BBC, he criticized the United States for treating other nations as part of a US "empire." This statement comes after former US President Donald Trump threatened Colombia with military intervention. The situation highlights rising tensions between the two countries and raises questions about future diplomatic and security relations in the region.</p>
<p>At the same time, Venezuela is taking steps to reduce political tensions by beginning the release of political prisoners. The move responds to longstanding US demands, especially after the US captured Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. This development could signal a shift toward easing conflicts between the Venezuelan government and international actors, potentially impacting regional politics.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Russia carried out fresh missile strikes in Ukraine using the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile, marking only the second deployment of this weapon. The missile was previously used in November to strike the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. These continued strikes represent a significant escalation in the conflict and demonstrate Moscow's willingness to use advanced military technology in the ongoing war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, large peaceful protests have taken place in Tehran and other Iranian cities. Demonstrators gathered on major roads without any reported intervention by security forces. The calm nature of these rallies suggests a moment of relative restraint by Iranian authorities amid ongoing public dissent.</p>
<h2>Social Unrest in the United States</h2>
<p>Widespread protests continued for a second night across multiple US cities including Minneapolis, Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, and Philadelphia. The demonstrations relate to the shooting of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These events point to ongoing public unrest about law enforcement and immigration enforcement practices and may influence future policy discussions at the national level.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Emergencies</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, an accident at a private landfill in Cebu City led to one death and dozens of workers trapped under collapsed debris. Rescue teams have pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the rubble. This incident highlights concerns about safety standards in waste management facilities and the risks faced by workers in hazardous environments.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media Regulation</h2>
<p>In the UK, the government responded strongly to recent decisions limiting access to Grok AI's image editing features only to paid users, calling the move "insulting" to victims. This statement follows an official push for the communications regulator Ofcom to exercise its full powers, possibly including a ban on the social media platform X. The dispute underscores ongoing tensions around technology companies' content policies and the regulation of online platforms.</p>
<h2>Sports Update</h2>
<p>Swiss tennis player Stan Wawrinka has been awarded a wildcard entry to the Australian Open as he begins the final season of his career. Meanwhile, Australian player Nick Kyrgios will not receive a wildcard for the tournament. Wawrinka's participation will be closely watched as he wraps up his time on the professional circuit.</p>
