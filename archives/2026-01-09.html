    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 09, 2026</div>
    <h2>Protests and Political Unrest</h2>
<p>Large-scale anti-government protests took place in Tehran and other Iranian cities, including Iran’s second-largest city. Videos showed peaceful rallies on major roads in the capital and elsewhere. Notably, security forces did not disperse the protesters. This suggests a moment of relative calm amid ongoing dissatisfaction within the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, protests continued for a second night in multiple cities such as Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, and Philadelphia. These demonstrations were sparked by the shooting of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Minneapolis, highlighting ongoing tensions around law enforcement and immigration policies.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Developments</h2>
<p>The Venezuelan government has started releasing political prisoners, responding to long-standing demands from the United States. This development follows the recent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by US authorities, a major point of contention between the two countries. The release of detainees could signal a shift in Venezuela's political landscape and relations with the US.</p>
<h2>International Military and Security Actions</h2>
<p>In a notable military move, Russia struck Ukraine using a rarely deployed hypersonic ballistic missile called the Oreshnik. This was only the second known use of the missile, which was first employed in November last year during an attack on the city of Dnipro. The missile’s deployment underlines the ongoing intensity of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States seized a fifth oil tanker linked to Venezuela, known as the Olina. US officials said the tanker is on multiple countries’ sanctions lists and is suspected of carrying embargoed oil. This seizure reflects continuing international efforts to enforce sanctions against Venezuela’s oil exports.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Colombian President Gustavo Petro expressed concern about a "real threat" of US military action toward Colombia. He criticized former President Trump’s recent threats, suggesting that the US treats other nations as part of an "empire." Petro’s remarks point to rising tensions in US-Colombia relations.</p>
<h2>Domestic Incidents and Legal Actions</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, Jacques Moretti, owner of a ski bar, has been held in custody as a potential flight risk after a deadly fire occurred on New Year's Eve. Investigations are ongoing into the cause and accountability for the blaze.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, a massive collapse of a private landfill in Cebu City led to one confirmed death, with dozens trapped under debris. Rescue teams have pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the site, but the situation remains critical as efforts continue.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media Regulation in the UK</h2>
<p>The UK government has indicated it will support the communications regulator Ofcom if it blocks X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. This move reflects concern over deepfake videos generated by Grok AI on the platform. The government has urged Ofcom to consider using all its powers, including an effective ban of X, to combat the spread of misleading AI-generated content. This points to increasing regulatory scrutiny of online misinformation and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Today's news shows ongoing global unrest and tensions, with significant events in politics, military conflict, social justice, and technology regulation. These stories underscore complex international relations and domestic challenges that may evolve further in the days ahead.</p>
