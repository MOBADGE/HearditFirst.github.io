    <h2>International Tensions and Military Threats</h2>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro told the BBC that the United States poses a "real threat" of military action against Colombia. This comes after former US President Donald Trump made threats involving military intervention in the country. Petro criticized the United States for treating other nations as part of a US "empire," highlighting ongoing tensions in US-Latin America relations. The situation could escalate if diplomatic efforts do not address the concerns on both sides.</p>
<h2>Protests and Unrest in Iran</h2>
<p>Large anti-government protests have taken place in Tehran, Iran's capital, and several other cities. Videos confirmed by BBC Persian show buildings being set on fire as demonstrators chant slogans against the government. However, rallies on major roads in Tehran and Iran’s second-largest city remained peaceful, and security forces did not disperse the crowds. These demonstrations indicate rising public discontent and may lead to further unrest or government responses.</p>
<h2>Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The Venezuelan government has begun releasing political prisoners amid ongoing pressure from the United States. This comes after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, an unprecedented move that had demanded the liberation of detainees. The release of these prisoners could signal a shift in Venezuela’s internal politics and might affect relations with international actors, including the US.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Safety Disasters</h2>
<p>Australia’s state of Victoria is facing severe bushfire threats with all regions under "catastrophic" or "extreme" fire warnings. Residents are bracing for potential property losses and worse consequences as destructive fires advance. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, a massive landfill collapse in Cebu City has resulted in one death and 38 people reported missing. Rescue teams have pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the debris. These incidents highlight ongoing environmental and safety challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Social Issues Spotlight in India</h2>
<p>The killing of student Anjel Chakma has sparked protests across India, bringing renewed attention to racism in the country. The case has revived demands for an anti-racism law aimed at addressing ethnic discrimination and violence. The incident raises important questions about minority rights and social justice in India, which may lead to legislative or societal changes.</p>
