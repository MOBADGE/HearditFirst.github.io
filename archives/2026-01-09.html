    <h2>Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Peaceful anti-government protests have taken place in Tehran and other cities across Iran. Videos show rallies on major roads in the capital and in Iran’s second-largest city. Unlike some previous demonstrations, these gatherings were not dispersed by security forces. The widespread protests highlight ongoing public discontent with the government, though authorities' restraint in these cases may influence how the situation develops in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Tensions Over Venezuela Oil</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump is seeking $100 billion in oil-related investments in Venezuela. However, some oil industry executives remain cautious, noting Venezuela’s history of seizing foreign assets twice. One oil company chief described the country as "uninvestable," signaling challenges for any large-scale oil deals. Meanwhile, US officials have seized a fifth oil tanker linked to Venezuela, the Olina, on suspicion of carrying embargoed oil, reflecting ongoing enforcement of sanctions.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia has launched new strikes on Ukraine using the Oreshnik missile, a rare hypersonic ballistic weapon. This marks only the second time Moscow has deployed this missile, which was first used in November to target the city of Dnipro. The use of this advanced weaponry underscores the continued intensity of the conflict and may signal a shift in Russia’s military tactics.</p>
<h2>Disaster in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A landfill collapse in Cebu City, Philippines, has caused one death and left dozens trapped. Rescuers have so far pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the debris at the private landfill. The incident raises safety concerns about waste management sites in the region and will likely prompt calls for greater oversight to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<h2>International and Technology News</h2>
<p>The European Union has finalized a trade deal with South American countries after 25 years of negotiations. Despite opposition from some European farmers, EU officials said they addressed concerns during talks. In the UK, government ministers have warned that the social media platform X could face a ban over issues related to deepfakes. Officials are urging the communications regulator Ofcom to consider all powers, including an effective ban, to regulate the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, US actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea following DNA testing. They join other American celebrities who are reconnecting with their African heritage through citizenship. This development highlights growing cultural ties between African nations and the diaspora.</p>
<h2>Regional Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has expressed concern about what he describes as a "real threat" of US military action towards Colombia. Speaking to the BBC, Petro criticized the US for treating other countries as parts of an "empire." His comments follow threats made by Donald Trump regarding possible US military involvement, underscoring rising tensions in the region.</p>
