    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has expressed serious concerns over the possibility of U.S. military action against Colombia, describing it as a "real threat." In an interview with the BBC, Petro criticized the United States for treating other nations as part of an "empire," following recent threats from former U.S. President Donald Trump toward Colombia. This situation highlights ongoing tensions in U.S.-Colombia relations and raises questions about regional stability and diplomacy moving forward.</p>
<h2>Protests and Unrest in Iran</h2>
<p>Large-scale anti-government protests have taken place across Tehran and other cities in Iran. Videos show peaceful rallies along major roads, including in the capital and Iran's second largest city, without interference from security forces. However, there are also verified videos of buildings being set on fire as demonstrations spread, with protesters heard chanting slogans against the government. These events indicate significant public discontent, and the way Iranian authorities respond in the coming days could influence the country's political landscape.</p>
<h2>Venezuela's Political Prisoners Released</h2>
<p>The Venezuelan government has started releasing political prisoners, a development welcomed by the United States, which has long called for their freedom. This move comes after the recent capture of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. authorities. The release of these detainees could signal a shift in Venezuela's internal politics or an attempt to ease international pressure, though broader implications remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters in Australia and the Philippines</h2>
<p>Australia faces severe bushfire risks, with all regions in the state of Victoria under "catastrophic" or "extreme" fire warnings. Residents have been warned of potential property loss or worse as fires threaten homes and communities. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, a massive landfill collapsed in Cebu City, resulting in one confirmed death and 38 people missing. Rescue efforts have saved 12 injured sanitation workers from the debris. These events underscore challenges in disaster preparedness and response in both countries.</p>
<h2>Social Issues in India</h2>
<p>The killing of student Anjel Chakma has sparked protests across India and brought attention to issues of racism in the country. The incident has revived calls for the introduction of an anti-racism law. This case highlights ongoing social tensions and the demand for legal measures to protect minority communities, pointing to broader conversations about equality and justice in India.</p>
