    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has expressed concerns about a "real threat" of US military action, accusing the United States of treating other countries as part of an American "empire." His remarks followed threats from former US President Donald Trump aimed at Colombia. Meanwhile, US actions in Venezuela, including the recent capture of its leader Nicolás Maduro, have intensified discussions regarding the regional balance of power. These developments highlight shifting world order dynamics, leaving Europe and the European Union facing difficult decisions about aligning with US influence or other powers.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, Russia carried out fresh missile strikes using the rarely deployed Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile. This marked only the second time Moscow has launched this weapon, indicating a possible escalation of missile tactics in the ongoing conflict.</p>
<h2>Domestic Unrest and Protests</h2>
<p>Iran has witnessed large anti-government protests, notably in Tehran and Iran’s second largest city. Demonstrators gathered peacefully on major roads, and the security forces did not disperse the rallies. These developments suggest a notable moment of civil expression in the country without immediate violent crackdowns.</p>
<p>In India, the killing of student Anjel Chakma has brought the issue of racism to the forefront, sparking protests and renewed calls for legislation to combat racial discrimination. The incident has drawn wide attention and sparked demands for anti-racism laws to protect marginalized communities.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Safety Incidents</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, a major disaster occurred when a giant landfill collapsed in Cebu City. Rescue teams have pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the rubble, but at least one person has died, and dozens remain trapped. The incident underscores ongoing safety challenges in managing waste and protecting workers in hazardous environments.</p>
<h2>Technology and Online Platforms</h2>
<p>Elon Musk’s Grok AI, an image-editing tool, has been restricted to paid users of the social media platform X after concerns arose over deepfake content. This follows governmental pressure urging the UK communications regulator Ofcom to consider strong measures against X, including a possible ban, to address misuse linked to misinformation and synthetic media.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>Tennis player Stan Wawrinka has been granted a wildcard entry for the upcoming Australian Open as he begins the final season of his career. In contrast, Australian player Nick Kyrgios did not receive a wildcard, signaling a significant moment in the tournament’s player selections.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories reflect current global tensions, social movements, safety issues, and shifting technological landscapes, all of which may shape events and policies in the coming weeks and months.</p>
