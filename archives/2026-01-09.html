    <h2>Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Large, peaceful anti-government protests took place on major roads in Tehran and other cities in Iran, including the country’s second-largest city. Videos shared online show that these rallies were not broken up or dispersed by security forces. The demonstrations reflect ongoing public dissatisfaction, though the authorities appeared to exercise restraint on this occasion.</p>
<h2>Developments in Venezuela and US Relations</h2>
<p>The Venezuelan government has started releasing political prisoners, following long-standing demands from the United States. This comes amid rising tensions, as US authorities recently captured President Nicolás Maduro. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump is seeking to gain $100 billion for Venezuelan oil interests. However, some oil executives expressed skepticism about investing in Venezuela, citing past nationalizations of their assets. Additionally, the US has seized a fifth oil tanker linked to Venezuela, the Olina, which is suspected of carrying embargoed oil and is listed under sanctions by multiple countries.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia launched fresh missile strikes against Ukraine using a rarely deployed hypersonic ballistic weapon called the Oreshnik missile. This marks only the second known use of the missile by Moscow, which first targeted the city of Dnipro in November. The strikes demonstrate ongoing military escalation in the conflict between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Trade Agreement Between EU and South America</h2>
<p>After 25 years of negotiations, the European Union has reached a trade deal with South American countries. The agreement faced opposition from some European farmers, but the EU Commission stated it listened to their concerns during the process. The deal aims to strengthen economic ties and promote trade between the two regions.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, a section of a large landfill collapsed in Cebu City, killing one person and trapping dozens of workers. Rescuers have pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the debris.</p>
<p>In the UK, government officials have warned that the social media platform X could face a ban due to concerns over deepfake content. The government has urged the media regulator Ofcom to consider all enforcement options, including an effective ban on the platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, American actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after DNA tests confirmed their African heritage. They join other US celebrities reconnecting with their ancestral roots through African citizenship.</p>
<p>In Colombia, President Gustavo Petro told the BBC that the country faces a "real threat" of US military intervention, criticizing the US approach towards Latin American nations. This follows threats of military action against Colombia made by Donald Trump.</p>
