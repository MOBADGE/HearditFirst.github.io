    <h2>Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Massive anti-government protests took place in Tehran and other major Iranian cities. Videos show large crowds peacefully rallying on major roads in the capital and Iran's second largest city. Security forces did not disperse the gatherings, which marks a notable moment of restraint. The protests reflect ongoing public dissatisfaction, though the government’s next steps remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>US and Venezuela Relations</h2>
<p>The US has seized its fifth oil tanker connected to Venezuela. The tanker, named Olina, appears on sanctions lists from multiple countries and is suspected of transporting embargoed oil. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s government has started releasing political prisoners, a move the US has long sought after capturing Nicolás Maduro. These developments highlight continued tension and shifting dynamics between the two nations.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia launched fresh missile strikes against Ukraine using a rarely deployed hypersonic ballistic missile, the Oreshnik. This is only the second time this missile has been used, with its first deployment occurring in November. The use of such advanced weaponry indicates escalating military tactics in the conflict and could signal more dangerous phases ahead.</p>
<h2>US Military and International Tensions</h2>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro expressed concern to the BBC about a "real threat" of US military action following previous threats from former US President Donald Trump. Petro criticized the US approach as treating other countries like part of an "empire," highlighting strained relations and regional unease. Additionally, the current US administration warned Nigeria about further strikes if violence against Christians continues, reflecting ongoing US involvement in international security issues.</p>
<h2>Local Incidents and Protests</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, a devastating collapse at a giant landfill in Cebu City killed one person and trapped dozens of sanitation workers. Rescue teams have recovered 12 injured workers from the debris. Meanwhile, protests continued across several US cities including Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, and Philadelphia, in response to the fatal shooting of Renee Good by immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis. These events emphasize local public safety challenges and ongoing social unrest.</p>
<h2>UK Digital Regulation</h2>
<p>The UK government has told the communications regulator Ofcom to decide on imposing a ban on the social media platform X within days. The government has encouraged Ofcom to use all available powers, including an effective ban, amid concerns over the platform’s conduct. The outcome could shape the future regulatory landscape for social media in the UK.</p>
