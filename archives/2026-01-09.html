    <h2>Protests and Unrest in Iran</h2>
<p>Large demonstrations have been taking place across Tehran and other Iranian cities, marking some of the biggest protests in years. Rallies on major roads in the capital and Iran's second-largest city were reported as peaceful and were not dispersed by security forces. However, the unrest has turned deadly, with at least 48 protesters dead according to human rights groups. Iranian leadership has condemned the protests, labeling participants as vandals motivated by a desire to please former US president Donald Trump. These protests highlight continuing tensions within Iran and pose challenges for the government’s stability.</p>
<h2>Violence and Investigations in the United States</h2>
<p>A disturbing video has emerged showing the moments before a shooting in Minneapolis, where an ICE agent opened fire on a street. The footage offers insight into the incident that has raised concerns about law enforcement conduct. Meanwhile, in another case, the owner of a Swiss ski bar, Jacques Moretti, is being held in custody on suspicion related to a deadly fire that occurred on New Year's Eve. Authorities consider Moretti a potential flight risk, and investigations continue into the cause of the tragedy.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Tensions and Military Developments</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump has made headlines again by stating that the United States needs to "own" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from gaining control of the strategically important territory. He suggested acquiring Greenland could happen "the easy way" or "the hard way," although Denmark, which governs Greenland, firmly rejected the idea, saying the territory is not for sale. On the military front in Eastern Europe, Russia has launched fresh strikes against Ukraine using the rarely deployed Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile. This missile was first used in November to hit the city of Dnipro. The deployment signals a potential escalation in the conflict.</p>
<h2>Energy and Economic Issues</h2>
<p>In the energy sector, meetings led by Donald Trump regarding Venezuela’s oil resources have begun but yielded few concrete promises. Exxon’s chief executive Darren Woods commented that Venezuela’s oil industry is currently "uninvestable." Adding to sanctions enforcement, the United States has seized a fifth oil tanker linked to Venezuela. The vessel, named Olina, is suspected of carrying embargoed oil and is on several nations’ sanctions lists. These developments reflect ongoing challenges in global oil markets and diplomatic efforts to enforce sanctions.</p>
<h2>UK Regulatory Moves on Social Media</h2>
<p>In the United Kingdom, there are growing concerns about the use of deepfakes on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). UK government officials have urged the media regulator Ofcom to consider all regulatory tools, potentially including an effective ban against the platform, to combat the spread and risks of manipulated media content. This move signals increased regulatory scrutiny over social media platforms and the evolving challenges of digital misinformation.</p>
<h2>Disaster in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A major accident occurred at a private landfill in Cebu City, Philippines, where a giant waste pile collapsed. Rescuers have so far pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the debris, but unfortunately, at least one person has died. The incident underscores issues related to industrial safety and emergency response in densely populated urban areas. Rescue efforts and investigations are ongoing.</p>
