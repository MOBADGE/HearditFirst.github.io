    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, expressed concern over potential U.S. military action against his country. Speaking to the BBC, Petro criticized the United States for acting as an empire and treating other nations as part of its domain. His remarks followed threats from former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding military intervention in Colombia. These developments highlight rising tensions between Colombia and the U.S., raising questions about regional stability in Latin America.</p>
<h2>Protests and Social Movements</h2>
<p>Large anti-government protests took place in Tehran and other Iranian cities. Videos showed peaceful rallies on major roads in the capital and Iran's second-largest city, with no interference from security forces reported. The protests underscore ongoing dissatisfaction within parts of Iranian society, though the government’s restrained response in this instance may suggest a strategic decision to avoid escalation.</p>
<p>In India, the killing of Anjel Chakma, a student, has sparked widespread protests and brought attention to issues of racism and discrimination in the country. The incident has intensified calls for an anti-racism law to address systemic issues faced by minority groups, reflecting mounting public demand for legal and social reforms.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Russia launched fresh strikes on Ukraine using the Oreshnik missile, a hypersonic ballistic weapon rarely deployed before. This marks only the second recorded use of this missile since it was first employed to strike Dnipro in November. The use of advanced weaponry in the conflict indicates an escalation and highlights the ongoing volatility in the Russia-Ukraine situation.</p>
<h2>Disasters</h2>
<p>A tragic accident occurred in the Philippines when a giant landfill collapsed in Cebu City. The incident resulted in one confirmed death and dozens of sanitation workers trapped under debris. Rescue teams have so far recovered 12 injured workers. This disaster raises concerns about safety practices at disposal sites and the risks faced by workers in hazardous environments.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media</h2>
<p>Elon Musk’s AI-powered image editing tool, Grok AI, is now restricted to paid users of the social media platform X after concerns about the creation of deepfake content. This follows government pressure, with calls for regulatory agency Ofcom to take strong actions against the platform. Limiting access to this technology reflects ongoing challenges in balancing innovation with the prevention of misinformation and harmful digital content.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Political Developments</h2>
<p>The Venezuelan government has started releasing political prisoners, a move long demanded by the United States amid heightened political tensions. This development may signal a shift toward easing internal repression, though the broader political context remains complex following recent U.S. actions concerning Venezuelan leadership.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories together reveal significant shifts in global politics, social movements, and technology, with potential impacts on security, human rights, and governance in multiple regions.</p>
