    <h2>Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Large, peaceful anti-government protests took place on major roads in Tehran and Iran’s second-largest city. Videos of the rallies show no attempts by security forces to break them up. The protests reflect ongoing public discontent within the country, though authorities appeared to allow the gatherings to continue without intervention.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement and Detentions</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities are holding Jacques Moretti, owner of a ski bar, in custody following a deadly fire on New Year's Eve. Officials are concerned Moretti could flee the country, according to Swiss media reports.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, the government has started releasing political prisoners. This move follows international pressure, notably from the US, which has recently captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The release responds to long-standing demands for the detainees to be freed.</p>
<h2>International Tensions and Military Concerns</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US and Colombia have escalated, with Colombian President Gustavo Petro warning of a "real threat" of US military action. Petro criticized the US for treating other countries as part of an "empire" after President Donald Trump threatened Colombia with military intervention. Meanwhile, Trump warned of additional strikes in Nigeria if killings of Christians continue, referring to recent US military actions.</p>
<p>The US also seized the Olina, an oil tanker linked to Venezuela and listed on sanctions lists of multiple countries. US officials suspect the tanker of transporting embargoed oil, underscoring ongoing enforcement of sanctions amid geopolitical disputes.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security in Ukraine and the US</h2>
<p>Russia conducted fresh missile strikes on Ukraine using the Oreshnik, a hypersonic ballistic missile rarely used before. This marks only the second time Moscow has deployed this weapon, which was first used in November against Dnipro.</p>
<p>In the United States, protests erupted for a second night in multiple cities—including Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, and Philadelphia—over the killing of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis. The demonstrations highlight ongoing concerns about law enforcement conduct.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Disasters</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, a giant landfill collapsed in Cebu City, killing one person and injuring several sanitation workers. Rescuers have pulled 12 injured workers from the debris as search and rescue efforts continue. The incident raises concerns about the safety of waste management facilities and worker conditions.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media Regulation</h2>
<p>The UK government criticized recent changes made to Elon Musk’s AI system Grok, calling them "insulting" to victims. This comes amid calls from government officials for the communications regulator Ofcom to take strong enforcement actions against Musk’s platform X, up to and including an effective ban.</p>
