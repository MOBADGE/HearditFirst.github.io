    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 09, 2026</div>
    <h2>Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Large anti-government protests took place in Tehran and other cities across Iran. Videos show peaceful rallies on major roads in the capital and in Iran's second-largest city. Security forces did not disperse the crowds. These protests highlight continuing public discontent in the country, though the calm nature of the demonstrations suggests a current avoidance of violent confrontations. The situation may evolve depending on how authorities and protesters respond in the coming days.</p>
<h2>US and Venezuela Sanctions Enforcement</h2>
<p>The United States has seized a fifth oil tanker linked to Venezuela. The vessel, named Olina, is on sanctions lists of multiple countries and is suspected of carrying embargoed oil. This action continues the US’s efforts to enforce sanctions against Venezuelan-related entities amid ongoing political tensions. The seizure signals sustained pressure on Venezuela's regime and its economic operations, with further enforcement likely.</p>
<h2>Military and Diplomatic Tensions in the Americas</h2>
<p>Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, expressed concern over the possibility of US military action, describing US policies toward other nations as imperialistic. The remarks came after former US President Donald Trump threatened Colombia with military intervention. Separately, Trump warned Nigeria of additional military strikes if violence against Christians continues following recent strikes conducted around Christmas. These developments indicate heightened tensions and potential for increased US military involvement in different regions.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict Update</h2>
<p>Russia launched fresh strikes in Ukraine using the rarely deployed Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile. This marks only the second time Russia has used this weapon, previously employed in November to hit the city of Dnipro. The use of advanced missile technology signals an escalation in the conflict and could impact future military engagements and international responses.</p>
<h2>Landfill Disaster in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A giant landfill collapsed in Cebu City, Philippines, resulting in one death and dozens of workers becoming trapped under debris. Rescue teams have pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the site so far. The incident draws attention to safety concerns at waste disposal facilities and the urgent need for effective disaster response and worker protections in such environments.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Cultural Connections</h2>
<p>US film stars Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after DNA tests confirmed their heritage. They join a number of US celebrities reconnecting with their African roots by taking up citizenship in African nations. This trend reflects a growing interest in cultural identity and transcontinental ties among prominent figures in entertainment.</p>
<h2>Swiss Investigation into New Year's Eve Fire</h2>
<p>Jacques Moretti, owner of a Swiss ski bar, is being held in custody as a potential flight risk following a deadly fire on New Year's Eve. Swiss media report that authorities are investigating the incident, which raises questions about safety and accountability in public venues during major celebrations. Further legal proceedings are expected.</p>
