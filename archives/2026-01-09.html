    <h2>Iran Protests and Government Response</h2>
<p>Iran is experiencing some of its largest demonstrations in years, with rallies reported in Tehran and other cities. Videos show that protests on major roads in the capital and in Iran’s second city were peaceful and not dispersed by security forces. Human rights groups say at least 48 protesters have died during the unrest. Meanwhile, Iran’s leader described the anti-government protesters as vandals who are attempting to please former US President Trump, highlighting the tense political atmosphere surrounding the demonstrations.</p>
<h2>Tensions in Colombia Over US Military Threats</h2>
<p>Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, spoke to the BBC about concerns regarding threats of US military action. He stated that the United States is treating other nations as part of a US “empire,” referencing recent threats made by Trump against Colombia. This adds to the complexity of US-Colombia relations and could influence regional stability and diplomatic interactions moving forward.</p>
<h2>Security Incident in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>A video has emerged showing chaotic moments leading up to a shooting carried out by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent on a Minneapolis street. The footage captures the tense scene before gunfire erupted, providing new context on the incident and raising questions about law enforcement conduct and public safety.</p>
<h2>Swiss Investigation into Deadly Fire</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities are holding Jacques Moretti, the owner of a ski bar, as a potential flight risk in connection with a deadly fire that occurred on New Year’s Eve. The investigation is ongoing, with media reports highlighting the seriousness of the case as prosecutors consider charges related to the incident.</p>
<h2>Environmental Disaster in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A giant landfill collapsed in Cebu City, Philippines, resulting in one confirmed death and dozens of sanitation workers trapped under debris. Rescuers have managed to save 12 injured workers so far, but search and rescue operations continue. The incident points to concerns over safety and management at waste disposal sites in the region.</p>
<h2>International Security and Sanctions Updates</h2>
<p>In Eastern Europe, Russia carried out fresh strikes on Ukraine using the rarely deployed Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile. This was only the second time this weapon has been used since November, indicating an escalation in the conflict. Meanwhile, US officials reported the seizure of the oil tanker "Olina," which is linked to Venezuela and suspected of carrying embargoed oil. This is the fifth tanker seized, underscoring ongoing efforts to enforce international sanctions.</p>
