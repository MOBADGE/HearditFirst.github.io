    <h2>Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Large anti-government protests have taken place in Tehran and other Iranian cities. Videos show rallies held on major roads in Tehran and Iran's second-largest city. These gatherings were peaceful and were not broken up by security forces. The protests indicate ongoing public discontent, though the current situation appears stable without reported violence.</p>
<h2>Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>The Venezuelan government has started releasing political prisoners after long-standing demands from the United States, which recently captured the country’s President Nicolás Maduro. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump is seeking to buy $100 billion worth of Venezuelan oil. However, oil industry leaders, including Exxon’s chief executive, warn that Venezuela is "uninvestable" due to the government’s history of seizing assets, raising doubts about future investment and oil deals.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia has carried out fresh missile strikes in Ukraine using the Oreshnik missile, a rare hypersonic ballistic weapon. This marks only the second time Moscow has deployed this missile, which was previously used in an attack on the city of Dnipro in November. The use of such advanced missiles signals an escalation in the ongoing conflict and highlights the evolving military tactics being employed in the region.</p>
<h2>Environmental Disaster in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A giant landfill collapsed in Cebu City, Philippines, causing one death and trapping dozens of sanitation workers under debris. Rescue teams have so far pulled 12 injured workers from the rubble. The incident draws attention to the challenges and risks faced by workers in waste management and the need for improved safety measures at landfill sites.</p>
<h2>International Trade and Technology Rules</h2>
<p>After 25 years of negotiations, the European Union has reached a trade deal with South American countries. While some European farmers opposed the agreement, EU officials say their concerns have been taken into account. In related news on technology and regulation, the UK government is considering a ban on the social media platform X due to concerns over deepfake content. Officials have urged the media regulator Ofcom to consider all actions, including an effective ban, to address these risks.</p>
<h2>US-Colombia Relations</h2>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has expressed concern about a "real threat" of US military action following threats from former US President Donald Trump. Petro criticized the United States’ approach to other nations, describing it as treating them like part of a US "empire." This statement underscores tensions in US-Colombia relations amid broader regional geopolitical issues.</p>
