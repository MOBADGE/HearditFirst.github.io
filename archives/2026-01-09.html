    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Colombia's President Gustavo Petro expressed concerns about the possibility of US military action against his country, calling it a "real threat." He criticized the United States for treating other nations as part of an "empire," after former US President Donald Trump threatened Colombia with military intervention. These developments come amid wider shifts in the global order, with the US increasing its strategic assertiveness, as seen in events in Venezuela and discussions about Greenland. This places Europe and the EU in a difficult position as they consider whose influence to align with moving forward.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Protest Movements</h2>
<p>Large-scale peaceful protests took place in Tehran and other Iranian cities, with rallies on major roads including the capital and Iran's second largest city. Notably, the demonstrations were not dispersed by security forces, marking a contrast to previous unrest in the country. In the United States, protests continued for a second night across multiple cities, including Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, and Philadelphia. These protests were sparked by the killing of Renee Good, an incident involving US immigration enforcement (ICE).</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Russia launched fresh missile strikes on Ukraine using the Oreshnik missile, a hypersonic ballistic weapon rarely deployed; this marks only the second use of this missile type by Moscow since its debut strike in November on the city of Dnipro. The ongoing conflict continues to involve advanced weaponry and remains a focal point of geopolitical tension.</p>
<h2>Domestic Issues and Human Rights</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, a tragic accident unfolded when a giant landfill collapsed in Cebu City. Rescuers managed to pull 12 injured sanitation workers from the debris, but one person has died and dozens remain trapped. The incident highlights the risks faced by workers in hazardous environments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Venezuelan government has started releasing political prisoners. This move comes amid longstanding demands from the United States, which recently captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, to free detainees held for political reasons. The releases may signal a shift in Venezuela's internal politics or attempts to ease international pressure.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media Regulation</h2>
<p>In the UK, the government criticized recent changes made by Elon Musk to his AI system Grok, describing them as "insulting" to victims. This follows increasing calls from officials for the media regulator Ofcom to take strong measures against X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter. The government has urged Ofcom to consider all powers available, including an effective ban, to regulate the platform. This reflects growing concerns about content moderation and AI's role in public discourse.</p>
<h2>Trade Relations</h2>
<p>India responded strongly to claims made by the US Commerce Secretary regarding a breakdown in trade deal discussions with President Donald Trump. The Indian government called those claims "not accurate," signaling ongoing complexities in US-India trade negotiations. This exchange underscores the challenges both countries face in reaching mutual agreements amid shifting political landscapes.</p>
