    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has expressed serious concern over what he calls a "real threat" of US military action. He spoke to the BBC about tensions following threats from former US President Donald Trump concerning Colombia. Petro accused the US of treating other nations as part of an "empire," indicating a deteriorating relationship and raising fears about regional stability. Meanwhile, reactions continue in Greenland, where locals shared their perspectives on Trump's controversial threats involving the Arctic island, highlighting ongoing international unease.</p>
<h2>Middle East Protests</h2>
<p>Massive anti-government protests have taken place in Tehran and other Iranian cities. Videos show large rallies forming on major roads in Tehran, the capital, and in the country's second-largest city. Notably, the protests remained peaceful, and Iranian security forces did not disperse the gatherings. These events indicate a significant public expression of dissent, though so far without violent crackdown, suggesting a delicate situation in Iran's political landscape.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine and Russia</h2>
<p>Russia has launched fresh strikes on Ukraine using the Oreshnik missile, a rare hypersonic ballistic missile. This is only the second known deployment of this weapon after its first use against Dnipro in November. The use of such advanced military technology marks an intensification in the conflict and could impact both the military tactics adopted by Ukraine and the broader geopolitical response to Russia’s actions.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, the government has begun releasing political prisoners after prolonged demands from the United States, which recently captured the country’s President Nicolás Maduro. This step may ease some international tensions, though the situation remains complex. In India, public outrage has surged following the killing of student Anjel Chakma, spotlighting issues of racism in the country. The incident has sparked protests and renewed calls for the introduction of comprehensive anti-racism legislation.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, a tragic accident occurred when a giant landfill collapsed in Cebu City. Rescue workers have pulled 12 injured sanitation employees from the debris, but one person has died, and dozens remain trapped. Emergency efforts continue as authorities work to secure the area and assist those affected.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Australia is facing severe bushfire threats, with all regions in Victoria under "catastrophic" or "extreme" fire warnings. Residents are bracing for potential property loss and more severe consequences as the fire season intensifies, putting lives and communities at risk.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>In tennis news, Stan Wawrinka has received a wildcard to compete in the Australian Open as he enters the final season of his career. Meanwhile, Australian player Nick Kyrgios did not receive a wildcard, a decision that has drawn attention ahead of the major tournament.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories reflect ongoing conflicts, environmental challenges, social issues, and cultural moments shaping the world today. Each development has the potential to influence regional and international dynamics in the near future.</p>
