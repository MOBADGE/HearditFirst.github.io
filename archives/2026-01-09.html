    <h2>Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Large anti-government protests took place in Tehran and other Iranian cities, with people rallying on major roads in the capital and Iran’s second largest city. Videos show that these demonstrations were peaceful and were not broken up by security forces. The scale and calm nature of the protests could indicate significant public unrest while authorities appear to be maintaining restraint for now.</p>
<h2>Russian Missile Strikes in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia has launched fresh attacks on Ukraine using the Oreshnik missile, a hypersonic ballistic weapon rarely deployed before. This marks only the second known use of the missile since it was first used in November to strike Dnipro. The deployment of such advanced weaponry underscores the ongoing intensity of the conflict and may influence future military engagements between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Landfill Collapse in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A massive landfill in Cebu City, Philippines, collapsed, resulting in one confirmed death and dozens of sanitation workers trapped under debris. So far, 12 injured workers have been rescued. The incident highlights the risks associated with waste management infrastructure and the urgent need for safety measures to protect workers in similar environments.</p>
<h2>US Actions on Venezuela Oil and Sanctions</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump is seeking a $100 billion deal involving Venezuelan oil assets. However, industry executives remain cautious, with one oil executive pointing out Venezuela’s history of seizing their assets twice. In related news, US officials reported seizing a fifth oil tanker, the Olina, which is on multiple countries' sanctions lists and suspected of carrying embargoed Venezuelan oil. These developments reflect ongoing tensions over Venezuela’s oil industry and international sanctions enforcement.</p>
<h2>EU and South America Trade Agreement</h2>
<p>After 25 years of negotiations, the European Union reached a trade deal with South American countries. While some European farmers opposed the agreement, the EU Commission said it had taken their concerns into account. This long-awaited deal could boost economic ties and trade between the two regions, possibly reshaping market opportunities for industries on both sides.</p>
<h2>Potential UK Ban on Social Media Platform X</h2>
<p>The UK government has urged the media regulator Ofcom to consider using all available powers, including possibly banning the social media platform X, due to concerns over deepfake content. This move reflects growing worries about misinformation and harmful digital content on social platforms, and regulators may take further action to ensure public safety online.</p>
