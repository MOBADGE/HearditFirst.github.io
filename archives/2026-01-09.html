    <h2>Iran Protests Remain Peaceful</h2>
<p>Large anti-government protests took place in Tehran and other Iranian cities, including Iran's second-largest city. Videos show people rallying on major roads in the capital. Unlike previous demonstrations, security forces did not disperse the crowds, and the events remained peaceful. The protests reflect ongoing public dissatisfaction but also suggest a possible shift in how authorities are handling dissent.</p>
<h2>US Military Concerns and International Tensions</h2>
<p>Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, expressed concerns to the BBC about a “real threat” of US military action after former US President Donald Trump threatened intervention. Petro criticized US foreign policy, stating it treats other nations as parts of an "empire." Separately, Trump warned of further military strikes on Nigeria if violence against Christians continues, signaling ongoing security issues and potential US involvement in regional conflicts.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Struck by Rare Missile Use</h2>
<p>Russia launched fresh attacks on Ukraine using the Oreshnik missile, a rarely deployed hypersonic ballistic weapon. This was only the second documented use of this missile, which was first employed against the city of Dnipro in November. The use of such advanced weaponry marks an escalation in the ongoing conflict and could influence future military strategies.</p>
<h2>Disaster at Philippines Landfill</h2>
<p>A large collapse occurred at a private landfill site in Cebu City, Philippines, resulting in one confirmed death and dozens of sanitation workers trapped under debris. Rescue teams have managed to free 12 injured workers so far, but the situation remains dangerous. This incident highlights the risks faced by waste management workers and may lead to reassessments of landfill safety protocols.</p>
<h2>Legal Action and Regulatory Pressure</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, Jacques Moretti, owner of a ski bar, is being detained as a potential flight risk following a deadly fire on New Year’s Eve. Authorities continue to investigate the circumstances of the blaze. Meanwhile, in the UK, government ministers have urged the media regulator Ofcom to consider all options—including an effective ban—against the social media platform X, citing concerns over deepfake content proliferating on the site. This shows increasing regulatory attention on online misinformation and safety.</p>
<h2>Cultural Connections through Citizenship</h2>
<p>US actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after genetic testing connected them to African heritage. They join other American celebrities who have embraced dual citizenship as a way to reconnect with their ancestry, highlighting growing cultural and personal ties between the US and African nations.</p>
