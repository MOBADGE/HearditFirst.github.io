    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 09, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Protests and Unrest</h2>
<p>Large anti-government protests took place in Tehran and other cities across Iran. Videos shared online showed peaceful rallies occurring on major roads in the capital and in the nation's second-largest city. Notably, security forces did not disperse these gatherings. The protests reflect ongoing public dissent in Iran, although these recent demonstrations were reported as calm.</p>
<p>In the United States, protests continued for a second night in several cities, including Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, and Philadelphia. The demonstrations responded to the shooting of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Minneapolis. These events indicate sustained public concern and calls for accountability related to law enforcement actions.</p>
<h2>Tensions in the Americas</h2>
<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro expressed serious concerns about the possibility of US military action in his country. Speaking to the BBC, Petro said the US is acting as an "empire" with regard to other nations, referencing threats made by former US President Donald Trump about military intervention in Colombia. This highlights growing unease about US influence and military posturing in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Venezuelan government started releasing political prisoners. This move comes amid ongoing pressure from the United States, which recently captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and has long demanded the freedom of detainees. The releases may impact diplomatic relations and internal political dynamics in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Additionally, the US seized an oil tanker named Olina, which is linked to Venezuela and listed on sanctions lists of multiple countries. US officials suspect the vessel was carrying embargoed oil, indicating continued enforcement of sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil exports.</p>
<h2>Military Developments in Eastern Europe</h2>
<p>Russia launched fresh strikes against Ukraine using the Oreshnik missile, a rare weapon only used once before. This hypersonic ballistic missile, first deployed in November to strike the city of Dnipro, was used again in recent attacks. The use of this advanced missile underscores the intensity and evolving nature of military conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Incidents</h2>
<p>In the Philippines, a major accident occurred when a large landfill collapsed in Cebu City, resulting in one death and multiple injuries. Rescuers have so far pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the debris. The incident raises concerns about safety standards and disaster preparedness at waste disposal sites in the area.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, the owner of a ski resort, Jacques Moretti, was taken into custody following a deadly fire on New Year's Eve. Authorities consider him a potential flight risk. This case is likely to lead to further investigations into the causes and accountability for the fatal fire.</p>
<h2>Technology and Media Regulation</h2>
<p>In the UK, the government criticized recent changes to Elon Musk’s AI system called Grok, describing them as "insulting" to victims. This criticism comes as officials urge the communications regulator Ofcom to take strong action against the social media platform X, even suggesting the possibility of an effective ban. The dispute points to ongoing tensions between tech companies and governments over content moderation and AI's societal impact.</p>
