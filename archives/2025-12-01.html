    <h2>Protests in Georgia and Use of Toxic Compound</h2>
<p>An investigation by the BBC suggests that anti-government protesters in Georgia were likely exposed to camite, a toxic compound originally developed during World War One. This finding raises concerns about the use of harmful substances against demonstrators and the impact on public safety. The use of such chemicals could escalate tensions between the government and protestors and may prompt calls for independent inquiries or international attention to the methods used to control protests.</p>
<h2>US Inquiry into Alleged Military Strike in Venezuela</h2>
<p>US lawmakers from both parties have demanded clarity following media reports that the US military may have conducted a second strike on a suspected drug-trafficking boat in Venezuelan waters, potentially killing survivors. This development has initiated a bipartisan inquiry, reflecting serious concerns over military actions and the rules of engagement. The situation underscores ongoing tensions related to drug enforcement efforts and raises questions about accountability and oversight within military operations.</p>
<h2>Honduras Election and US Aid Threat</h2>
<p>Early results from Honduras’ presidential election show the candidate supported by the US president leading the race. The US president has threatened to cut aid to Honduras if his preferred right-wing candidate does not win. This stance adds pressure to the electoral process and highlights the influence of US foreign policy on Central American politics. The election outcome will be closely watched for its implications on regional stability and US-Honduras relations.</p>
<h2>Sentencing of UK MP Tulip Siddiq in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Tulip Siddiq, a UK Member of Parliament and niece of Bangladesh’s former ousted leader, has been sentenced in absentia to two years in jail by a Bangladeshi court. Siddiq has described the legal charges against her as politically motivated. This case may affect diplomatic relations between the UK and Bangladesh and raises issues about political persecution and legal fairness in Bangladesh's judicial system.</p>
<h2>Cultural Tensions Affect Japanese Performer in China</h2>
<p>Events involving a popular Japanese singer from the "One Piece" series were abruptly canceled in Shanghai amid rising tensions between China and Japan. The cancellations sparked nationalist reactions and criticism, indicating how cultural exchanges can be affected by broader political disputes. The incident reflects ongoing bilateral challenges that extend beyond politics into cultural and social arenas.</p>
<h2>India's Solar Mission to Study Sun at Peak Activity</h2>
<p>Looking ahead to 2026, India’s Sun mission, Aditya-L1, is poised to observe the Sun at the peak of its activity cycle for the first time. This mission is expected to provide valuable scientific data about solar phenomena, which could improve understanding of space weather and its effects on Earth. The upcoming milestone marks a significant step in India’s space exploration efforts and solar research.</p>
<h2>Greek Livestock Cull Raises Feta Cheese Supply Concerns</h2>
<p>Greece is conducting a large-scale cull of sheep and goats due to an outbreak of infectious disease among livestock. The reduction in these animals is causing worries about a potential shortage of feta cheese, a key Greek export and staple product. This development may affect local farmers and international markets, stressing the importance of disease control and agricultural sustainability in the region.</p>
