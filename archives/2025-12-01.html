    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 01, 2025</div>
    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has highlighted that resolving issues around Ukrainian territory remains the most difficult aspect of ongoing peace efforts. This statement comes as US envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, an adviser linked to former US President Donald Trump, are scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting on Tuesday represents a significant diplomatic effort amid ongoing tensions, with hopes that dialogue may help pave the way towards a resolution.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in the US</h2>
<p>In New Jersey, an appeals court has disqualified Alina Habba, formerly Donald Trump's personal attorney, from serving as the US Attorney for the state. This ruling prevents Habba from taking on the prosecutorial role, affecting the political and legal landscape in New Jersey. Meanwhile, in another legal proceeding, defense lawyers in an unspecified case involving a defendant named Mangione are attempting to exclude certain crucial evidence, such as a notebook and a gun. Legal commentators note that even if this bid does not succeed, the defense could still gain strategic advantages.</p>
<h2>Political Tensions in Central and South America</h2>
<p>Honduras is experiencing a closely contested presidential race. Official results show right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura leading former TV host Salvador Nasralla by a razor-thin margin of 515 votes. This technical tie means the outcome remains uncertain and could lead to further political tension in the country.</p>
<p>In Peru, rescue operations are underway after a deadly landslide struck two boats in the Ucayali region. Strong river currents have hampered efforts to find dozens reported missing. The incident adds to concerns about natural disaster risks in the region.</p>
<h2>Protests and Human Rights Concerns</h2>
<p>Evidence gathered by the BBC suggests that anti-government protesters in Georgia may have been targeted with camite, a toxic compound historically used as a chemical weapon during World War I. This raises serious questions about the treatment of demonstrators and government responses to dissent.</p>
<p>In Cameroon, the detention and death of opposition figure Anicet Ekane at the age of 74 has caused shock. His family received little explanation regarding his death, with his wife only shown his body after his passing. This event may prompt further scrutiny of political detention conditions in the country.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Security Issues</h2>
<p>Indonesia is grappling with the consequences of a cyclone that has caused severe flooding. The death toll has risen above 500, with hundreds still missing and thousands injured, highlighting the urgent need for humanitarian aid and disaster response in the region.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, recent attacks have targeted a church in the central region and a wedding party in the predominantly Muslim north. Among those abducted were a pastor and his new bride. These incidents highlight ongoing security challenges in parts of Nigeria, affecting civilian safety and community stability.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice Updates</h2>
<p>Joaquín Guzmán López, the son of the notorious drug lord El Chapo, has pleaded guilty to charges related to drug trafficking in a US court. This plea followed a previous agreement by US prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. The case underscores continuing efforts by US authorities to address international drug trafficking networks.</p>
