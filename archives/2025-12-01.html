    <h2>Protesters in Georgia Targeted with Toxic Compound</h2>
<p>A BBC investigation has found evidence suggesting that anti-government protesters in Georgia were likely exposed to a toxic chemical called camite, first used in World War I. This compound was reportedly sprayed on demonstrators during recent clashes. The use of such a hazardous substance against civilians raises significant human rights and safety concerns. Authorities and human rights groups will likely face pressure to investigate the incident and respond to potential abuses.</p>
<h2>US Congressional Inquiry into Military Strike Allegations</h2>
<p>Bipartisan US lawmakers are seeking answers following media reports that the US military may have carried out a second strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat near Venezuela, possibly killing survivors. These reports have sparked concerns about the conduct and oversight of US military operations abroad. The inquiry aims to clarify what happened and whether the military actions followed legal and ethical guidelines.</p>
<h2>Honduras Election: Early Results Favor Trump-Backed Candidate</h2>
<p>Early results from the presidential election in Honduras show the candidate supported by the US president leading. The US president has also threatened to withdraw aid to Honduras if his preferred candidate does not win. This development highlights the role of US influence in regional politics and the potential impact on Honduras’s future relationship with the US and its own political stability.</p>
<h2>UK MP Sentenced in Bangladesh Trial in Absentia</h2>
<p>Tulip Siddiq, a UK member of parliament and niece of Bangladesh’s former leader, has been sentenced to two years in jail after a trial held in her absence. Siddiq claims the charges against her are politically motivated. This case adds to the complex political dynamics between Bangladesh and its diaspora communities, and could affect diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and the UK.</p>
<h2>Japan-China Cultural Tensions Affect 'One Piece' Singer's Show</h2>
<p>A Japanese singer known for performing songs related to the popular anime "One Piece" was stopped mid-show in Shanghai amid ongoing tensions between China and Japan. The cancellation of Japanese events in the city has drawn criticism and contributed to rising nationalist sentiments. This cultural clash reflects broader political strains between the two countries and suggests potential challenges for future cultural exchanges.</p>
<h2>Greek Livestock Cull Raises Fears of Feta Cheese Shortage</h2>
<p>Greece is currently culling large numbers of sheep and goats in response to an outbreak of an infectious disease among livestock. This action has raised concerns about a potential shortage of feta cheese, a key product for Greece’s economy and culinary identity. The agricultural sector and consumers may face challenges if the cull significantly reduces milk and cheese production in the coming months.</p>
<h2>India’s Sun Mission to Witness Solar Maximum in 2026</h2>
<p>India’s space mission, Aditya-L1, will observe the Sun during its peak activity cycle in 2026 for the first time. This presents a unique opportunity to study solar phenomena in greater detail, which can improve understanding of space weather and its effects on Earth. The mission’s findings may have important scientific and practical implications for satellite operations, communication, and climate studies.</p>
