    <h2>Toxic Compound Used on Georgian Protesters</h2>
<p>A BBC investigation suggests that anti-government demonstrators in Georgia were likely sprayed with camite, a toxic chemical compound originally developed during World War I. This finding raises serious concerns about the methods used to control protests and potential human rights violations. The use of such a chemical against civilians could lead to increased domestic and international scrutiny of the Georgian authorities and demands for accountability.</p>
<h2>US Inquiry Into Alleged Military Strike in Venezuela</h2>
<p>US lawmakers from both parties have launched a bipartisan inquiry following reports that the US military might have carried out a second strike targeting survivors on a suspected drug boat near Venezuela. The reports emerged after claims made by journalist Pete Hegseth. The inquiry reflects growing concern over the conduct and oversight of US military operations abroad, particularly actions that may result in civilian casualties. Results of the investigation could affect future military engagement policies.</p>
<h2>Early Honduran Election Results and US Aid Threat</h2>
<p>Preliminary results in the Honduran presidential election show a right-wing candidate supported by the US president in the lead. The US president has warned that financial aid to Honduras could be cut if this favored candidate does not win. This development highlights US involvement in Central American politics and suggests potential shifts in US-Honduras relations depending on the final election outcome. The pressure from Washington may influence the election dynamics and Honduras’s future governance.</p>
<h2>UK MP Sentenced in Bangladesh in Absentia</h2>
<p>Tulip Siddiq, a UK Member of Parliament and niece of a former Bangladeshi leader, has been sentenced in absentia to two years in jail by a court in Bangladesh. Siddiq, a former minister, has condemned the charges as politically motivated. The sentence underscores ongoing political tensions in Bangladesh and could affect Siddiq’s international political standing and relations between the UK and Bangladesh.</p>
<h2>Japan-China Cultural Event Disruptions</h2>
<p>A Japanese singer famous for the "One Piece" theme was stopped mid-performance during a show in Shanghai. This incident is part of a broader pattern of cancellations of Japanese cultural events in China. The disruptions have sparked criticism and heightened nationalist sentiments in both countries. The cultural fallout reflects strained relations between Japan and China, which could impact future cultural exchanges and diplomatic ties.</p>
<h2>Indian Solar Mission to Observe Sun’s Peak Activity</h2>
<p>India’s Aditya-L1 solar mission is set for a significant year in 2026 as it will, for the first time, observe the Sun during its maximum activity cycle. This milestone will provide valuable scientific data on solar phenomena and help advance understanding of space weather, which has implications for communication and satellite systems on Earth. The mission represents a major step forward for India’s space research capabilities.</p>
<h2>Livestock Culling Sparks Fears Over Feta Cheese Supply in Greece</h2>
<p>An outbreak of an infectious disease in Greece has led to widespread culling of sheep and goats, raising concerns about potential shortages of feta cheese, a key Greek export product. The reduction in livestock could impact agricultural income and food supply chains within Greece and internationally. Authorities are likely to focus on controlling the outbreak to stabilize the market and prevent further losses.</p>
