    <h2>International Protests and Chemical Use</h2>
<p>A BBC investigation suggests that anti-government protesters in Georgia were likely exposed to camite, a toxic chemical compound originally developed during World War I. The use of this substance against demonstrators raises serious concerns about the methods employed to suppress protests and the potential health risks for those affected. This finding could lead to demands for accountability and further scrutiny of law enforcement tactics in the country.</p>
<h2>US Military and Venezuela Incident Under Inquiry</h2>
<p>US lawmakers from both political parties have called for answers after media reports claimed the US military conducted a second strike targeting survivors of a suspected drug boat near Venezuela. The reports have sparked concern over the legality and ethics of the operation, prompting a bipartisan inquiry to investigate the circumstances and implications. The outcome may affect military policy and transparency regarding such actions abroad.</p>
<h2>Honduran Election Influenced by US Aid Threats</h2>
<p>The presidential election in Honduras is taking place under pressure from the United States, where the US president has threatened to cut aid if his preferred right-wing candidate does not win. This move highlights the influence of foreign policy on domestic elections in Central America, raising questions about sovereignty and the potential impact on aid programs that support development and stability in Honduras.</p>
<h2>China-Japan Cultural Tensions Affect Events</h2>
<p>A popular Japanese singer known for performing the theme song of "One Piece" was abruptly stopped mid-show in Shanghai amid a broader cancellation of Japanese cultural events in the city. These cancellations are part of ongoing tensions between China and Japan, which have ignited criticism and increased nationalist sentiment on both sides. The cultural dispute illustrates how political conflicts can spill over into entertainment and public diplomacy.</p>
<h2>India’s Sun Mission Poised for Major Achievement in 2026</h2>
<p>India’s solar observation mission, Aditya-L1, is set to experience a significant milestone in 2026 when it will observe the Sun at the peak of its activity cycle for the first time. Scientists expect this will provide unprecedented data on solar phenomena, improving understanding of space weather and its effects on Earth. The mission’s progress underscores India’s growing capabilities in space research and solar science.</p>
<h2>Greek Livestock Cull Threatens Feta Cheese Supply</h2>
<p>Greece is conducting a widespread cull of sheep and goats due to an outbreak of an infectious disease. This has raised concerns over a potential shortage of feta cheese, a staple and iconic product of Greek agriculture. The cull aims to control the disease spread, but it also poses challenges for the country’s economy and food exports, possibly affecting both local consumers and international markets that rely on Greek feta.</p>
