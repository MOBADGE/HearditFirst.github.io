    <h2>Toxic Compound Used on Georgian Protesters</h2>
<p>An investigation by the BBC indicates that anti-government protesters in Georgia were likely targeted with camite, a toxic chemical compound first used during World War I. The use of such a substance against demonstrators raises serious concerns about the methods employed to control protests and the potential health risks for those exposed. Authorities have not yet commented publicly on these findings. This development may prompt international scrutiny and calls for accountability over crowd control tactics in Georgia.</p>
<h2>Severe Flooding in Indonesia</h2>
<p>The death toll from severe flooding in Indonesia has now passed 500, with another 500 people reported missing. The disaster was triggered by a cyclone that affected the region, resulting in widespread destruction. Thousands of people have been injured, and rescue efforts continue amid difficult conditions. The scale of the catastrophe highlights the vulnerability of the region to extreme weather events and the urgent need for disaster response and preparedness measures to protect communities.</p>
<h2>Inquiry into US Military Strike Claims</h2>
<p>US lawmakers from both parties have called for an investigation into recent media reports alleging that the US military conducted a second strike that killed survivors on a suspected drug boat. The initial strike targeted the vessel, but concerns have been raised about the follow-up attack on those who survived the first. The bipartisan inquiry aims to provide answers and clarify the circumstances, reflecting the sensitivity of military operations and the importance of transparency in addressing such allegations.</p>
<h2>Tight Honduran Election Race</h2>
<p>The presidential election in Honduras remains very close, with the candidate supported by the US president holding a slight lead. Meanwhile, the US president has threatened to cut aid to Honduras if his favored right-wing candidate does not win. This intervention underscores the geopolitical significance of the election for the US and raises questions about the future of US-Honduras relations depending on the outcome. The election’s knife-edge nature means tensions and scrutiny are likely to increase in the coming days.</p>
<h2>UK MP Sentenced in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Tulip Siddiq, a UK Member of Parliament and niece of Bangladesh's ousted former leader, has been sentenced to two years in jail by a court in Bangladesh following a trial held in her absence. Siddiq has stated that the charges against her are politically motivated. This case highlights ongoing political tensions within Bangladesh and could impact diplomatic relations, as well as raise issues of legal fairness and political persecution.</p>
<h2>Ukrainian President to Visit Ireland</h2>
<p>The Ukrainian president and first lady are scheduled to make their first official visit to the Republic of Ireland. This visit marks a significant diplomatic occasion, symbolizing support and strengthening relations between Ukraine and Ireland. It also reflects continued international engagement with Ukraine amid ongoing challenges. The visit may pave the way for closer cooperation and increased awareness of Ukraine’s situation in Europe.</p>
