    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 01, 2025</div>
    <h2>Legal News in the United States</h2>
<p>An appeals court has disqualified Alina Habba, who previously served as a personal attorney to Donald Trump, from holding the position of US Attorney for New Jersey. The court’s decision bars her from serving in this prosecutorial role, but further details about the reasoning were not provided in the report.</p>
<p>In a separate legal matter, the defense in a case involving Mangione is seeking to exclude key evidence, including a notebook and a gun. Legal experts suggest that even if this attempt to suppress evidence does not succeed, the defense could still benefit strategically in the ongoing proceedings.</p>
<h2>International Incidents and Conflicts</h2>
<p>New evidence suggests that anti-government protesters in Georgia were targeted with a toxic chemical called camite, which dates back to the First World War. The use of this compound raises concerns about the methods employed in suppressing demonstrations.</p>
<p>In Cameroon, there has been shock and concern following the death of Anicet Ekane, a 74-year-old opposition figure who died in detention. His lawyer reported that the family received little information, with his wife being given only the body and no explanation regarding the circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Nigeria, violent incidents continue with reports of a church raid in central Nigeria and an attack on a wedding party in the predominantly Muslim northern region. Among those abducted were a pastor and a newlywed bride, highlighting ongoing security challenges.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Humanitarian Crises</h2>
<p>Severe flooding in Indonesia has resulted in over 500 deaths, with hundreds more missing and thousands injured after a powerful cyclone struck the area. Rescue and relief operations are underway as the region copes with this major disaster.</p>
<p>Peru is also experiencing a crisis following a deadly landslide that struck two boats in the central Ucayali region. Rescue efforts have been complicated by strong river currents, and dozens of people are reported missing as a result.</p>
<h2>Criminal Justice Developments</h2>
<p>Joaquín Guzmán López, the son of the well-known drug lord El Chapo, has pled guilty in a US drug trafficking case. This plea followed an agreement from US prosecutors in which they decided not to seek the death penalty, announced earlier this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a former investment manager convicted of defrauding thousands of investors was released from prison just days into his sentence by Donald Trump. The circumstances and reasoning behind this early release were not detailed.</p>
<h2>Security and Recruitment Concerns</h2>
<p>South African authorities have charged five individuals, including a radio DJ, over a recruitment plot linked to Russia. The charges come under legislation that prohibits South Africans from joining foreign military forces, reflecting ongoing concerns about foreign influence and recruitment activities within the country.</p>
