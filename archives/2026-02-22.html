    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Security Incidents</h2>
<p>Ukraine's president spoke with the BBC in Kyiv just before the fourth anniversary of the ongoing war, stating that Russia's leader has started World War 3 and must be stopped. Meanwhile, western Ukraine experienced a terror attack overnight, with explosions killing a police officer and injuring 25 people. The violence highlights the continuing instability and human cost in the region.</p>
<h2>Security Breach at Trump Residence</h2>
<p>An armed man carrying a shotgun and a fuel can entered the secure perimeter of former U.S. President Trump's residence. Secret Service officers fatally shot the suspect. Trump was not at the location at the time of the incident, as he was in Washington DC. The circumstances around the suspect's motives have not been disclosed.</p>
<h2>Regional Military Actions and Diplomatic Tensions</h2>
<p>Pakistan launched deadly air strikes on Afghanistan, calling the military action retaliation for recent suicide bombings within Pakistan. This escalation underlines ongoing tensions between the neighboring countries.</p>
<p>In other developments involving U.S. diplomacy, an American envoy conveyed that President Trump is puzzled by Iran’s refusal to compromise despite a significant American military build-up nearby. Additionally, Greenland's prime minister rejected a U.S. offer to send a hospital ship, reminding that Greenland provides free healthcare to its residents.</p>
<h2>Middle East Diplomacy and Reactions</h2>
<p>Comments by the U.S. ambassador to Israel have drawn condemnation from various Arab and Muslim nations. The ambassador suggested that Israel might be justified in claiming much of the Middle East based on Biblical grounds, stirring diplomatic controversy.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Political Developments</h2>
<p>More than 1,500 political prisoners in Venezuela have applied for amnesty. This announcement by the head of the National Assembly follows increased U.S. pressure after the capture of ex-President Nicolás Maduro. The move may signal shifts in Venezuela’s internal political landscape.</p>
<h2>Cultural News</h2>
<p>Willie Colón, a pioneering trombonist credited with shaping salsa music over a career spanning six decades, has died at the age of 75. He was recognized as one of the most influential Latino artists of all time. In Italy, the bones of St. Francis of Assisi, the country’s patron saint, are on public display for only the second time in history, the last occasion being in 1978.</p>
