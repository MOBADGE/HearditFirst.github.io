    <h2>Ukraine Conflict and Regional Tensions</h2>
<p>Ukraine’s president spoke to the BBC from Kyiv, warning that the war with Russia, now in its fourth year, has escalated into a global crisis. He said Russian leader Vladimir Putin has effectively started a third world war and must be stopped. Meanwhile, western Ukraine experienced explosions overnight that injured 25 people and killed a police officer. Authorities described the incident as a terror attack, underscoring ongoing instability in the region.</p>
<p>In South Asia, Pakistan launched deadly strikes across the border into Afghanistan. Islamabad stated the attacks were in retaliation for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan. This development adds to the already tense security situation between the neighboring countries.</p>
<h2>United States: Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>In the US, a man armed with a shotgun and carrying fuel was killed after entering the secure perimeter of President Donald Trump’s residence. Secret Service officials confirmed Trump was in Washington, DC, at the time. The circumstances surrounding the incident are still under investigation.</p>
<p>US envoy Steve Witkoff commented on the current administration’s confusion over Iran’s response to a significant American military build-up nearby. According to Witkoff, the president is puzzled that Iran has not yet made any compromises despite the pressure.</p>
<p>Greenland’s Prime Minister rejected an offer from Trump to send a US hospital ship to the territory. The PM reminded Trump that Greenland provides free healthcare to its residents, suggesting the assistance was unnecessary.</p>
<h2>Middle East Reactions</h2>
<p>Comments attributed to US ambassador Mike Huckabee, suggesting that Israel could justify territorial claims over much of the Middle East on Biblical grounds, sparked condemnation from several Arab and Muslim countries. The remarks have heightened diplomatic tensions in a region already marked by longstanding conflict.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Political Developments</h2>
<p>Venezuela’s National Assembly leader announced that more than 1,500 political prisoners have applied for amnesty. This move comes amid growing pressure from the United States following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro. The amnesty effort may reflect efforts to ease political tensions within Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Historical Events</h2>
<p>In Italy, the bones of St Francis of Assisi, the country’s patron saint, have gone on public display. This is only the second time the relics have been shown to the public, the first occasion being a single day in 1978. The event attracts interest for its religious and cultural significance.</p>
<h2>Arts and Legacy</h2>
<p>The musical world mourned the death of Willie Colón, a trombonist regarded as one of the most influential Latino artists. His 60-year career helped pioneer salsa music and left a lasting impact through dozens of albums. Colón passed away at the age of 75.</p>
