    <h2>Regional Conflict</h2>
<p>Pakistan has launched military strikes in Afghanistan, targeting locations linked to recent suicide bombings within Pakistan. The Pakistani government described these strikes as retaliation. The Taliban, the de facto authorities in Afghanistan, reported that dozens of people were killed in the attacks. This development signals rising tensions between the two neighboring countries and could affect regional security dynamics in South Asia.</p>
<h2>Venezuelan Political Prisoners and Amnesty</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, over 1,500 political prisoners have applied for amnesty following an announcement by the head of the country's National Assembly. This move comes amid increased pressure from the United States after the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The amnesty application suggests a potential shift in Venezuela's political landscape and may affect ongoing negotiations and relations between the Venezuelan government, opposition groups, and the U.S.</p>
<h2>Lake Tahoe Avalanche Tragedy</h2>
<p>Authorities have confirmed the identities of nine people who died in what is recorded as the worst avalanche in California's history near Lake Tahoe. The victims include six women and three guides, all of whom were skiing when the disaster occurred. The final missing skier was found deceased five days after the avalanche, ending the search efforts. This tragic event has raised concerns about avalanche safety and the risks of winter sports in avalanche-prone areas.</p>
<h2>Cultural Milestone: Death of Willie Colón</h2>
<p>Willie Colón, a renowned trombonist and a pioneer of salsa music, has died at the age of 75. Over a career that spanned six decades, he released dozens of albums and was recognized as one of the most influential Latino artists. His contributions helped shape the salsa genre and cultural identity among Latino communities worldwide. His passing marks the end of an era for this popular music style.</p>
<h2>Social Change Through Sports</h2>
<p>In an Indian village, two sisters have shared how playing football has empowered them to resist forced and child marriage. This story highlights how sports can play a role beyond recreation, serving as a tool for social change and helping girls gain confidence and agency in communities where traditional practices such as early marriage persist. Initiatives like this may inspire broader efforts to protect children's rights and promote gender equality.</p>
<h2>U.S. Political Developments: Project 2025 Implementation</h2>
<p>About a year into his second term, some of the policies outlined in Project 2025 — a roadmap associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump — have been put into effect. Observers note that approximately half of the proposed measures have been implemented, covering issues ranging from Venezuela to immigration enforcement. This progress reflects ongoing political priorities and could influence the United States' domestic and foreign policies in the coming years.</p>
