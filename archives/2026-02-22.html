    <h2>Security Incident at Trump Residence</h2>
<p>An armed man was killed after he entered the secure perimeter of President Donald Trump's residence. According to the Secret Service, the suspect was carrying a shotgun and a fuel can when officers shot him. Trump was not at the residence at the time, as he was in Washington DC. Authorities have not released further details about the motive or the suspect’s identity. The incident raises concerns about security at high-profile private properties and may lead to reviews of protective measures.</p>
<h2>Pakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Escalates</h2>
<p>Pakistan launched deadly strikes on locations inside Afghanistan, stating that these actions were retaliation for recent suicide bombings occurring within Pakistan. The strikes mark a significant escalation in tensions between the two neighbors. This development could further destabilize the already fragile security situation in the region and complicate diplomatic efforts aimed at peace and cooperation.</p>
<h2>Public Display of St Francis of Assisi's Bones</h2>
<p>The bones of St Francis of Assisi, Italy’s patron saint, have been put on public display. This event is rare, as the remains have been visible to the public only once before, for a single day in 1978. The display could attract significant attention from religious followers and tourists, highlighting the cultural heritage associated with this iconic historical figure.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Tensions and US Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>US envoy Steve Witkoff reported that President Donald Trump expressed puzzlement about why Iran has not yet compromised despite a significant American military buildup nearby. This statement points to ongoing tensions between the US and Iran and suggests uncertainty in how diplomatic and military pressures are influencing Iran's decisions. The situation remains a critical element in international security concerns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Greenland, the prime minister declined the offer of a US hospital boat sent by Trump to assist people allegedly not being properly cared for. The prime minister noted that Greenland already provides free healthcare services, indicating a diplomatic rebuff of the US initiative. This response highlights Greenland’s stance on managing its own healthcare and international aid relations.</p>
<h2>Regional Political Disputes</h2>
<p>Sudan criticized Uganda for hosting Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), calling the meeting an "affront to humanity" and accusing Uganda of violating international law. This dispute underscores ongoing tensions in the region related to the RSF's controversial role and influence.</p>
<p>Separately, US ambassador Mike Huckabee faced condemnation from Arab and Muslim nations after suggesting that Israel would be justified in claiming much of the Middle East on Biblical grounds. The comments have stirred diplomatic backlash and may affect US relations with countries in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>In western Ukraine, explosions attributed to a terror attack killed a police officer and injured 25 others.</p>
<p>This incident contributes to the ongoing security challenges in the area.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, more than 1,500 political prisoners have applied for amnesty.</p>
<p>The announcement came from the head of Venezuela’s National Assembly and was made amid US pressure following the recent capture of former President Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p>This move could influence the country’s political climate and efforts towards reconciliation.</p>
<p>Finally, the Latin music world mourns the loss of Willie Colón, a pioneering trombonist who shaped salsa music over a 60-year career and was considered one of the most influential Latino artists.</p>
<p>He died at age 75.</p>
