    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 22, 2026</div>
    <h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>Mexican authorities have killed Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as "El Mencho," head of one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels. The military operation against him marks a significant moment in Mexico’s ongoing fight against major drug trafficking organizations.</p>
<p>In the United States, an armed man was killed after breaching the secure perimeter of former President Trump's residence. The suspect was reportedly carrying a shotgun and a fuel can. Trump was not at the residence at the time and was in Washington DC when the incident occurred.</p>
<h2>International Conflicts</h2>
<p>Pakistan has launched deadly strikes on Afghanistan, which its government describes as retaliation for recent suicide bombings on its soil. This development could heighten tensions between the neighboring countries and impact regional stability.</p>
<p>In western Ukraine, explosions deemed a terror attack injured 25 people and killed a police officer. Local officials are investigating the events to determine more details.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic and Political Developments</h2>
<p>The US envoy Steve Witkoff reported that former President Trump expressed puzzlement over why Iran has not made any compromises despite a significant American military buildup in the area. This indicates ongoing strain in US-Iran relations.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee’s comments suggesting Israel would be justified in taking much of the region based on Biblical grounds have been condemned by Arab and Muslim nations, reflecting tensions over statements related to regional claims.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural News</h2>
<p>Italy has put the bones of St Francis of Assisi, the country’s patron saint, on public display. This is only the second time the remains have been seen publicly, the first being in 1978. The display draws attention to Italy’s religious and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>In music, Willie Colón, a pioneering trombonist credited with shaping salsa music over a 60-year career, has died aged 75. He was considered one of the most influential Latino artists, and his passing marks the end of an era in Latin music history.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Updates</h2>
<p>Greenland’s Prime Minister declined an offer from former President Trump to send a US hospital boat to assist people he claimed were "not being taken care of," pointing out that Greenland already has a free healthcare system.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, more than 1,500 political prisoners have applied for amnesty following announcements from the head of the National Assembly. This comes amid increased US pressure after the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro, signaling potential shifts in the country’s political landscape.</p>
