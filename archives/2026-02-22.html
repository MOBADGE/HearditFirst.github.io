    <h2>Venezuela Political Prisoners Seek Amnesty</h2>
<p>More than 1,500 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty, according to the head of the country's National Assembly. This development comes amid increased pressure from the United States following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro. The move to seek amnesty could signal important changes within Venezuela's political landscape, potentially easing tensions and opening doors for dialogue after years of conflict. The situation remains fluid, and how the government responds to these applications may influence Venezuela's stability in the near future.</p>
<h2>Avalanche Tragedy in Lake Tahoe</h2>
<p>The final missing skier from a devastating avalanche in Lake Tahoe has been found dead, bringing the confirmed death toll to nine. The group consisted of six women and three guides. This avalanche is the worst recorded in the state's history, marking a tragic event for the local community and winter sports enthusiasts. Authorities are continuing to investigate the circumstances to better understand the incident and forestall similar disasters in the future.</p>
<h2>Legacy of Willie Colón, Salsa Pioneer</h2>
<p>Willie Colón, a renowned trombonist and one of the pioneers of salsa music, has died at the age of 75. His career spanned six decades and included dozens of albums. Recognized as one of the most influential Latino artists of all time, Colón's contributions helped shape the salsa genre and bring it to international audiences. His passing marks the end of an era in Latin music, but his work will continue to inspire musicians and fans worldwide.</p>
<h2>Football Empowers Girls Against Forced Marriage in India</h2>
<p>In an Indian village, football has become a powerful tool for girls combating forced and child marriage. Two sisters shared their personal stories of how playing football helped change their lives by giving them confidence and a platform to resist societal pressures. This example highlights how sports can serve as a means of empowerment and social change, offering young women alternatives to traditional roles and greater control over their futures.</p>
<h2>Implementation of Project 2025 Policies in the US</h2>
<p>Observers note that about half of the policies outlined in Project 2025, a plan associated with Donald Trump's second term, have been implemented just one year into his presidency. The project includes measures on immigration enforcement and other areas of governance. Its partial rollout reflects a continued effort to reshape policies according to this roadmap, suggesting that further changes aligned with Project 2025's goals may be forthcoming. This ongoing policy implementation may affect various sectors, including immigration and national security.</p>
