    <h2>South Asia Conflict</h2>
<p>Pakistan has launched airstrikes on locations inside Afghanistan, responding to recent suicide bombings within its borders. According to Pakistan, the strikes were a form of retaliation. The Taliban, the governing force in Afghanistan, reported that dozens of people were killed in the strikes. This escalation raises concerns about renewed instability in the region, highlighting ongoing tensions between Pakistan and militant groups operating from Afghan soil. The strikes could affect diplomatic relations and security dynamics in South Asia moving forward.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Political Developments</h2>
<p>More than 1,500 political prisoners in Venezuela have applied for amnesty amid growing pressure from the United States. This announcement came from the head of Venezuela's National Assembly shortly after the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro. The situation reflects Venezuela’s complex political landscape as international attention intensifies. The amnesty applications might lead to negotiations or political changes, but it remains unclear how Venezuelan authorities will respond or what impact this will have on the country’s future governance.</p>
<h2>Tragic Avalanche in California</h2>
<p>The search has ended for the final missing skier from the worst avalanche in California’s history near Lake Tahoe. Authorities confirmed that six women and three guides died in the incident after being caught in the snowstorm five days ago. Rescue crews have released the victims’ names as they continue to investigate the tragedy. This event underscores the dangers of backcountry skiing and may prompt renewed discussions on avalanche safety and early warning systems in the region.</p>
<h2>Cultural Loss: Willie Colón Passes Away</h2>
<p>Willie Colón, a pioneering trombonist and influential figure in salsa music, has died at age 75. His career began more than 60 years ago and included dozens of albums that helped shape and popularize Latino music globally. Colón’s work earned him recognition as one of the most influential Latino artists of all time. His passing marks the end of an era for salsa, but his legacy will continue to inspire musicians and fans around the world.</p>
<h2>Sports and Social Change in India</h2>
<p>In an Indian village, two sisters have described how playing football helped them resist the pressures of child marriage. The sport provided them with opportunities for empowerment, community support, and personal growth. Their story illustrates how grassroots sports programs can contribute to social change, especially for girls facing traditional expectations. This example highlights the potential for football and other activities to serve as tools for girls’ rights and development in similar communities globally.</p>
