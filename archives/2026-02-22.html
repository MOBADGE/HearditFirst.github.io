<p>In Ukraine, explosions overnight injured 25 people and killed a police officer in what officials are describing as a terror attack. This violent incident adds to the volatile security situation in western Ukraine.</p>
<p>Sudan sharply criticized Uganda for hosting Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group. Sudan accused Uganda of violating international law by meeting with Dagalo, highlighting tensions over regional politics and armed groups.</p>
<h2>Middle East Diplomatic Strains</h2>
<p>Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador, sparked controversy with comments suggesting Israel might be justified in claiming much of the Middle East on Biblical grounds. His remarks were condemned by Arab and Muslim nations, further complicating diplomatic relations in a sensitive region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US envoy Steve Witkoff said the president is puzzled that Iran has not yet capitulated despite a significant US military build-up nearby. This ongoing standoff reflects continuing uncertainties over Iran's response to increasing pressure.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>More than 1,500 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty, according to the head of the country's National Assembly. This move comes amid increased pressure from the United States following the recent capture of former President Nicolás Maduro, signaling potential shifts in Venezuela’s political landscape.</p>
<h2>Tragic Deaths and Losses</h2>
<p>The final missing skier from a recent avalanche in Lake Tahoe was found dead five days after the disaster, marking the resolution of the worst avalanche in the state's history. Authorities confirmed the names of all six women and three guides who lost their lives.</p>
<p>In sports, the Minnesota Vikings mourned the death of their 25-year-old receiver Rondale Moore. Tributes have been paid by the team and supporters in recognition of his life and career.</p>
<p>Additionally, Willie Colón, a pioneering trombonist and influential figure in salsa music, died at the age of 75. His six-decade career left a significant impact on Latino music and culture worldwide.</p>
<h2>Social Change Through Sport</h2>
<p>In a positive story from India, two sisters from a village shared how football has helped them resist child marriage. Their experience highlights how sports can empower girls and support social change in communities where forced marriage remains a challenge.</p>
