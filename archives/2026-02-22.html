The conflict could affect regional stability and underscores the fraught relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>More than 1,500 political prisoners in Venezuela have applied for amnesty following an announcement from the head of the country's National Assembly. This development comes amid increased pressure from the United States after the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro. The amnesty applications may signal a shift in Venezuela's political climate, though how this will impact broader political dynamics remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Tragic Avalanche in California</h2>
<p>Authorities have identified the six women and three guides who died in the deadliest avalanche in California’s history near Lake Tahoe.

<h2>U.S. Policy Direction under Trump’s Second Term</h2>
