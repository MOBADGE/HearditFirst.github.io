    <h2>Security Incident at Trump's Residence</h2>
<p>A man armed with a shotgun and carrying a fuel can was killed after entering the secure perimeter of Donald Trump's residence. The U.S. Secret Service confirmed the man was shot by officers responding to the incident. Trump was in Washington, D.C., at the time and was not in immediate danger. This event highlights ongoing security challenges faced by high-profile individuals and could prompt renewed discussions on protective measures around private residences of former political figures.</p>
<h2>Regional Conflict: Pakistan Strikes in Afghanistan</h2>
<p>Pakistan launched deadly military strikes in Afghanistan, stating that the actions were in retaliation for recent suicide bombings within its borders. The strikes further escalate tensions between the two neighboring countries and may affect regional stability. How Afghanistan will respond, and the impact on local populations, remains to be seen. This development could influence diplomatic conversations and security collaborations in the region.</p>
<h2>Cultural Event in Italy: Bones of St Francis of Assisi on Display</h2>
<p>In a rare public event, the remains of St Francis of Assisi, Italy’s patron saint, have been put on display. This is only the second known public showing of the relics, the first being a single day in 1978. The exhibition is significant for religious followers and tourists alike, offering a unique opportunity to connect with an important historical and spiritual figure.</p>
<h2>U.S. Concerns Over Iran's Stance</h2>
<p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff has shared that President Donald Trump is puzzled by Iran’s continued refusal to make concessions despite a substantial American military buildup in the region. The situation remains tense, with questions about how Iran might respond to ongoing U.S. pressure. This uncertainty continues to influence U.S. foreign policy and military planning in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>International Disputes and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Several diplomatic tensions have surfaced recently. Greenland’s prime minister rejected a U.S. offer of a hospital boat intended to aid people allegedly not receiving proper care, reminding that Greenland already has free healthcare. In another development, Sudan condemned Uganda for hosting Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, accusing Uganda of violating international law. Additionally, remarks by U.S. ambassador Mike Huckabee suggesting Israel has biblical justification for control over much of the Middle East drew strong condemnation from Arab and Muslim nations. These incidents underscore ongoing complexities in international relationships and regional politics.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Explosions in western Ukraine were reported to have killed a police officer and injured 25 people, with local officials describing the event as a terror attack. Meanwhile, over 1,500 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty amid increasing pressure from the United States following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro. In cultural news, influential salsa musician Willie Colón, known for a career spanning six decades and numerous albums, has died aged 75. His contributions are recognized as pivotal in Latino music history.</p>
