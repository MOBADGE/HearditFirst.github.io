    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine marked nearly four years of ongoing conflict as its president spoke with the BBC in Kyiv, stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin has started a global war and must be stopped. This reflects the heightened concerns about the broader implications of the war.</p>
<p>In western Ukraine, explosions led to the death of a police officer and injured 25 others. Authorities described the overnight events as a terror attack, underscoring the continued violence and instability in the region.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, Pakistan launched deadly strikes purportedly in retaliation for recent suicide bombings. This military action signals ongoing tensions between the two countries and contributes to regional insecurity.</p>
<h2>Crime and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Mexico's military reported the killing of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as "El Mencho," who was the leader of one of the country's most powerful drug cartels. This development marks a significant moment in Mexico's efforts to combat organized crime and drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, an armed man carrying a shotgun and fuel can was killed after breaching the secure perimeter of a high-profile residence. At the time, the individual who resides there was in Washington DC. The incident raised questions about security measures at the site.</p>
<h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>US envoy Steve Witkoff indicated that the US president expressed puzzlement over why Iran has not shown signs of compromise despite a major US military buildup nearby. This comment highlights ongoing tensions surrounding diplomatic and military strategies in the region.</p>
<p>Separately, Greenland's prime minister declined an offer from the former US president to send a hospital boat, noting that Greenland has free healthcare. This exchange reflects differing perspectives on aid and healthcare provision.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, comments by US ambassador Mike Huckabee suggesting that Israel could justify territorial claims in much of the region on Biblical grounds met condemnation from Arab and Muslim nations. This response points to persistent sensitivities in regional diplomacy.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Society</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, more than 1,500 political prisoners have applied for amnesty, according to the head of the country’s National Assembly. This move comes amid external pressure following the capture of ex-President Nicolás Maduro and could influence the country's political landscape.</p>
<h2>Culture and Heritage</h2>
<p>In Italy, the bones of St. Francis of Assisi have been put on public display, an event that has occurred only once before, in 1978. St. Francis is Italy's patron saint, and the display is of interest to many for its cultural and religious significance.</p>
