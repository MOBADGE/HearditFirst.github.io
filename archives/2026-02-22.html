    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 22, 2026</div>
    <h2>Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>Students in Iran staged their first large-scale anti-government protests since a deadly crackdown last month. The demonstrators gathered to honor thousands of people who were killed during nationwide protests that were suppressed by Iranian authorities. These protests signal ongoing unrest and dissatisfaction with the government, as Iranians continue to call for change despite the risks involved. The situation remains tense, and future demonstrations or government actions could affect the country's stability.</p>
<h2>Pakistan-Afghanistan Tensions</h2>
<p>Pakistan launched deadly air strikes on Afghanistan in retaliation for recent suicide bombings within its borders. The strikes reflect escalating tensions between the two neighboring countries and raise concerns about increased violence in the region. This cycle of retaliatory attacks may worsen security conditions and complicate efforts toward peace in South Asia.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Backlash Over US Ambassador's Comments</h2>
<p>Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador, faced condemnation from several Arab and Muslim nations after suggesting that Israel would be justified in taking much of the Middle East on biblical grounds. His comments have sparked diplomatic criticism, highlighting ongoing sensitivities around Middle East politics and the complex relationships between the US, Israel, and Arab countries. This controversy could influence diplomatic dialogues and complicate peace efforts in the region.</p>
<h2>Violence in Ukraine</h2>
<p>In western Ukraine, explosions killed a police officer and injured 25 people overnight. Officials are treating the incident as a terror attack. This attack underscores the continuing security challenges in Ukraine amid ongoing conflicts. Authorities are likely to increase security efforts to prevent further incidents and maintain public safety.</p>
<h2>Sudan Criticizes Uganda Over Paramilitary Leader</h2>
<p>Sudan has accused Uganda of violating international law by meeting with Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group. Sudan described Uganda's actions as an "affront to humanity." This accusation reflects regional tensions and the complex dynamics involved in Sudan's internal conflicts. The situation may affect diplomatic relations and the broader geopolitical landscape in East Africa.</p>
<h2>Amnesty Applications in Venezuela</h2>
<p>Over 1,500 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty, an announcement made by the head of Venezuela’s National Assembly. This development comes amid pressure from the United States following the recent capture of former President Nicolás Maduro. The move to grant amnesty to political prisoners could be part of efforts to ease domestic tensions and respond to international demands, potentially influencing Venezuela’s political landscape going forward.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Human Interest</h2>
<p>Two stories highlight the human and cultural aspects today. Willie Colón, a pioneering salsa trombonist, has died at age 75. His six-decade career left a significant mark on Latin music, influencing many artists worldwide. In another story, two sisters in an Indian village shared how playing football empowered them to resist forced child marriage, illustrating sports' role in social change.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accidents</h2>
<p>Authorities found the last missing skier who disappeared in an avalanche at Lake Tahoe five days earlier. The avalanche was the deadliest in the state's history, claiming the lives of six women and three guides. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Vikings mourned the death of Rondale Moore, a 25-year-old receiver, paying tribute to his memory and impact on the team.</p>
