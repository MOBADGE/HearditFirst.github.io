    <h2>Mexico's Most Wanted Drug Lord Killed</h2>
<p>Mexican authorities announced the death of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as "El Mencho," in a military operation. He led one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels, making his death a significant development in the country's ongoing fight against organized crime. The operation may impact cartel dynamics and security efforts in the region.</p>
<h2>Security Incident at Trump's Residence</h2>
<p>An armed man carrying a shotgun and a fuel can entered the secure perimeter of Donald Trump's residence. Secret Service officers responded by killing the suspect. Trump was not at the residence at the time, as he was in Washington, DC. The incident highlights ongoing security challenges faced by prominent figures.</p>
<h2>Pakistan Strikes on Afghanistan</h2>
<p>Pakistan launched deadly airstrikes on locations in Afghanistan, stating that the attacks were retaliation for recent suicide bombings within Pakistan. This escalation may affect the already fragile relations between the two neighboring countries and has the potential to increase regional tensions.</p>
<h2>Religious Relics on Display in Italy</h2>
<p>For the second time ever, the bones of St Francis of Assisi, Italy's patron saint, have been put on public display. The relics were last exhibited for a single day in 1978. This rare public viewing offers a significant cultural and religious event for many visitors and devotees.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Relations and Diplomatic Remarks</h2>
<p>US envoy Steve Witkoff reported that Donald Trump expressed puzzlement over why Iran has not yet compromised despite a large American military build-up nearby. Meanwhile, the US ambassador Mike Huckabee's comments suggesting Israel has a Biblical justification for territorial claims in the Middle East drew condemnation from several Arab and Muslim nations.</p>
<h2>Greenland Declines US Medical Aid</h2>
<p>Greenland's Prime Minister rejected an offer from Donald Trump to send a US hospital boat to the island. The Prime Minister cited Greenland's free healthcare system as sufficient for its people. This exchange underscores differing perspectives on health aid and sovereignty between Greenland and the US.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>More than 1,500 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty, an announcement made by the head of Venezuela's National Assembly. The move comes amid increased US pressure following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro, potentially signaling shifts in the country's political landscape.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, explosions believed to be terror attacks resulted in the death of a police officer and injuries to 25 people in the west of the country, raising concerns about security. Additionally, influential salsa musician Willie Colón passed away at age 75, leaving behind a legacy of over 60 years in music as one of the most important Latino artists.</p>
