    <h2>US Political Investigations and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton has appeared before a US House panel investigating Jeffrey Epstein, ending her previous refusal to testify. This panel is also interested in questioning her husband. Separately, the top Democrat on the same congressional panel has accused the US Justice Department of withholding files related to Donald Trump’s connections with Epstein. The Democrat has urged the attorney general to release the material, highlighting ongoing concerns about transparency in the investigation.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention</h2>
<p>Indirect talks between the US and Iran took place in Geneva, aiming to prevent conflict and possibly revive a nuclear deal. These negotiations are considered a last-ditch effort, but observers remain uncertain about the chances of reaching an agreement. Meanwhile, Russia has announced the exchange of more than 1,000 bodies of soldiers with Ukraine. This exchange coincides with Ukraine’s top negotiator meeting with US peace envoys in Geneva, signaling continued diplomatic efforts amid the conflict.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Denmark</h2>
<p>The Danish Prime Minister has called a snap election, focusing the campaign on the issue of Greenland. This comes amid international attention after former US President Donald Trump expressed interest in annexing Greenland. The upcoming election is expected to see extensive debate on the future of Greenland and Denmark’s relationship with the territory.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns and Legal Outcomes</h2>
<p>A controversial video has emerged showing Israeli soldiers shooting a 14-year-old Palestinian boy and standing nearby as he bled for at least 45 minutes, while Palestinian ambulances were blocked from reaching him. This incident has raised serious questions about conduct during the conflict. In Greece, four individuals have been convicted in connection with a spyware scandal involving Predator software, which was used to illegally surveil 87 people. The case, dubbed "Greece’s Watergate," has exposed significant breaches of privacy and security.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>The World Economic Forum has seen the resignation of its boss after a review revealed his communications with Jeffrey Epstein, although he stated he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal past. Cuban authorities report that a group of Cuban nationals living in the US were shot on a US-registered speedboat while allegedly planning an "armed infiltration." Lastly, archaeologists have presented evidence that the earliest writing may date back 40,000 years earlier than previously thought, with ancient objects bearing marks interpreted as early forms of written communication. This discovery could reshape understanding of human history and the development of literacy.</p>
