    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Denmark’s prime minister has called a snap election with the status of Greenland expected to be a key issue. This follows renewed international attention on Greenland after former US President Donald Trump showed interest in annexing the territory. The election campaign is likely to focus heavily on this topic, which has strategic and political implications for the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, indirect talks between the United States and Iran are taking place in Geneva. These negotiations aim to prevent potential conflict related to Iran’s nuclear program, but the prospects for reaching a new agreement remain uncertain. The talks are viewed as a critical last attempt to ease tensions.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In the ongoing Russia-Ukraine situation, Russia has announced the exchange of more than 1,000 bodies of soldiers with Ukraine. This comes as Ukrainian officials held discussions with US peace envoys in Geneva, indicating diplomatic engagement alongside the military conflict.</p>
<p>In a troubling development from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, new video footage shows Israeli soldiers shooting a 14-year-old Palestinian boy. The video also suggests that the soldiers prevented ambulances from reaching him and allowed him to bleed for at least 45 minutes before any aid was given. This incident has drawn attention to the conduct of military forces in the area.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Greece, four individuals have been convicted over the use of surveillance spyware known as Predator, in what has been described as “Greece’s Watergate.” The software was reportedly used to target 87 people, raising concerns about privacy and abuse of power.</p>
<p>In the United States, at least 10 FBI staffers have been fired for their involvement in investigations related to President Donald Trump’s handling of classified documents after his first term in office. This action reflects ongoing tensions around the investigations into Trump and decisions within the FBI.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Organizational News</h2>
<p>The head of the World Economic Forum has resigned following a review of his past communications with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. The Forum leader stated that he was “completely unaware” of Epstein’s criminal history at the time of their contact but stepped down amid the scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Regional Incidents</h2>
<p>Cuba has reported that a group of Cuban nationals living in the United States were aboard a US-registered speedboat that was shot at by Cuban authorities. The Cuban government alleges that the group was planning an “armed infiltration,” marking a serious escalation in tensions between the government and members of the Cuban diaspora.</p>
<p>In Germany, the cooling tower of the now-decommissioned Frimmersdorf power plant was demolished in a controlled collapse. This event marks a step in the country’s ongoing transition away from certain types of power generation. The demolition was observed by onlookers and is part of broader energy policy shifts.</p>
