    <h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The United States and Iran have started indirect talks in Geneva aimed at preventing further conflict and potentially reviving a nuclear agreement. These negotiations are described as a last-ditch effort, though the likelihood of reaching a deal remains uncertain. Meanwhile, in East Asia, North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un said the country could "get along" with the US if Washington accepts Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal as permanent.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions</h2>
<p>A disturbing video has emerged showing Israeli soldiers standing by while a 14-year-old Palestinian boy bled for at least 45 minutes after being shot. The soldiers also reportedly blocked Palestinian ambulances from reaching the boy. In related geopolitical tensions, Hungary’s prime minister criticized Ukraine, accusing it of enforcing an "oil blockade" after Kyiv said a key pipeline shut down following Russian strikes. Hungary recently vetoed a European Union loan to Ukraine, further complicating the situation.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>In Indonesia, a man known as the "US suitcase murderer" was deported from Bali after serving 11 years in jail. Although he has returned to the US, he still faces federal charges and is scheduled for a court appearance on Thursday.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, tycoon Jimmy Lai won an appeal against his fraud conviction, but he remains detained due to separate national security allegations.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Protests</h2>
<p>New information has come to light about a tragic incident in Kathmandu, Nepal, where 19 people were killed during protests last September. Evidence shows police gave orders that led to the shootings, with victims shot while still wearing school uniforms.</p>
<p>Separately, the internationally acclaimed Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is calling for an inquest into the death of her toddler, accusing the Nigerian hospital Euracare of negligence—a claim the hospital denies.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Apologies</h2>
<p>In Australia, the prime minister issued an apology after referring to Grace Tame, a child sex abuse survivor and advocate, as "difficult." Tame responded by saying the term is often used as a "misogynist’s code for a woman who won’t comply," highlighting ongoing sensitivities around language used toward survivors and activists.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns in the Americas</h2>
<p>The Cuban government reported that a group of Cuban nationals living in the US, traveling on a US-registered speedboat, was involved in what Cuba calls an "armed infiltration" attempt. The incident underscores continuing tensions between Cuba and groups of nationals abroad.</p>
