    <h2>Protest Killings in Nepal</h2>
<p>New evidence has emerged about the violent protests in Kathmandu last September, in which 19 people were shot dead. The BBC reports that police orders played a role in the shootings of protesters, many of whom were dressed in school uniforms at the time. This revelation sheds light on the official actions that led to the tragic loss of life during those demonstrations. The findings may prompt review of police conduct and calls for justice for the victims.</p>
<h2>Violence in Israel and Palestine</h2>
<p>A distressing video has been released showing Israeli soldiers shooting a Palestinian boy and failing to provide immediate aid. The 14-year-old was left bleeding for at least 45 minutes while ambulances were blocked from reaching him. This incident has drawn attention to the ongoing tensions and humanitarian concerns in the region, highlighting issues around military practices and the treatment of civilians during conflicts.</p>
<h2>Cuba-Cross-Border Incident</h2>
<p>Cuban authorities announced they shot dead four people on a US-registered speedboat near their territorial waters. The government stated the passengers, who were Cuban nationals living in the United States, intended to carry out an infiltration described as having "terrorist purposes." This event highlights continuing security concerns in the Caribbean and may affect diplomatic interactions between Cuba and the US.</p>
<h2>Middle East Diplomacy: US and Iran Talks</h2>
<p>The United States and Iran are engaging in indirect negotiations, aiming to revive the nuclear deal and prevent further conflict. Despite high tensions, these talks represent a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement on nuclear restrictions. The outcome remains uncertain, but successful negotiations could ease decades-long hostilities and reduce risks of escalation in the region.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Hong Kong and North Korea</h2>
<p>Tycoon Jimmy Lai, a notable figure in Hong Kong, has won an appeal against a fraud conviction. However, he remains detained on separate national security charges. Meanwhile, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un said his country could “get along” with the US if Washington accepts Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons as permanent. Both developments reflect ongoing political complexities and challenges in East Asia, with potential impacts on regional stability.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>- The Australian Prime Minister has apologized after referring to child sex abuse survivor and advocate Grace Tame as "difficult." Tame called the term a “misogynist’s code for a woman who won’t comply,” highlighting sensitivities around language and respect for survivors.
  
- A journalist recounted a harrowing night when a mob burned the Daily Star newspaper building, trapping 28 staff on the roof.</p>
<p>This incident underscores continued threats to press freedom and safety for journalists in some regions.</p>
<p>- A man dubbed the "US suitcase murderer," who had spent 11 years in jail in Bali, has been deported to the United States, where he faces federal charges and a court appearance scheduled for this week.</p>
