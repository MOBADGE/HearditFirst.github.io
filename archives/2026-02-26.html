    <h2>Danish Election Called with Greenland Issue in Spotlight</h2>
<p>Denmark's prime minister has announced a snap election, putting the future of Greenland at the center of the campaign. The debate is particularly significant because of former US President Donald Trump's past interest in annexing Greenland. This development highlights Greenland's growing geopolitical importance and could influence Denmark's domestic politics and its relations with the US and other global powers.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Nuclear Talks Show Progress but Outcome Uncertain</h2>
<p>Indirect talks between the US and Iran in Geneva have ended, with mediators reporting "significant progress." These negotiations are viewed as a last-ditch effort to revive a nuclear agreement, but it remains unclear whether a deal will be reached. The talks are critical for regional stability and international non-proliferation efforts and will likely continue to draw close attention from global leaders.</p>
<h2>Greece Spyware Scandal Leads to Convictions</h2>
<p>Four individuals have been convicted in connection with a major spyware scandal in Greece, often referred to as the country's "Watergate." The scandal involved the use of the Predator surveillance software to target 87 people. The convictions mark an important step in addressing abuses of surveillance technology and restoring trust in the country's institutions.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns as Palestinian Boy Dies After Shooting</h2>
<p>Video footage has emerged showing Israeli soldiers shooting a 14-year-old Palestinian boy and then standing around as he bled to death. According to reports, Palestinian ambulances were blocked for at least 45 minutes while the boy lay injured. This incident raises serious humanitarian and ethical concerns and is likely to intensify scrutiny of conduct during conflicts in the region.</p>
<h2>Cuba Reports Armed Infiltration Attempt via US-Registered Boat</h2>
<p>The Cuban government has stated that a group of passengers, all Cuban nationals living in the US, were involved in an attempted armed infiltration aboard a US-registered speedboat. Cuban authorities responded by shooting at the group, underscoring ongoing tensions between Cuba and its diaspora as well as security concerns in the Caribbean region.</p>
<h2>FBI Dismisses Agents Linked to Trump Document Investigation</h2>
<p>At least ten FBI agents who worked on an investigation into former US President Donald Trump's handling of classified documents after his first term have been fired. The reasons for these dismissals have not been detailed, but the action reflects ongoing internal issues within the FBI related to high-profile political investigations.</p>
<h2>Russia and Ukraine Exchange Soldiers' Bodies Amid Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Russia has announced the exchange of over 1,000 bodies of soldiers with Ukraine. This development comes as Ukraine’s chief negotiator met with US peace envoys in Geneva. The exchange is a rare humanitarian step in the ongoing conflict and may be a precursor to further discussions aimed at conflict resolution.</p>
