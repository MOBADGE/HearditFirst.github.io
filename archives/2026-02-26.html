    <h2>Violence and Unrest in Nepal and the Middle East</h2>
<p>New evidence has emerged regarding the shooting deaths of 19 people during protests in Kathmandu, Nepal, last September. The BBC report reveals police orders were a key factor leading to the deadly outcome involving members of Generation Z demonstrating in their school uniforms. This sheds light on state responses to youth protests and may influence how future demonstrations are managed.</p>
<p>In the West Bank, video footage shows Israeli soldiers firing at a 14-year-old Palestinian boy and allowing him to bleed for at least 45 minutes while blocking ambulances. This incident highlights ongoing tensions and humanitarian concerns in the region. It has drawn attention to the conduct of Israeli forces during clashes and could impact international scrutiny and calls for accountability.</p>
<h2>Regional Security and International Talks</h2>
<p>Cuba announced it shot dead four people traveling on a US-registered speedboat, stating the passengers were Cuban nationals living in the US who planned a terrorist infiltration. This incident underscores continuing security challenges faced by Cuba in controlling unauthorized maritime incursions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, indirect talks between the US and Iran have begun, seen as a crucial attempt to avoid conflict. These negotiations focus on nuclear issues, though prospects for a renewed nuclear agreement remain uncertain. The talks reflect ongoing diplomatic efforts to manage tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Developments in Europe and Asia</h2>
<p>Hungary’s prime minister has accused Ukraine of imposing an “oil blockade” following Kyiv’s announcement that a key pipeline was shut down due to Russian strikes. This accusation came after Hungary vetoed an EU loan to Kyiv, revealing fractures within European responses to the conflict in Ukraine. The situation may affect regional energy supplies and EU-Ukraine relations.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, businessman Jimmy Lai won an appeal against a fraud conviction, though he remains detained on a separate national security case. His legal battles continue to draw attention to Hong Kong’s evolving judicial and political climate.</p>
<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stated that North Korea could “get along” with the US if Washington accepts that Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons are permanent. This statement suggests a potential opening for dialogue framed by acceptance of North Korea's nuclear status, which could influence future diplomatic engagement.</p>
<h2>Justice and Human Rights Issues</h2>
<p>The man known as the “suitcase murderer” was deported from Bali to the US after serving 11 years in jail there. At 33 years old, he is expected to face federal charges and will appear in court shortly. This case emphasizes international cooperation in criminal justice.</p>
<p>In Australia, the prime minister apologized after describing Grace Tame, a child sex abuse survivor and advocate, as “difficult.” Tame responded by calling the wording a “misogynist’s code for a woman who won’t comply.” The incident highlights ongoing societal discussions around language, respect for survivors, and gender dynamics in public discourse.</p>
<h2>Renewed Concerns in Ethiopia</h2>
<p>There are growing fears that conflict may resume in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, more than three years after the civil war ended. Increasing numbers of people are fleeing the area, raising concern over possible renewed violence. The situation remains fluid and could have significant humanitarian implications if fighting restarts.</p>
