    <h2>Elections and Greenland Dispute in Denmark</h2>
<p>Denmark's Prime Minister has called a snap election, with the future of Greenland emerging as a central issue. Greenland has attracted international attention after Donald Trump expressed interest in annexing the territory. This development is expected to shape election debates and public opinion in Denmark as parties present their positions. The outcome could influence Denmark's policies toward Greenland and international relations concerning the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>Developments in the Epstein Investigation</h2>
<p>Two major updates have emerged in the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has agreed to appear before a House panel examining the case, reversing her previous refusal. Her husband, former president Bill Clinton, has also been asked to cooperate. Separately, the top Democrat on the same congressional panel has accused the US Justice Department of withholding files related to Epstein and President Donald Trump. The Democrat has urged the attorney general to release these materials, emphasizing the need for transparency.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Negotiations in Geneva</h2>
<p>The United States and Iran are engaged in indirect talks in Geneva aimed at preventing military conflict. These discussions represent a crucial attempt to revive or create a nuclear agreement, though the likelihood of reaching a deal remains uncertain. The talks are seen as a last effort to ease tensions between the two countries, which could have significant implications for regional stability and international diplomacy.</p>
<h2>Military and Human Rights Issues in the Middle East</h2>
<p>New evidence has emerged of a troubling incident involving Israeli soldiers and a Palestinian boy. Video footage shows Israeli forces firing on a 14-year-old Palestinian and then blocking ambulances as he lay wounded for at least 45 minutes. This incident raises serious human rights concerns and may impact ongoing conflicts and diplomatic efforts in the region.</p>
<h2>International Exchanges and Conflict Resolution Efforts</h2>
<p>Russia and Ukraine have exchanged more than 1,000 soldiers' bodies amid ongoing conflict. This announcement coincides with Ukraine’s top negotiator meeting with US peace envoys in Geneva, signaling continued efforts to seek resolutions in the war. These exchanges and diplomatic engagements reflect the complex and ongoing struggle to manage and resolve hostilities.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Greece, four individuals have been convicted related to a spyware scandal involving Predator software, which was used to target 87 people. This case attracted comparisons to the Watergate scandal due to its scale and political impact.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have found possible evidence of the earliest known writing, potentially dating back 40,000 years, which would considerably extend the timeline for the development of written communication by Stone Age humans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the head of the World Economic Forum has resigned following a review of his past communications with Jeffrey Epstein. Although he denied knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities at the time, the resignation underscores ongoing sensitivities around Epstein-linked figures.</p>
<p>Finally, Cuba reported that a group of Cuban nationals living in the US, found on a US-registered speedboat, planned an "armed infiltration." Cuban authorities detained the group near Cuban waters, adding tension to US-Cuba relations.</p>
<p>These developments reflect a wide range of political, legal, and historical issues shaping the global news landscape today.</p>
