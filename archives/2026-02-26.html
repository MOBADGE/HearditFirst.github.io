    <h2>Danish Election Called with Greenland Issue in Focus</h2>
<p>Denmark's prime minister has called a snap election, with the future of Greenland expected to be a key topic in the campaign. This comes amid reports that Donald Trump has expressed interest in annexing Greenland. The issue is likely to shape political debates in Denmark as parties outline their positions ahead of the vote. The election outcome may influence Denmark’s approach to Greenland's status and international relations around the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>US and Iran Seek to Avoid Conflict Through Talks</h2>
<p>Indirect negotiations between the US and Iran are taking place in Geneva in an effort to prevent further conflict. These talks are considered a last-ditch attempt to reach a nuclear agreement, although the likelihood of success remains uncertain. The discussions underscore ongoing international concerns about nuclear proliferation and efforts to stabilize relations in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Spyware Scandal in Greece Leads to Convictions</h2>
<p>Four individuals have been convicted in connection with a major spyware scandal in Greece, known locally as "Greece’s Watergate." The surveillance software called Predator was reportedly used to target 87 people, raising concerns about privacy and government overreach. The convictions mark a significant step in addressing abuses related to this scandal.</p>
<h2>Controversy Over Incident Involving Palestinian Boy</h2>
<p>A video has emerged showing Israeli soldiers standing near a 14-year-old Palestinian boy who was bleeding after being shot. The scene lasted at least 45 minutes during which Palestinian ambulances were blocked from reaching him. This incident has drawn attention to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian issues in the region.</p>
<h2>Cuba Reports Armed Infiltration Attempt</h2>
<p>Cuban authorities say they fired on a US-registered speedboat carrying Cuban nationals living in the United States. The Cuban government described the event as an attempted "armed infiltration." Details about the passengers and the incident highlight continuing tensions and security concerns related to Cuba’s borders.</p>
<h2>Other Developments</h2>
<p>- The head of the World Economic Forum resigned following a review into links with Jeffrey Epstein. The official acknowledged communications with Epstein but stated he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal past.</p>
<p>- In Germany, the cooling tower of the decommissioned Frimmersdorf power plant was demolished in a controlled collapse observed by onlookers, marking a step in the site’s closure process.</p>
<p>- The German political party AfD praised a temporary court injunction preventing it from being labeled as "extremist," a ruling its co-leader called a "major victory."</p>
<p>- The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has fired at least 10 staffers connected with the investigation into Donald Trump’s handling of classified documents after his first term.</p>
<p>- Russia and Ukraine have exchanged the bodies of more than 1,000 soldiers amid ongoing conflict. This military development coincided with Ukraine’s top negotiator meeting with US peace envoys in Geneva to discuss diplomatic efforts.</p>
