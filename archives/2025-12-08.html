<p>In London, Volodymyr Zelensky and the leaders of France, Germany, and the UK met to discuss efforts by the United States to end the war in Ukraine. The talks focused on increasing security guarantees for Ukraine as it continues to face military challenges. Meanwhile, European leaders are attempting to balance their support for Ukrainian sovereignty with maintaining a working relationship with former US President Donald Trump, highlighting the complex political dynamics surrounding the conflict and continental stability.</p>
<h2>Tensions at the Thai-Cambodia Border</h2>
<p>At least five people have died in recent clashes between Thailand and Cambodia near their border, the most serious confrontation since July.

<h2>Political Unrest in Benin</h2>

<h2>Major Earthquake Strikes Japan</h2>

<h2>Legal and Cultural Developments</h2>

Meanwhile, in Brazil, a library was robbed in broad daylight, with thieves stealing eight artworks by Henri Matisse, an act that draws attention to cultural security and the illicit art market.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>

Additionally, the social media platform X, owned by Elon Musk, banned the European Commission from advertising after being fined €120 million by EU regulators over deceptive advertising related to verification badges. Lastly, in Australia, a man was found guilty of murder after hiding in India for several years; the case involved the discovery of Toyah Cordingley’s body by her father in 2018.</p>
