    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 17, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
<p>The US president has announced plans to impose 10% tariffs from February on several European allies who oppose his initiative to purchase Greenland. European leaders have described the threatened tariffs as “unacceptable.” This move signals rising tensions in transatlantic relations and could affect trade and diplomatic cooperation between the United States and European nations.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>In Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly acknowledged that thousands have been killed in recent protests. While he described some of the deaths as “inhuman” and “savage,” he attributed blame to the United States. Meanwhile, in Syria, the army has moved east of Aleppo following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces. This shift follows the Syrian government’s first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since 1946, marking a notable change in government policy toward Kurdish populations.</p>
<h2>Gaza Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>A peace panel established by the US president is working on addressing the complex situation in Gaza. Despite significant challenges and widespread concerns, the peace plan remains the primary framework for resolving the conflict. Several world leaders have pledged their support for the initiative, underscoring its importance in international efforts to bring stability to the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political News in the United States and Uganda</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, a US judge has issued a legal order restricting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responses to planned protests and counter-protests amid ongoing immigration enforcement operations. This move aims to manage tensions and maintain public order during the weekend demonstrations.</p>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has secured a seventh term after winning a contested election. His main opponent, Bobi Wine, has disputed the results, describing them as “fake.” The extension of Museveni’s 40-year rule raises questions about the future political landscape in the country.</p>
<h2>Science, Technology, and Public Safety</h2>
<p>A new study has affirmed that paracetamol is safe to use during pregnancy, refuting previous claims linking the drug to autism. Researchers say their rigorous review should put an end to ongoing debates about the common painkiller’s safety for pregnant people.</p>
<p>In the technology sector, Google is appealing a landmark antitrust verdict that requires the company to implement court-ordered changes aimed at limiting its search engine monopoly. The company seeks a pause on these fixes as legal proceedings continue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Austrian Alps, avalanches linked to heavy snowfall have resulted in the deaths of five off-piste skiers this week. This tragic spate of incidents highlights ongoing risks for winter sports enthusiasts in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Japan, Yokohama’s mayor, Takeharu Yamanaka, has apologized after admitting to using derogatory language, including calling staff “idiot” and “human scum.” His remarks have sparked local controversy and raised concerns about leadership conduct.</p>
