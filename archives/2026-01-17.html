    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 17, 2026</div>
    <h2>Middle East Unrest and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has openly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during the recent protests that began in late December. He accused the United States of instigating the unrest. The protests reflect ongoing tensions in the region and highlight concerns about human rights and political stability in Iran.</p>
<p>In Syria, the government’s forces have moved east of Aleppo following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces. This shift comes shortly after Syria formally recognized Kurdish national rights for the first time since 1946, a significant development that could affect the dynamics of power and ethnic relations within the country.</p>
<h2>Gaza Peace Initiative Advances</h2>
<p>The White House has announced the members of the "founding executive board" for the US president’s peace plan for Gaza. Notable figures include the former UK prime minister Tony Blair and former US secretary of state Marco Rubio. This "Board of Peace" will oversee the next phase of the peace efforts aimed at resolving ongoing conflicts in the region. Their involvement could influence diplomatic approaches and international support in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Political Controversies and Elections in Africa</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has been declared the winner of a contested election, securing a seventh term in office. His main opponent, Bobi Wine, has challenged the results, calling them "fake." Museveni’s extended rule, now lasting over four decades, raises questions about democratic processes and political opposition in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Guinea, junta leader Mamadi Doumbouya is poised to transition from military to civilian leadership with a new seven-year term. He now faces the challenge of proving his ability to lead democratically after years of military control, marking a pivotal moment for Guinea’s political future.</p>
<h2>US Justice Department Investigates Minnesota Democrats</h2>
<p>The US Justice Department has started an investigation into Minnesota Democrats over allegations they obstructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This comes amid new details about the death of a Minneapolis woman who was shot last week by an ICE agent in the city. The case has sparked debate over law enforcement and immigration enforcement policies in the United States.</p>
<h2>Public Health and Corporate Legal News</h2>
<p>A new study has reaffirmed that paracetamol is safe to use during pregnancy, contradicting previous claims linking the painkiller to autism. Researchers described this review as gold-standard, hoping it will settle ongoing concerns about medication use in pregnancy.</p>
<p>In a separate development, Google is appealing a landmark antitrust verdict that ordered changes to limit its monopoly power in internet search. The company is seeking to pause these court-ordered fixes as it challenges the ruling, a case that will have significant implications for the technology sector and competitive practices online.</p>
<h2>Local Leadership and Apologies</h2>
<p>In Japan, Yokohama’s mayor, Takeharu Yamanaka, publicly apologized after admitting to using harsh language, including calling staff "idiot" and "human scum." This admission followed internal criticism and highlights issues of conduct and leadership style within local government.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These developments highlight ongoing political tensions, legal battles, and shifts in leadership around the world, with potential impacts on international relations and domestic governance in various countries.</p>
