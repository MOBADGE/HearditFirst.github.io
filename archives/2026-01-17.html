    <h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>In Syria, the government has moved its army east of Aleppo following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces. This shift in control comes after Syria’s government formally recognized Kurdish national rights for the first time since 1946, a notable development in the region’s longstanding ethnic and political tensions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine’s port city of Odesa is experiencing heavy shelling as part of ongoing Russian attacks. The offensive aims to weaken Ukraine's morale by targeting critical infrastructure and civilian areas, adding to the country’s challenges amid the conflict.</p>
<h2>Iran Protest Aftermath</h2>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged that thousands of people have died during recent protests. While he described some of these deaths as “inhuman” and “savage,” he placed blame on the United States for the unrest. This public admission highlights the severe toll of the protests and underscores ongoing political tensions within Iran and between Iran and the US.</p>
<h2>Political Leadership Changes in Africa</h2>
<p>In Uganda, Yoweri Museveni has extended his 40-year rule by winning a seventh term as president. The election was contested, with his main rival, Bobi Wine, accusing the process of producing “fake results.” This outcome continues Museveni’s long tenure in power despite opposition challenges.</p>
<p>In Guinea, Mamadi Doumbouya, the former military junta leader, has officially transitioned to civilian president and is beginning a seven-year term. His leadership will now be tested on the democratic stage after years in military command.</p>
<h2>International Peace Efforts in Gaza</h2>
<p>A peace panel led by former US President Donald Trump, involving well-known figures, is attempting to address the complex situation in Gaza. Despite facing huge challenges, this peace plan remains the primary initiative supported by many world leaders. The effort reflects ongoing international attempts to resolve the Gaza conflict, though significant obstacles remain.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Austria, avalanches triggered by heavy snowfall have killed five off-piste skiers, part of a series of fatal accidents in the Alps over the past week. Authorities continue to warn about the dangers of skiing in certain areas under these conditions.</p>
<p>A new study has concluded that paracetamol is safe for use during pregnancy, contradicting past claims linking it to autism. Researchers hope the findings will end debates over the common painkiller’s safety for expectant mothers.</p>
<p>In Japan, Yokohama mayor Takeharu Yamanaka publicly apologized after admitting he called municipal staff “idiot” and “human scum,” phrases that caused controversy and calls for his accountability.</p>
<p>Finally, Google is appealing a landmark antitrust ruling that ordered changes to its search operations aimed at curbing monopoly power. The company is seeking to delay the implementation of these court-mandated fixes, which could have significant consequences for the tech industry and market competition.</p>
