    <h2>US Justice Department Probes Minnesota Democrats</h2>
<p>The US Justice Department is investigating some Minnesota Democrats over allegations that they obstructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This inquiry comes amid new details about the recent death of a woman in Minneapolis who was shot by an ICE agent. The investigation focuses on whether actions by certain Democrats impeded ICE’s work, though specific details have not been fully disclosed. This development may have political and legal implications for those involved and could influence ongoing debates over immigration enforcement in the US.</p>
<h2>Study Finds Paracetamol Safe During Pregnancy</h2>
<p>A new comprehensive study has confirmed that paracetamol, a widely used painkiller, is safe to use during pregnancy. This gold-standard review aimed to put an end to concerns and debates sparked by earlier claims linking paracetamol use to autism risk in children. The findings are expected to reassure pregnant individuals and healthcare providers, supporting continued use of paracetamol to manage pain and fever without fear of harm to the unborn child.</p>
<h2>Uganda Election Update: Museveni Leads</h2>
<p>In Uganda’s ongoing election, President Museveni is heading toward victory with about 75% of votes counted from over half of the polling stations. His main rival has raised concerns about the election process, crying foul over what appears to be a wide margin of lead. The results so far suggest Museveni will secure another term, though the allegations by the opposition highlight tensions and questions about electoral fairness that may affect the country's political climate.</p>
<h2>Intense Attacks on Odesa Amid Ukrainian Conflict</h2>
<p>The Ukrainian port city of Odesa, the country’s third largest, is under heavy attack from Russian forces targeting its sea ports. These sustained assaults aim to undermine morale and disrupt supply lines. Families in the city are attempting to flee the bombardment as the situation remains volatile. The attacks on Odesa represent a continuation of the conflict in Ukraine, with significant humanitarian consequences and strategic importance for both sides.</p>
<h2>Guinea’s Junta Leader Plans Transition to Civilian Presidency</h2>
<p>Mamadi Doumbouya, the leader of Guinea’s military junta, is poised to become the country’s civilian president with a seven-year term ahead. Having previously held power in a military capacity, he now faces the challenge of proving himself as a democratic leader. This transition marks a critical point for Guinea, as Doumbouya must gain legitimacy in the eyes of the public and international observers while managing expectations of democratic governance after a period of military rule.</p>
