    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 17, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>The US president has threatened to impose 10% tariffs starting in February on several European allies who oppose his plan to purchase Greenland. European leaders have called this tariff threat "unacceptable." Meanwhile, a panel led by the US focusing on peace in Gaza faces significant challenges, but it remains the primary initiative on the table. Many world leaders have expressed support for this US-led peace plan.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has acknowledged that thousands were killed during recent protests, describing some of the deaths as “inhuman” and “savage.” However, he attributed the unrest partly to interference by the US. In Syria, the government has recognized Kurdish national rights for the first time since 1946. Following this announcement, Syrian government forces moved east of Aleppo after Kurdish forces withdrew from the area.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Issues</h2>
<p>A US judge has limited the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in response to Minneapolis protests planned for the weekend. The restrictions come amid ongoing immigration enforcement activities and anticipated counter-protests in the city.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Africa</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has secured a seventh term in office after a contested election. His main opponent, Bobi Wine, has denounced the results as "fake." This victory extends Museveni’s rule to more than 40 years.</p>
<h2>Science and Health</h2>
<p>A new study has confirmed that paracetamol is safe for use during pregnancy. The researchers conducted a comprehensive review designed to resolve ongoing debates, including claims previously made that linked the drug to autism. Their findings aim to reassure pregnant women about the common painkiller’s safety.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>In Austria, heavy snowfall has led to avalanches that killed five off-piste skiers in the Alps over the past week. In Japan, the mayor of Yokohama, Takeharu Yamanaka, apologized after admitting to calling staff “idiot” and “human scum.” Lastly, Google is appealing a landmark antitrust ruling and is seeking to pause court-ordered changes intended to limit its monopoly power in the search engine market.</p>
