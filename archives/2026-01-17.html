    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 17, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has accused the United States of instigating recent protests in Iran that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of people. This allegation underscores continuing tensions between Iran and the US amid domestic unrest.</p>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has secured a seventh term after a contested election. Museveni, who has been in power for 40 years, is set to extend his rule amid claims of election fraud. His main challenger, Bobi Wine, described the results as "fake," highlighting political divisions in the country.</p>
<p>In Syria, the government army has taken control east of Aleppo following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces. This development follows the Syrian government's first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since 1946, signaling a shift in the complex dynamics of the Syrian conflict.</p>
<h2>Peace Efforts in Gaza</h2>
<p>The White House announced the formation of a "Board of Peace" to oversee the next phase of a US-led peace plan for Gaza. The founding executive board includes notable figures such as former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and former US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This board aims to guide efforts towards stability in the region, reflecting ongoing international attempts to address the Gaza conflict.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>The US Justice Department is investigating Minnesota Democrats for allegedly obstructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This inquiry follows new information related to the death of a Minneapolis woman who was shot last week by an ICE agent, a case that has drawn significant attention to immigration enforcement policies and their consequences.</p>
<p>Separately, Google is appealing a major antitrust ruling that imposes court-ordered changes intended to limit its monopoly power over search engines. Google is seeking a halt to these measures as it challenges the verdict, highlighting ongoing legal battles over tech company market dominance.</p>
<h2>Health Research</h2>
<p>A new study has affirmed that paracetamol is safe to use during pregnancy, countering earlier claims that linked the common painkiller to autism. Researchers describe their gold-standard review as conclusive, potentially ending debates and concerns about the medication’s effects on fetal development.</p>
<h2>Leadership and Accountability</h2>
<p>In Japan, Takeharu Yamanaka, mayor of Yokohama, issued an apology after admitting to calling city staff derogatory names including "idiot" and "human scum." This incident raises questions about leadership conduct and workplace culture in public office.</p>
<p>In Guinea, junta leader Mamadi Doumbouya is preparing to transition from military to civilian president for a seven-year term. His challenge will be to establish democratic governance following years of military rule, marking a critical period for the country's political future.</p>
