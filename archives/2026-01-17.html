    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 17, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Trade Tensions</h2>
<p>The US president has announced plans to impose a 10% tariff starting in February on several European allies who have opposed his administration's efforts to purchase Greenland. European leaders have called the tariff threat "unacceptable," highlighting ongoing tensions between the US and its European partners over trade and territorial issues. This development may strain transatlantic relations and could impact trade negotiations moving forward.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>The Syrian army has advanced east of Aleppo following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces. This shift comes shortly after the Syrian government issued its first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since 1946, a noteworthy political move in the region. Meanwhile, a US-backed peace initiative for Gaza faces significant challenges, but remains the only active plan, attracting pledges of support from several world leaders despite the complexities involved.</p>
<h2>Iran's Response to Protests</h2>
<p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has acknowledged that thousands were killed during recent protests, describing some of the deaths as “inhuman” and “savage.” However, he attributed much of the unrest to interference by the United States. This admission adds a layer of complexity to the ongoing situation in Iran and may affect diplomatic relations and international responses to the protests.</p>
<h2>US Legal and Political News</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, a US judge has restricted the actions of immigration enforcement agency ICE in response to upcoming protests and counter protests scheduled for the weekend. The legal order aims to balance immigration enforcement with public order during a period of heightened local tensions.</p>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has claimed victory in a contested election that grants him a seventh term in office. His main challenger, Bobi Wine, has criticized the outcome, describing the results as "fake." This election prolongs Museveni's 40-year rule and raises questions about the future political landscape in Uganda.</p>
<h2>Science and Technology Updates</h2>
<p>A new study has confirmed that paracetamol is safe to use during pregnancy, countering previous concerns, including assertions linked to autism risks. Researchers described the review as "gold-standard," aiming to settle the debate and reassure expectant mothers and healthcare providers.</p>
<p>In technology, Google has appealed a landmark antitrust ruling that ordered the company to make changes to limit its monopoly power in search. The tech giant is seeking to pause these court-ordered fixes, prolonging a high-profile legal battle that will have implications for competition in the digital marketplace.</p>
<h2>Regional News</h2>
<p>Heavy snowfall has resulted in several avalanches in the Austrian Alps, leading to the deaths of five off-piste skiers. This comes amid a severe weather period affecting the region, underscoring ongoing safety concerns for winter sports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>In Japan, the mayor of Yokohama, Takeharu Yamanaka, has publicly apologized after acknowledging that he used harsh language to criticize city staff, including calling them "human scum" and "idiots." The apology may impact his political standing and relations with municipal employees.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These developments highlight key political, social, and environmental challenges around the world, with potential impacts on international relations, public safety, and governance.</p>
