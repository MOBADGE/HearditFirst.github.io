    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The US president has announced a plan to impose 10% tariffs from February on several European allies that oppose his plan to buy Greenland. European leaders have described this tariff threat as "unacceptable," highlighting tensions between the United States and its European partners over this proposal.</p>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has won a contested seventh term in office, extending his 40-year rule. His main rival, Bobi Wine, has described the election results as "fake," raising concerns about the legitimacy of the poll.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Syria's government has taken a significant step by formally recognizing Kurdish national rights for the first time since 1946. Following this, the Syrian army has moved east of Aleppo after Kurdish forces withdrew from the area, marking a notable development in the region's complex dynamics.</p>
<h2>Middle East Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>A US-led peace panel that includes major international figures faces substantial challenges in seeking progress in Gaza. Despite numerous concerns and complexities surrounding the situation, this panel remains the only active peace plan. Many world leaders have pledged their support, underscoring global interest in finding a resolution to ongoing conflicts in the area.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Protests</h2>
<p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests. He described some of these deaths as "inhuman" and "savage" but attributed responsibility to the United States. This admission comes amid continuing tensions over the country's internal unrest.</p>
<p>In the United States, a judge has issued legal restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions in Minneapolis ahead of planned weekend protests and counter-protests. These events are occurring amid ongoing enforcement actions, reflecting the continuing national debate over immigration policy and civil rights.</p>
<h2>Health Research</h2>
<p>A new study has found that paracetamol (acetaminophen) is safe to use during pregnancy, contradicting previous claims — including those raised by former US President Donald Trump — suggesting a link to autism. Researchers described their review as "gold-standard," aiming to settle the debate over the painkiller’s safety for pregnant women.</p>
<h2>Environment and Accidents</h2>
<p>Heavy snowfall in the Alps has contributed to a series of avalanches, resulting in the deaths of five off-piste skiers in Austria. This is part of a string of fatal incidents in the region over the past week, highlighting the dangers of winter sports under severe weather conditions.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Political Accountability</h2>
<p>Yokohama's mayor, Takeharu Yamanaka, has publicly apologized after admitting to insulting his staff with derogatory terms such as "idiot" and "human scum." This has drawn attention to leadership conduct and workplace culture in local government.</p>
<p>In the tech industry, Google is appealing a landmark antitrust verdict that imposed court-ordered measures to reduce its monopoly power over online search. The company is seeking to pause the implementation of these measures, which could have wide-ranging effects on how internet services are regulated and compete.</p>
