    <h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged that thousands of people have died during recent protests in the country. He described some of the deaths as “inhuman” and “savage,” but also blamed the United States for the unrest. Meanwhile, in Syria, government forces have moved east of Aleppo following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces. This shift comes after the Syrian government formally recognized Kurdish national rights for the first time since 1946.</p>
<h2>Efforts to Address the Gaza Conflict</h2>
<p>The White House announced the creation of a "Board of Peace" aimed at dealing with the situation in Gaza. The founding executive board includes notable figures such as former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Despite significant challenges, this initiative is regarded as the primary international plan addressing the crisis, with various world leaders expressing support for it.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Issues</h2>
<p>The US Justice Department is investigating some Democrats in Minnesota over allegations of obstructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This inquiry comes as new details surfaced about the recent shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent. The incident has sparked controversy and added tension to the investigation.</p>
<h2>Political Update from Uganda</h2>
<p>Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni has won a seventh term in office after a highly contested election. His main opponent, Bobi Wine, rejected the results as "fake," raising questions about the legitimacy of the poll. Museveni’s continued rule extends his leadership to 40 years.</p>
<h2>Other Global News</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, the city of Odesa, known as the country’s third-largest, is experiencing ongoing attacks on its ports by Russian forces. The bombardments are seen as an attempt to weaken morale. In Japan, Yokohama’s mayor, Takeharu Yamanaka, apologized after admitting to calling his staff "idiot" and "human scum," drawing criticism for his remarks.</p>
<h2>Science and Technology</h2>
<p>A recent study has found that paracetamol is safe to use during pregnancy, countering previous claims linking it to autism. Researchers describe their review as gold-standard and hope it will settle the ongoing debate over the medication’s safety. In technology news, Google has appealed a major antitrust verdict that seeks to limit its search engine monopoly, asking for a pause on court-ordered remedies aimed at curbing its market power.</p>
