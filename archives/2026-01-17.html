    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The US president has threatened to impose 10% tariffs starting in February on several European allies opposing his plans to purchase Greenland. European leaders have called this tariff threat "unacceptable." Meanwhile, the US has formed a peace panel to address the complex situation in Gaza. Despite many challenges, this remains the primary plan for peace, with support pledged by several world leaders.</p>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has secured a seventh term following a contested election. His main rival, Bobi Wine, has accused the election of producing "fake results." This extends Museveni's four decades in power, further consolidating his long-standing rule.</p>
<p>In Syria, the government has advanced east of Aleppo after Kurdish forces withdrew. This follows a historic announcement from Syria’s leadership recognizing Kurdish national rights for the first time since 1946, marking a significant development in the country's internal dynamics.</p>
<h2>Middle East and Human Rights</h2>
<p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has addressed recent protests in the country, acknowledging that thousands of people were killed. He described some of these deaths as “inhuman” and “savage” but placed blame for the unrest on the United States. The protests and government response remain a critical and sensitive issue in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues in the US</h2>
<p>A US judge has issued legal restrictions on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency's response to planned protests and counter-protests in Minneapolis. This order arrives amid ongoing immigration enforcement actions and aims to regulate ICE’s conduct during the anticipated demonstrations over the weekend.</p>
<h2>Technology and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Google is appealing a major antitrust ruling that would have imposed court-mandated changes to reduce its search engine monopoly. The company seeks to pause these imposed fixes while the appeal is reviewed, a case that carries significant implications for tech regulation in the US and globally.</p>
<h2>Health and Science</h2>
<p>A new comprehensive study has confirmed that paracetamol is safe to use during pregnancy, countering previous claims, including those made by former US president Donald Trump, linking its use to autism. Researchers describe this review as "gold-standard," hoping it will settle ongoing debates about the common painkiller's safety for expecting mothers.</p>
<h2>Weather and Safety</h2>
<p>Heavy snowfall in the Alps has led to a deadly week, with avalanches killing five off-piste skiers in Austria. The extreme winter conditions have raised concerns about safety in the region for ski enthusiasts and residents.</p>
