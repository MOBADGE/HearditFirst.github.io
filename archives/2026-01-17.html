    <h2>US Justice Department Investigates Minnesota Democrats</h2>
<p>The US Justice Department is looking into claims that some Minnesota Democrats may have obstructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This investigation coincides with new details in the case of a Minneapolis woman who was recently shot and killed by an ICE agent. The developments raise concerns about the interaction between local political figures and federal immigration enforcement, as well as the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting. How the investigation unfolds could impact relations between local authorities and federal agencies.</p>
<h2>New Study Finds Paracetamol Safe During Pregnancy</h2>
<p>A recent thorough scientific review has concluded that paracetamol, a widely used painkiller, is safe to use during pregnancy. The study aims to address ongoing concerns and debates, including claims linking its use to autism, which were previously promoted by some public figures. These findings offer reassurance to pregnant women about the safety of this common medication, potentially influencing healthcare advice and prenatal care practices going forward.</p>
<h2>Uganda Election Update: President Museveni Leads</h2>
<p>Uganda’s President Museveni is heading toward a strong victory in the recent election, having secured approximately 75% of the vote from over half of the polling stations counted. However, his main rival has raised allegations of wrongdoing in the electoral process. The outcome is likely to solidify Museveni’s extended time in office, but questions about the election’s fairness may lead to political tension and challenges within Uganda’s political landscape in the near future.</p>
<h2>Continued Shelling in Odesa Amid Conflict</h2>
<p>Odesa, Ukraine’s third largest city, is facing ongoing attacks targeting its port facilities as part of sustained Russian military operations. These bombardments appear aimed at undermining civilian morale and disrupting Ukraine’s access to maritime trade routes. The situation continues to place residents and families in difficult conditions as they seek safety. The conflict’s persistence in this key city highlights ongoing instability and humanitarian concerns in the region.</p>
<h2>Guinea’s Junta Leader Prepares to Transition to Civilian Presidency</h2>
<p>In Guinea, Mamadi Doumbouya, who led the military junta, is preparing to take on the role of civilian president with a planned seven-year term. This transition marks a significant shift from military to civilian rule, though Doumbouya faces the challenge of proving his commitment to democratic governance. How he manages this change will be critical for Guinea’s political future and its relationship with the international community.</p>
<h2>Armed Group Robs Pokémon Store in New York City</h2>
