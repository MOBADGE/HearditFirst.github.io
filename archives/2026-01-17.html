    <h2>Middle East Unrest and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has acknowledged that thousands of people have been killed during recent protests in the country. While condemning some of the deaths as “inhuman” and “savage,” he placed blame on the United States for the unrest. This admission marks a rare official recognition of the scale of violence during the demonstrations, which have drawn international concern.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new peace initiative aimed at resolving the Gaza conflict has been announced with senior figures named to its leadership. Among those on the “founding executive board” are former UK prime minister Tony Blair and former US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Despite the complex and deeply entrenched challenges in Gaza, this is currently the main plan supported by many world leaders. The group faces significant hurdles given the difficult political landscape, but their involvement signals ongoing global efforts to find a path to peace.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Syria and Ukraine</h2>
<p>In Syria, government forces have advanced east of Aleppo following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces. This movement comes after the Syrian government formally recognized Kurdish national rights for the first time since 1946, a significant political development in the country’s long-standing ethnic and territorial issues.</p>
<p>Further north in Ukraine, the city of Odesa continues to endure sustained attacks on its ports amid ongoing conflict. The Russian military is intensifying its bombardment in an apparent effort to undermine Ukrainian morale. Civilians in Ukraine’s third-largest city are trying to escape the barrage, underscoring the ongoing humanitarian challenges of the conflict.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Uganda and the United States</h2>
<p>Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni has secured a seventh term in office after winning a contested election. His main rival, Bobi Wine, has rejected the results as "fake," highlighting ongoing tensions and disputes over the country’s electoral process.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Justice Department has opened an investigation into Minnesota Democrats over allegations of obstructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This inquiry coincides with new details emerging about the recent death of a Minneapolis woman who was shot by an ICE agent, drawing attention to the highly charged political climate surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>
<h2>Health and Technology Updates</h2>
<p>A new study has found that paracetamol (acetaminophen) is safe for use during pregnancy, contradicting previous claims linking it to autism. Researchers highlighted the robustness of their review, describing it as “gold-standard,” and hope it will settle ongoing debates about the medication’s safety for expectant mothers.</p>
<p>In the technology sector, Google is appealing a major antitrust verdict that aims to restrict its dominant position in internet search. The company is seeking to delay court-ordered changes designed to limit its monopoly power, signaling that the legal battle over control of search markets will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h2>Local Leadership and Accountability</h2>
<p>In Japan, the mayor of Yokohama, Takeharu Yamanaka, has apologized after admitting to calling municipal staff derogatory names, including “human scum” and “idiot.” His public apology aims to address the backlash following his harsh language, reflecting heightened attention to leadership conduct and workplace respect in public institutions.</p>
