    <h2>Middle East Unrest and Diplomatic Efforts</h2>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has acknowledged that thousands of people have been killed during recent protests in the country. He described some of these deaths as “inhuman” and “savage” but attributed the unrest to interference from the United States. This admission comes amid ongoing tensions and highlights the depth of the crisis inside Iran.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, efforts to broker peace in Gaza are taking shape under a plan endorsed by several world leaders. Despite numerous challenges faced by key figures working on the initiative, it remains the primary framework for resolving the conflict. The international backing reflects the urgency and global interest in stabilizing the region.</p>
<h2>Military and Political Developments in Syria and Ukraine</h2>
<p>In Syria, government forces have moved into the area east of Aleppo following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces. This shift coincides with the Syrian government's recent formal recognition of Kurdish national rights, a significant step given it is the first such acknowledgment since 1946. The development may signal changing dynamics in the long-standing conflict there.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the city of Odesa has endured continuous shelling targeting its ports, as Russian forces aim to break local morale. With Odesa being Ukraine’s third-largest city, these attacks underscore the intensity of the conflict and its impact on civilian populations.</p>
<h2>Political Changes in Africa</h2>
<p>Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has secured a seventh term in office after a recently contested election. His main opponent, Bobi Wine, has disputed the results, describing them as "fake." Museveni's extended rule, now over 40 years, raises questions about the political future and stability of Uganda.</p>
<p>In Guinea, junta leader Mamadi Doumbouya has transitioned from military rule to becoming the civilian president, with a seven-year term ahead. Doumbouya faces the challenge of establishing democratic governance after a period of military control, marking a critical juncture for Guinea’s political landscape.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues in the United States and Japan</h2>
<p>A US judge has issued restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions in Minneapolis ahead of planned protests and counter-protests. This legal order signals court involvement in balancing immigration enforcement with public order concerns in the city.</p>
<p>In Japan, Yokohama’s mayor, Takeharu Yamanaka, apologized after admitting to calling city staff "idiot" and "human scum." The comments have drawn attention to workplace conduct and leadership accountability in public administration.</p>
<h2>Health and Technology Updates</h2>
<p>A new study on the safety of paracetamol use during pregnancy has been published, countering previous claims linking the drug to autism risks. Researchers emphasize their review as a definitive contribution to the debate, reassuring pregnant women and healthcare providers about the medication’s safety.</p>
<p>In the technology sector, Google is appealing a major antitrust judgment that required it to implement measures to curb its dominance in search services. The company seeks a delay in enforcing these court-ordered changes, highlighting ongoing legal battles over monopoly concerns in the tech industry.</p>
