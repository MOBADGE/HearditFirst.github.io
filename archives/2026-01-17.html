    <h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged that thousands of people have been killed during recent protests in the country. He described some of the deaths as “inhuman” and “savage,” but blamed the United States for the violence. Meanwhile, in Syria, the government forces moved east of Aleppo after Kurdish forces withdrew. This shift follows Syria’s government formally recognizing Kurdish national rights for the first time since 1946, marking a significant political development in the region.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>In Gaza, prominent figures involved in former US President Donald Trump's peace panel are facing significant challenges amid the ongoing conflict. Despite the difficulties, this peace plan remains the main option under consideration, with support pledged by many global leaders. At the same time, the Ukrainian city of Odesa is enduring heavy shelling by Russian forces targeting its ports, in what is seen as an effort to undermine morale. Families are trying to escape the Russian bombardment as the situation remains tense.</p>
<h2>Political Updates</h2>
<p>In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni secured a seventh term in office following a contested election. His main opponent, Bobi Wine, has challenged the results, calling them “fake.” Museveni’s extended rule now spans over 40 years, highlighting ongoing political controversies in the country.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues in the US and Japan</h2>
<p>A US judge has issued a legal order restricting the response of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to protests planned in Minneapolis over the weekend. This comes ahead of anticipated demonstrations related to immigration enforcement actions. In Japan, the mayor of Yokohama, Takeharu Yamanaka, apologized after admitting to insulting city staff by calling them “idiot” and “human scum.” The comments have sparked criticism and brought attention to workplace conduct.</p>
<h2>Health and Technology News</h2>
<p>A new scientific study has affirmed that paracetamol is safe to use during pregnancy, addressing ongoing debates caused by previous claims linking the drug to autism. Researchers described their findings as gold-standard evidence that should end concerns over its use. In the technology sector, Google is appealing a major antitrust ruling that ordered the company to make changes aimed at reducing its monopoly over internet searches. The company is seeking to delay or pause these court-ordered fixes while the appeal process unfolds.</p>
<h2>Weather and Safety</h2>
<p>The Austrian Alps have been hit by heavy snowfall, contributing to a series of avalanches over the past week. These avalanches have resulted in the deaths of five skiers who were off-piste, highlighting ongoing risks in the region as winter conditions persist.</p>
