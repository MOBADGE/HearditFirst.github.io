    <h2>Fire in Hong Kong Tower Blocks</h2>
<p>A large fire broke out in Wang Cheong House, a residential tower block in Hong Kong, on Wednesday. Video footage shows how quickly the blaze spread. Dozens of people have died, and hundreds are still missing as firefighters continue their search amid the devastation. The incident has raised urgent concerns about building safety and emergency response in densely populated urban areas.</p>
<h2>Tensions in Ukraine-Russia Relations</h2>
<p>In Moscow, Vladimir Putin has intensified demands for Ukrainian territory ahead of scheduled talks with the US. He accused Kyiv of wanting to fight "to the last Ukrainian," a stance he says Russia is also prepared to match "in principle." This exchange highlights the ongoing high tensions and the challenging diplomacy efforts surrounding the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Shift in France’s Military Policy</h2>
<p>France announced it will reinstate a form of military service 25 years after phasing out compulsory conscription. President Emmanuel Macron said, "The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it," emphasizing the need for readiness amid global security concerns. The new program aims to strengthen national defense and prepare young citizens for future challenges.</p>
<h2>Continued Conflict in Lebanon</h2>
<p>A year after a ceasefire agreement, peace remains elusive in southern Lebanon. Israel continues strikes citing Hezbollah’s attempts to recover militarily from previous conflict. This ongoing low-level violence underscores the fragile nature of peace in the region and the difficulties in sustaining long-term conflict resolution.</p>
<h2>Pope’s Visit to Turkey Highlights Global Conflict Risks</h2>
<p>Pope Leo made his first foreign trip to Turkey, where he warned that the future of humanity is at stake due to ongoing conflicts. He described a third world war being "fought piecemeal," pointing to the widespread and interconnected nature of current global tensions. His visit brings attention to the urgent need for peace and dialogue on the international stage.</p>
