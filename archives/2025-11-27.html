    <h2>Fire in Hong Kong Tower Blocks</h2>
<p>A fast-moving fire broke out in the Wang Cheong House tower blocks in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Dozens of people have died, and hundreds remain missing as firefighters continue their search efforts. Video footage verified by the BBC shows how quickly the blaze spread through the buildings. The scale of the disaster has raised concerns about fire safety and emergency response in densely populated urban areas. Recovery and investigation efforts are ongoing.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Afghan Immigration Requests</h2>
<p>Following a shooting incident in Washington involving an alleged gunman who is an Afghan national, US authorities have temporarily suspended immigration requests for Afghans. The suspect entered the United States in September 2021. This move may affect many Afghan nationals seeking asylum or other immigration benefits amid ongoing security reviews.</p>
<h2>France Reintroduces Military Service</h2>
<p>France plans to bring back a form of military service 25 years after conscription was phased out. President Emmanuel Macron stated, "The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it." The reintroduction aims to improve national security and readiness in a context of increasing global uncertainties. Details on how the new service will operate have yet to be fully announced.</p>
<h2>Guinea-Bissau’s New Leadership After Coup</h2>
<p>A day after a military coup in Guinea-Bissau, General Horta N’Tam was sworn in as the country’s leader during a ceremony at army headquarters. This development follows the recent political upheaval and marks a new phase for the nation’s governance. The international community is closely watching Guinea-Bissau’s next steps toward stability and democratic processes.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Bans Six Major Airlines</h2>
<p>In response to escalating tensions with the United States, Venezuela has banned six major airlines from flying to the country. These carriers had stopped services following US warnings about heightened military activity in the region. The ban is part of broader strained relations and may impact travel and commerce between Venezuela and the affected countries.</p>
<h2>Peace Challenges in South Lebanon</h2>
<p>One year after a ceasefire agreement, peace remains elusive in South Lebanon. Israeli forces continue to carry out strikes targeting Hezbollah, which Israel says is trying to recover from a previous conflict. The ongoing clashes underscore persistent instability in the region despite ceasefire efforts, raising concerns about potential renewed violence in the near future.</p>
