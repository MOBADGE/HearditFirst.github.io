    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>A deadly fire broke out on Wednesday in the Wang Cheong House tower block in Hong Kong. Dozens of people have died, and hundreds remain missing as firefighters continue their search and rescue efforts. Video footage verified by the BBC shows how quickly the fire spread throughout the building. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about fire safety in densely populated urban housing.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin has reiterated demands for Ukrainian territory ahead of scheduled talks with the United States in Moscow. Putin accused Kyiv of being willing to fight "to the last Ukrainian," and said Russia is also prepared to continue fighting "in principle." This escalation adds tension to the complex diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the conflict.</p>
<h2>Palestinian-US Teen Released from Israeli Jail</h2>
<p>Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American, was released after spending nine months in an Israeli prison. He was arrested while on holiday from Florida, accused of throwing rocks at Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. His release may affect ongoing discussions about detention and treatment of minors in the region.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Suspension for Afghans</h2>
<p>The United States has temporarily suspended immigration requests for Afghans following a shooting incident in Washington. The alleged shooter is an Afghan national who arrived in the US in September 2021. This move reflects heightened security concerns and may impact Afghan immigration processes in the near term.</p>
<h2>France to Reinstate Military Service</h2>
<p>France plans to reintroduce a form of national military service 25 years after ending conscription. President Emmanuel Macron stated that “the only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it,” signaling a shift in defense policy amid evolving security challenges. This decision may shape the future of France’s military and youth programs.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Bans Major Airlines Amid Tensions</h2>
<p>In response to escalating tensions with the United States, Venezuela has banned six major airlines. These airlines had stopped flying to Venezuela following US warnings about increased military activity. This development marks a significant moment in the strained relations between the two countries, possibly affecting travel and diplomacy.</p>
