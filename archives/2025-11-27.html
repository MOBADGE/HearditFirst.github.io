    <h2>International Security and Conflicts</h2>
<p>A year after a ceasefire was declared in southern Lebanon, tensions remain high as Israel continues to carry out strikes. These attacks target what Israel says are efforts by Hezbollah to rebuild following their recent war. The ongoing violence highlights the fragile nature of peace in the region and suggests continued instability for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In West Africa, soldiers in Guinea-Bissau have seized power and detained the president. This military takeover occurred while the country was awaiting election results from the weekend vote. The development raises concerns about the democratic process and political stability in the country.</p>
<h2>United States and Immigration</h2>
<p>The United States has suspended immigration requests for Afghans following a shooting incident involving the National Guard in Washington. The alleged shooter is an Afghan national who entered the US in September 2021. This move indicates tightened scrutiny and potential delays in immigration for Afghans amid security concerns.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic and Religious Engagements</h2>
<p>Pope Leo has arrived in Turkey on the first foreign trip of his papacy. During his visit, he will meet with leaders of various Christian traditions in Nicaea and celebrate Mass in Beirut. This visit is significant for fostering inter-Christian dialogue and reinforcing religious ties in the region.</p>
<h2>Energy and Economy in Latin America</h2>
<p>Argentina is experiencing an oil and gas boom driven by fracking, which has notably transformed one town. The country hopes this surge in energy production will bring broader economic benefits nationwide. This development could impact Argentina’s energy landscape and economic prospects in the long term.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Venezuela has banned six major airlines after those carriers stopped flying to the country. The flight suspensions followed US warnings of increased military activity. These escalating tensions affect air travel and could have broader implications for Venezuela’s connectivity and international relations.</p>
<h2>Regional Protests and Political Reactions</h2>
<p>In Georgia, mass protests continue one year after the prime minister paused efforts for the country to join the European Union for four years. Demonstrators vow to keep resisting, reflecting ongoing public frustration with government decisions on foreign policy and integration.</p>
<p>South Africa has responded strongly after former US president Trump stated that the US would not invite South Africa to the G20 summit next year. The US had previously boycotted the Johannesburg summit over claims of white minority persecution, widely viewed as discredited. This exchange reveals strains in US-South Africa relations amid differing political positions.</p>
