    <h2>Deadly Fire in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>At least 65 people have died and hundreds are missing after a major fire engulfed tower blocks in Hong Kong, marking the city's worst fire in 70 years. The blaze took hold rapidly, as shown in video footage from Wang Cheong House, where the fire spread quickly. Authorities have arrested three people and launched a corruption investigation related to the incident. The scale of the tragedy has raised urgent questions about building safety and emergency response in Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Political Changes in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>A day after a coup, General Horta N’Tam was sworn in as the new leader of Guinea-Bissau during a ceremony held at the army headquarters. This leadership change follows unrest in the country and could have significant implications for its political stability moving forward.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Afghan Immigration Requests</h2>
<p>The US government has suspended immigration requests for Afghans following a shooting incident in Washington linked to an Afghan national who entered the country in September 2021. This decision reflects heightened security concerns and may impact broader immigration and refugee policies affecting Afghan nationals in the US.</p>
<h2>France Introduces New Military Service</h2>
<p>France plans to implement a new form of military service, 25 years after phasing out conscription. President Emmanuel Macron stated, "The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it," signalling a focus on national security amid international uncertainties. Details about the nature and scale of this military service are expected to emerge as the rollout progresses.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Bans Six Major Airlines</h2>
<p>Venezuela has banned six major international airlines after tensions with the US escalated. The carriers had stopped flying to Venezuela following US warnings about increased military activity in the region. This ban further restricts travel and reflects heightened diplomatic strains between Venezuela and the United States.</p>
<h2>Continuing Conflict in South Lebanon</h2>
<p>One year after a ceasefire, peace remains elusive in south Lebanon as Israel continues airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. Israel says the strikes aim to disrupt Hezbollah’s efforts to rebuild after their previous conflict. The ongoing military actions highlight the fragile security situation in the region and the challenges to maintaining lasting peace.</p>
