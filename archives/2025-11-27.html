    <h2>Hong Kong Fire Tragedy</h2>
<p>A major fire has engulfed tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 65 deaths and hundreds of people reported missing. The blaze severely affected Wang Cheong House, where footage shows the fire spreading rapidly. This incident is described as the city's worst fire in 70 years. Authorities have arrested three people and launched a corruption probe related to the fire. The investigation may provide further information about causes and accountability as efforts to find those missing continue.</p>
<h2>Tensions Within the United States</h2>
<p>The US has suspended immigration requests for Afghan nationals following a shooting incident in Washington. The alleged gunman is reported to be an Afghan national who entered the US in September 2021. This development comes amid broader concerns over security and immigration policies. Further updates may clarify how this suspension will impact immigration processes concerning Afghan applicants.</p>
<h2>Military Service Returns to France</h2>
<p>France announced it will introduce a new form of military service, 25 years after phasing out conscription. President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the need for preparation to avoid future dangers. Details about the program’s structure, requirements, or timeline have yet to be fully outlined. This marks a significant shift in France’s defense policy and may influence youth engagement and national security planning.</p>
<h2>Political Change in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>In Guinea-Bissau, a general named Horta N’Tam has been sworn in as the new leader following a coup that took place just a day prior. The ceremony was held at the army headquarters. This rapid leadership change follows a period of political instability. Observers will be watching for how this transition affects governance, stability, and relations with other countries.</p>
<h2>Regional Conflicts and International Relations</h2>
<p>One year after a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, the area remains unstable as Israel continues strikes targeting Hezbollah’s rebuilding efforts. This ongoing military activity highlights the fragility of peace in the region. Separately, Venezuela has banned six major airlines from operating within its borders after the US issued warnings of increased military activity. The airlines had stopped flying to Venezuela amid these heightened tensions, further complicating international travel and diplomatic relations in the region.</p>
