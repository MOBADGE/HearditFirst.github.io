    <h2>Fire in Hong Kong Tower Blocks</h2>
<p>A major fire has engulfed tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in at least 55 deaths and leaving hundreds more reported missing. Authorities have arrested three people in connection with the fire and launched a corruption investigation. This blaze is reported as the worst in Hong Kong in 70 years. The incident raises concerns about building safety and regulatory oversight in the city.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Afghan Immigration Requests</h2>
