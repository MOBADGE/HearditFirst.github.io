    <h2>Devastating Hong Kong Tower Fire</h2>
<p>Firefighters in Hong Kong continue to search for hundreds of people still missing after a large fire engulfed the Wang Cheong House tower blocks on Wednesday. Dozens have been confirmed dead in the blaze. Videos verified by the BBC show how quickly the fire spread through the buildings, complicating rescue efforts. The full extent of the tragedy is still unfolding as emergency teams work tirelessly to find survivors and account for the missing.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions and Conflict Updates</h2>
<p>In the Middle East, violence and military actions continue despite recent ceasefires. In southern Lebanon, Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Hezbollah, which Israel says is rebuilding its capabilities following past conflicts. These ongoing strikes highlight the fragile situation a year after the ceasefire was established.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Mohammed Ibrahim, a Palestinian-US teenager, was released after nine months in Israeli detention. He was arrested while on holiday in Florida on allegations related to protests involving settlers.</p>
<p>Separately, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated his harsh stance ahead of talks with US officials in Moscow, accusing Kyiv of wanting to fight "to the last Ukrainian." He stated that Russia is also prepared for a prolonged conflict under such terms.</p>
<h2>US and Immigration Concerns</h2>
<p>The United States is suspending immigration requests from Afghan nationals following a shooting incident in Washington attributed to a gunman who entered the country in 2021. This move reflects heightened security concerns linked to the incident.</p>
<h2>Policy Changes in France and Venezuela</h2>
<p>France announced it will introduce a form of military service, reviving a practice that ended 25 years ago. President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the need for preparedness to avoid future dangers, signaling a shift in national defense and civic engagement policies.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, authorities have banned six major airlines from operating in the country. This decision followed heightened tensions with the US, including warnings of increased military activity in the region. The affected airlines had already stopped flights amid the escalating political climate.</p>
<h2>Economic and Global Perspectives</h2>
<p>Argentina is experiencing a local transformation due to fracking and hopes that the associated oil and gas boom will bring widespread benefits to the nation. The development offers potential for energy and economic growth amid global shifts in resource demand.</p>
<p>On the international stage, Pope Leo made his first foreign trip to Turkey, warning that the future of humanity is at stake due to ongoing conflicts. He described a third world war taking place in gradual, dispersed battles, underlining the urgency of peace efforts worldwide.</p>
