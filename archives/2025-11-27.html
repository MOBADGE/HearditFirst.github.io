Dozens of people have died, and hundreds remain missing as firefighters continue their search and rescue efforts. Video footage verified by BBC shows the fire spreading quickly through the building, highlighting the speed and intensity of the blaze.

<h2>Rising Tensions in Ukraine-Russia Talks</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated strong demands concerning Ukrainian territory ahead of upcoming talks with US officials in Moscow.

The remarks come at a time of ongoing diplomatic efforts to address the war in Ukraine, underlining the challenges in reaching a peaceful resolution.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Afghan Immigration Requests</h2>
<p>Following a shooting incident in Washington involving an Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021, US authorities have suspended immigration requests from Afghan nationals. The move reflects increased scrutiny of immigration procedures amid security concerns. Officials are reviewing circumstances around the incident to determine appropriate next steps while managing community safety and immigration policy.</p>
<h2>France Reintroduces Military Service</h2>
<p>France is set to reintroduce a form of military service, more than two decades after conscription was phased out.

Details on how this service will operate are expected to emerge as the government moves forward with implementation plans.</p>
<h2>Political Changes in Guinea-Bissau</h2>

The international community and local stakeholders will be watching closely to see how this transition affects governance and stability in Guinea-Bissau.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Conflict and Peace Challenges in Lebanon</h2>
<p>A year after a ceasefire was declared in southern Lebanon, conflict continues as Israel persists with strikes targeting what it describes as Hezbollah's recovery efforts from the recent war. Despite the ceasefire, tensions remain high in the region, complicating prospects for lasting peace. These ongoing hostilities underscore the fragility of the current situation and the need for further diplomatic engagement.</p>
<h2>Pope's Message on Global Conflict</h2>
<p>Pope Leo, on his first foreign trip to Turkey, highlighted the precarious state of global peace. He warned that the future of humanity is at risk due to conflicts that he described as a "piecemeal" form of a third world war.
