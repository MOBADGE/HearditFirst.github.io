    <h2>Major Fire in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>A severe fire broke out in an apartment block at Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong, killing at least 44 people. The fire took local authorities 18 hours to bring under control. Over 800 firefighters were involved in battling the blaze, which continued well into the morning after it started. This tragedy highlights the ongoing challenges of urban fire safety and emergency response in densely populated cities.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>In Guinea-Bissau, the military has seized power and detained the president. This takeover occurred as the country awaited the results of a recent election held on Sunday. The military's actions introduce uncertainty about the nation's political future and may affect regional stability in West Africa.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions in South Lebanon</h2>
<p>A year after a ceasefire, Israeli military strikes continue in southern Lebanon. Israel states these operations target Hezbollah's attempts to rebuild and rearm after their recent conflict. The ongoing hostilities have disrupted life in the region, breaking long-held views of security among the local population. The situation remains tense, with potential implications for broader regional peace.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Pause Following Shooting</h2>
<p>The United States has suspended immigration requests for Afghans following a shooting incident in Washington. The alleged gunman in the incident is an Afghan national who entered the country in September 2021. This pause affects ongoing immigration processes for Afghans and raises concerns about security and immigration policy.</p>
<h2>Economic Prospects in Argentina</h2>
<p>Argentina is experiencing an oil and gas boom due to increased fracking activity, particularly benefiting one local town. The country hopes this energy growth will extend its economic benefits nationwide. The development of this sector could play a key role in Argentina’s future economic landscape, balancing environmental concerns and energy needs.</p>
<h2>Protests and Political Challenges in Georgia</h2>
<p>In Georgia, protests continue one year after the prime minister announced a four-year halt to efforts toward European Union membership. Demonstrators remain determined to sustain their resistance despite government opposition. This ongoing unrest reflects deep divisions over the country's direction and its relationship with Europe.</p>
