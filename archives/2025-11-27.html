    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Fire</h2>
<p>Firefighters continue to search for hundreds of people still missing following a devastating fire at the Wang Cheong House tower blocks in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Dozens of people have died in the blaze. Video footage verified by BBC shows how rapidly the fire spread through the building. Rescue and recovery efforts are ongoing as authorities work to account for those unlocated.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Pause Linked to Washington Shooting</h2>
<p>The United States has suspended immigration requests for Afghan nationals after a shooting incident involving an individual who entered the country in September 2021. The alleged gunman in the Washington National Guard shooting is an Afghan national. The suspension reflects increased scrutiny on immigration policies amid security concerns following the event.</p>
<h2>France Reintroduces Military Service Program</h2>
<p>France is set to introduce a new form of military service 25 years after phasing out conscription. President Emmanuel Macron stated, "The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it," emphasizing the importance of readiness. The program aims to strengthen national security and prepare citizens for future challenges.</p>
<h2>Guinea-Bissau Leadership Change After Coup</h2>
<p>A day after a military coup, General Horta N’Tam was sworn in as the new leader of Guinea-Bissau during a ceremony at the army headquarters. This follows a period of political instability and marks a significant change in the country’s leadership. The situation remains fluid as the new government establishes its authority.</p>
<h2>Geopolitical Tensions and Movements</h2>
<p>Venezuela has banned six major airlines after escalating tensions with the United States. The airlines stopped flying to Venezuela following US warnings about increased military activity in the region. Meanwhile, a year after the ceasefire in southern Lebanon, Israeli strikes continue targeting Hezbollah, aiming to counter its recovery efforts from their previous conflict.</p>
<p>In related developments, Pope Leo visited Turkey on his first foreign trip, warning that the future of humanity is at stake due to ongoing conflicts. He described the situation as a third world war being "fought piecemeal," urging for peaceful solutions.</p>
<h2>Argentina’s Energy Boom Hopes</h2>
<p>Argentina is experiencing a transformation in a local town due to fracking, which has boosted oil and gas production. The country hopes this energy boom will bring broader economic benefits nationwide. This marks an important development in Argentina’s energy sector and economic planning.</p>
<h2>South Africa’s G20 Dispute with US</h2>
<p>Tensions remain between South Africa and the United States after the US boycotted the G20 summit in Johannesburg. The US decision was based on claims of persecution of the white minority in South Africa, which are widely discredited. South Africa has responded strongly to this move, highlighting ongoing diplomatic strains.</p>
