    <h2>Devastating Fire in Hong Kong Tower Blocks</h2>
<p>Firefighters are continuing to search for hundreds of people still missing after a large fire broke out earlier this week in several tower blocks in Hong Kong. Dozens have been confirmed dead so far. Video footage verified by the BBC shows how rapidly the fire spread through Wang Cheong House, a residential building, underscoring the suddenness and scale of the blaze. Rescue efforts remain ongoing as authorities work to account for those who have yet to be found.</p>
<h2>Tensions and Conflict in Ukraine and Lebanon</h2>
<p>In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated demands for Ukrainian territory ahead of upcoming talks with the US. He accused Kyiv of wanting to fight "to the last Ukrainian," and stated that Russia is "in principle" prepared for a prolonged conflict. Meanwhile, in southern Lebanon, a year after a ceasefire was declared, peace has remained elusive as Israeli strikes continue. Israel says these attacks target Hezbollah’s attempts to recover from the prior conflict, highlighting ongoing instability in the region.</p>
<h2>Changes in Military Service in France</h2>
<p>France announced plans to reintroduce a form of military service 25 years after conscription was phased out. President Emmanuel Macron emphasized that preparation is essential to avoid future dangers, signaling a shift in national defense policy. Details about how this new service will be structured and implemented are expected to follow as the government moves forward with the plan.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Afghan Immigration Requests after Shooting Incident</h2>
<p>The United States has temporarily suspended immigration requests for Afghans following a shooting involving an Afghan national in Washington. The alleged gunman entered the US in September 2021. This pause comes amid heightened security concerns and may affect immigration processing for Afghan nationals in the near term.</p>
<h2>Developments in Venezuela and Argentina</h2>
<p>Venezuela has banned six major airlines that stopped flights to the country after the US warned of increased military activity, escalating tensions between the two nations. Meanwhile, Argentina’s oil and gas industry has been transformed by fracking in one town, raising hopes that the resulting boom can benefit the wider nation. The government is watching these developments closely as it seeks to boost energy production and economic growth.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Diplomatic Updates</h2>
<p>Mohammed Ibrahim, a Palestinian-US teenager, was released after spending nine months in an Israeli jail. He was arrested while on holiday from Florida, accused of throwing rocks at Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. His release comes amid ongoing tensions in the region. Additionally, Pope Leo, on his first foreign trip to Turkey, warned that the future of humanity is at stake due to current global conflicts. He described the situation as a "piecemeal" third world war, highlighting concerns about escalating violence worldwide.</p>
