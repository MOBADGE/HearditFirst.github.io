    <h2>Major Fire in Hong Kong Tower Blocks</h2>
<p>Firefighters are continuing to search for hundreds of people still missing after a devastating fire engulfed the Wang Cheong House tower blocks in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Dozens have been confirmed dead, but the full toll remains unclear as hundreds remain unaccounted for. Video footage has shown how quickly the fire spread through the building, highlighting the rapid and destructive nature of the blaze. Rescue efforts are ongoing, with authorities working to locate survivors and determine the cause of the fire.</p>
<h2>Tensions and Talks on Ukraine-Russia Conflict</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated his demands for Ukrainian territory ahead of upcoming talks with US officials in Moscow. He accused Kyiv of being willing to fight "to the last Ukrainian" and said Russia is also prepared to continue fighting "in principle." These comments come at a critical moment as diplomatic efforts continue to address the ongoing conflict in the region. The negotiations with the United States may have significant implications for future peace efforts or further escalation.</p>
<h2>Shifts in Military and Security Policies</h2>
<p>France announced it will introduce a form of military service 25 years after phasing out conscription. President Emmanuel Macron stated, "The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it," signaling a renewed focus on national defense and readiness. Meanwhile, in Guinea-Bissau, General Horta N’Tam was officially sworn in as the new leader just one day after a military coup, marking a significant political change in the country. On another front, the US has suspended immigration requests for Afghans following a shooting incident in Washington involving an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021.</p>
<h2>Growing Regional Conflicts and International Responses</h2>
<p>A year after a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, violence has continued as Israeli strikes target what it says are Hezbollah's efforts to recover from previous conflicts. This ongoing tension underscores the fragile nature of peace in the region. Separately, Venezuela has banned six major airlines after escalating tensions with the United States. The affected airlines stopped flying to Venezuela after the US issued warnings about increased military activity nearby, indicating heightened geopolitical strain in Latin America.</p>
<h2>Economic Developments in Energy Sector</h2>
<p>Argentina is experiencing a transformation in parts of the country due to fracking, which is driving an oil and gas boom. National hopes are high that this growth in energy production will support wider economic benefits across the country. This development could have lasting effects on Argentina’s economy and energy independence, though the broader national impact remains to be seen.</p>
