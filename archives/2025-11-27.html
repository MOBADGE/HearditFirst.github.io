    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>Firefighters in Hong Kong are continuing their search for hundreds of people still missing after a major fire engulfed the Wang Cheong House tower blocks on Wednesday. Dozens of deaths have been confirmed so far, though the full toll remains unclear as many individuals have not been accounted for. Video footage verified by the BBC shows how quickly the fire spread through the building, highlighting the intensity of the blaze. Rescue efforts are ongoing, with authorities focused on locating survivors and managing the aftermath of this devastating incident.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Tensions</h2>
<p>In Moscow, Vladimir Putin has reiterated Russia’s firm demands regarding Ukrainian territory ahead of scheduled talks with US officials. He accused the Ukrainian government of seeking to fight "to the last Ukrainian," a stance Russia says it is ready to confront "in principle." This hardline rhetoric signals a continued escalation in the conflict, with potential implications for diplomatic negotiations planned between Russia and the United States. The situation remains tense as both sides prepare for important discussions.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Afghan Immigration Requests</h2>
<p>Following a shooting in Washington involving an Afghan national, the United States government has suspended immigration requests for Afghans. The alleged shooter entered the US in September 2021 and is currently under investigation. This development reflects heightened security concerns and may affect ongoing immigration procedures involving Afghan nationals. Officials have not yet announced when or if the suspension will be lifted.</p>
<h2>Changes in France’s Military Service</h2>
<p>France is set to reintroduce a form of military service 25 years after phasing out conscription. President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the need to "prepare for danger," underpinning the government’s decision to bring back this measure. While details are still emerging, the move marks a significant shift in France’s approach to national defense and could impact young people across the country. The new service aims to strengthen national readiness in an increasingly uncertain security environment.</p>
<h2>Political Shift in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>A day after a military coup, General Horta N’Tam has been named the new leader of Guinea-Bissau. He took an oath during a ceremony held at the army headquarters. The situation in Guinea-Bissau remains fluid as the new leadership settles in, and observers are watching closely to see how this change will affect the country’s stability and governance moving forward.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Bans Six Major Airlines</h2>
<p>Venezuela has banned six major international airlines that ceased flying to the country amid escalating tensions with the United States. The affected carriers stopped operations after the US government issued warnings about increased military activity in the region. This ban further complicates travel and diplomatic relations between Venezuela and other countries and may have a broader impact on regional connectivity and economic ties.</p>
