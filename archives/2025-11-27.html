    <h2>Hong Kong Tower Block Fire</h2>
<p>Rescue teams are searching for hundreds of people still missing after a devastating fire swept through the Wang Cheong House tower blocks in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Dozens of people have died in the blaze, which spread rapidly as shown in video footage verified through geolocation. The search continues amid concerns about the large number of unaccounted residents. This tragic event highlights urgent needs for fire safety measures in densely populated urban housing.</p>
<h2>Tensions in Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Ahead of planned talks with US officials in Moscow, Vladimir Putin intensified his stance on the conflict with Ukraine. He accused Kyiv of seeking to continue fighting "to the last Ukrainian" and said Russia is willing to fight under the same premise. These statements underscore the ongoing high tensions and unresolved issues in the conflict, making diplomatic progress uncertain in the near term.</p>
<h2>US-Afghan Immigration Suspension After Shooting</h2>
<p>The United States has suspended immigration requests for Afghan nationals following a shooting incident in Washington. The alleged shooter is an Afghan national who entered the US in September 2021. This move reflects increased security concerns linked to immigration policies and may affect future processes for Afghan asylum seekers or immigrants.</p>
<h2>Changes in French Military Service</h2>
<p>France plans to reintroduce a form of military service 25 years after ending conscription. President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the need to prepare for future dangers as the motivation behind the policy change. This initiative marks a shift in France's approach to national defense and youth engagement in military-related activities.</p>
<h2>Regional Conflicts and International Responses</h2>
<p>A year after a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, Israeli strikes continue against targets described as efforts by Hezbollah to rebuild. This ongoing violence shows that peace remains fragile in the region. In addition, Venezuela has banned six major airlines amid escalating tensions with the US, including warnings about increased military activity. These developments highlight persistent instability and geopolitics shaping regional security.</p>
<h2>Global Reflections on Conflict</h2>
<p>Pope Leo’s first foreign trip took him to Turkey, where he called attention to the broader stakes of current global conflicts. He described a third world war as being "fought piecemeal," pointing to ongoing violence and its impact on humanity’s future. His message brings focus to the humanitarian and diplomatic challenges faced worldwide today.</p>
