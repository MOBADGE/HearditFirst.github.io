    <h2>Fire in Hong Kong Tower Blocks</h2>
<p>A major fire broke out on Wednesday in the Wang Cheong House tower blocks in Hong Kong, resulting in dozens of deaths. Firefighters are still searching for hundreds of people who remain missing following the blaze. Video footage verified by BBC shows how quickly the fire spread through the building, highlighting the severity and rapid development of the incident. Authorities continue rescue efforts, but the toll and extent of damage remain significant.</p>
<h2>Developments in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated his demands for Ukrainian territory ahead of upcoming talks with the United States in Moscow. He criticized Kyiv for wanting to continue fighting "to the last Ukrainian" and stated that Russia is also prepared to fight thoroughly. This stance underscores ongoing tensions and challenges in reaching a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Prisoner Release</h2>
<p>Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American teenager, was released after spending nine months in an Israeli jail. He was arrested last year while on holiday from Florida for allegedly throwing rocks at Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Meanwhile, in Lebanon, a year after a ceasefire, Israeli military strikes continue targeting what Israel describes as Hezbollah's efforts to rebuild. These events reflect continued instability and conflict challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy Changes After Shooting</h2>
<p>The United States has paused immigration requests from Afghan nationals in the wake of a shooting incident involving an Afghan man who entered the country in 2021. Authorities are reviewing security measures following the shooting by a person with Afghan nationality, indicating heightened scrutiny of immigration processes amid concerns over safety.</p>
<h2>France Reintroduces Military Service</h2>
<p>France plans to reintroduce a form of military service, 25 years after ending conscription. President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the importance of preparation to avoid danger, signaling a shift in national defense strategy. This move aims to engage more young people in defense readiness amid changing global security conditions.</p>
<h2>Venezuela Bans Major Airlines Amid US Tensions</h2>
<p>Venezuela has banned six major airlines from its airspace after these carriers stopped flying to the country following warnings from the US about increased military activity. The ban marks an escalation in tensions between Venezuela and the US, affecting international travel and diplomacy in the region.</p>
<h2>Oil Boom in Argentina</h2>
<p>Argentina is experiencing an oil and gas boom due to fracking, which has significantly transformed one local town. The country hopes this energy development will bring broader economic benefits nationwide as it seeks to leverage natural resource opportunities amid global energy dynamics.</p>
<h2>Pope Leo Warns of Global Conflict Risks</h2>
<p>During his first foreign trip to Turkey, Pope Leo spoke about the serious risks facing humanity due to ongoing conflicts. He cautioned that a third world war is being "fought piecemeal," emphasizing the urgent need for peace and diplomatic solutions to avoid larger global confrontations.</p>
