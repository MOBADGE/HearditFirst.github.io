    <h2>Major Fire in Hong Kong Apartment Block</h2>
<p>A devastating fire has claimed at least 44 lives in a residential building in Hong Kong. The blaze, which took firefighters 18 hours to contain, has left hundreds missing as emergency teams continue searching through the rubble. This incident highlights safety concerns in densely populated urban areas, and the community remains on alert as authorities investigate the cause and respond to the disaster.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest and Military Coup in Guinea-Bissau</h2>
<p>Guinea-Bissau is facing a serious political crisis after soldiers seized power and detained the president. This military takeover occurred just as the country was awaiting election results from the recent vote held on Sunday. The situation raises questions about the future of governance and stability in the West African nation, with regional and international observers likely to monitor developments closely.</p>
<h2>Continued Conflict in South Lebanon</h2>
<p>Despite a ceasefire agreement a year ago, violence persists in southern Lebanon. Israel has launched strikes targeting Hezbollah positions, citing concerns over the group’s attempts to regroup and rebuild after the recent war. The ongoing clashes suggest that a lasting peace remains elusive in the region, increasing tensions that could affect broader Middle Eastern stability.</p>
<h2>Pope Leo’s First Foreign Visit to Turkey and Beirut</h2>
<p>Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo is making his first international trip to Turkey. During his visit, he will meet with leaders from various Christian traditions in the historic city of Nicaea and celebrate Mass in Beirut. This trip is significant for fostering interfaith dialogue and may help strengthen relationships among Christian communities in the region.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Health Concerns in India and Argentina</h2>
<p>In India’s capital, Delhi, toxic air pollution poses serious health risks, especially for children. Hospitals report a surge in young patients experiencing respiratory problems such as coughing and difficulty breathing, emphasizing the urgent need for environmental and public health measures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Argentina is experiencing an oil and gas boom driven by fracking technology, which has transformed one town’s economy. The government hopes this energy development will bring wider benefits to the nation, though the long-term impacts—both positive and negative—remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Protests in Georgia</h2>
<p>Protests in Georgia have entered a second year following the prime minister’s announcement of a four-year pause in efforts to join the European Union. Demonstrators remain steadfast in their resistance, signaling strong public demand for continued EU integration and democratic reforms despite political setbacks. This sustained activism reflects underlying societal tensions about the country’s future direction.</p>
