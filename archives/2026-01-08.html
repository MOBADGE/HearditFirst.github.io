    <h2>Middle East and North Africa</h2>
<p>Iran is seeing violent protests spread to more regions, with videos showing security forces using guns and tear gas against demonstrators. Semi-official Iranian media report that two police officers have been killed in a town in the west of the country. Meanwhile, in Lebanon, the army has taken over security responsibilities in the predominantly Hezbollah-controlled south, claiming it has removed non-state weapons from the area. However, Israel has called Lebanon’s efforts insufficient.</p>
<p>In Yemen, the Saudi-led coalition has accused the United Arab Emirates of helping the separatist leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi escape the country. According to the coalition, al-Zubaidi fled by boat to Somaliland before flying to Abu Dhabi. This highlights ongoing tensions within the Saudi-led coalition and Yemeni factions.</p>
<h2>United States and International Affairs</h2>
<p>The US government has announced its withdrawal from a major international climate treaty along with dozens of associated organizations. The White House said the decision was made because these groups "no longer serve American interests." This move represents a significant shift in US climate policy with potential global impacts.</p>
<p>Regarding Venezuela, the US president stated that American involvement in the country’s affairs may continue for years, though the ultimate duration remains uncertain. This signals a long-term commitment to the situation in Venezuela, though specifics were not provided.</p>
<p>In Somalia, the US has halted its aid assistance after claims that food intended for vulnerable populations was illegally seized. Somali officials deny these allegations and maintain that the World Food Programme still holds the 76 tonnes of disputed aid.</p>
<h2>Religious Institutions</h2>
<p>China is intensifying its crackdown on Christian groups, with reports that leaders from the Early Rain Covenant Church have been arrested and that the Yayang Church is being dismantled. This escalation reflects ongoing government restrictions on religious organizations.</p>
<p>In Spain, the Catholic Church has signed an agreement to compensate victims of sexual abuse following widespread criticism that church authorities failed to adequately address these cases. The deal aims to provide reparations and potentially improve accountability on this issue.</p>
<h2>Europe and Greenland</h2>
<p>Criticism has been directed at Denmark and its European allies regarding their approach to Greenland. One commentator highlighted that Denmark and Europe have not sufficiently handled what he called the 'critical' importance of the semi-autonomous territory. Meanwhile, European partners have rejected proposals by Donald Trump to annex Greenland, underscoring limited international support for such plans.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>A professional women’s tennis tournament in Kenya has attracted attention after a wildcard amateur player’s poor performance went viral. In response, event organisers admitted that allowing the amateur to compete was a mistake, acknowledging they should have better ensured player suitability for the professional level.</p>
