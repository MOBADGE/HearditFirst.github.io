    <h2>Iran Protests Spread Amid Rising Violence</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have expanded to new areas, with violent clashes reported. Semi-official Iranian media say two police officers were killed in a town in the west. Videos circulating online show security forces using guns and tear gas against demonstrators in other locations. The unrest highlights growing tensions in the country and suggests the protests may continue, raising concerns about stability and government response in the coming days.</p>
<h2>US Withdraws from Climate Treaty and Other Groups</h2>
<p>The White House announced that the United States is withdrawing from a key international climate treaty as well as dozens of other multilateral organizations. Officials stated the move was due to these entities “no longer serving American interests.” This decision marks a shift in US engagement on global climate efforts, potentially affecting international cooperation on environmental issues and the country's role in addressing climate change.</p>
<h2>China Intensifies Crackdown on Christian Churches</h2>
<p>In China, authorities have arrested leaders of the Early Rain Covenant Church, a prominent Christian congregation. Additionally, the Yayang Church is being demolished. These actions are part of a broader crackdown on Christian groups, underscoring ongoing restrictions on religious freedom in the country. The situation raises concerns about the treatment of religious minorities and the government's approach to faith-based communities.</p>
<h2>Lebanon Army Takes Control in Hezbollah-Dominated South</h2>
<p>The Lebanese army announced it has taken over security responsibilities in southern Lebanon, an area previously dominated by Hezbollah. The army stated it has achieved its objective of clearing the region of non-state weapons. However, Israel criticized the move as “insufficient,” indicating ongoing regional tensions. This development may influence future stability and security dynamics along the Lebanon-Israel border.</p>
<h2>US Halts Food Aid to Somalia Over Seizure Claims</h2>
<p>The United States has stopped assistance to Somalia following allegations that 76 tonnes of food aid were illegally seized. Somali officials deny these claims, insisting the aid remains under the control of the World Food Programme. The suspension of aid could have serious humanitarian implications amid ongoing challenges in Somalia and may affect the relationship between the US and Somali authorities pending further investigation.</p>
<h2>Saudi-Led Coalition Accuses UAE of Smuggling Yemeni Separatist Leader</h2>
<p>The Saudi-led coalition accused the United Arab Emirates of assisting in the secret transfer of Aidarous al-Zubaidi, leader of the Southern Transitional Council in Yemen, out of the country. According to the coalition, al-Zubaidi fled by boat to Somaliland before flying to Abu Dhabi. This allegation adds complexity to the ongoing conflict in Yemen and reflects tensions within the coalition supporting the Yemeni government.</p>
