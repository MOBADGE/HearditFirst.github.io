    <h2>US Immigration Incident in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>A US immigration agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis. The woman was reportedly trying to run over ICE agents, according to Donald Trump. However, local leaders in Minneapolis have disputed this account. The incident has raised concerns about the use of force by immigration enforcement in the city, highlighting ongoing tensions between federal agents and local communities.</p>
<h2>Protests and Clashes in Iran</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have expanded to more regions, with violent clashes reported. Semi-official Iranian media stated that two police officers were killed in a western town amid the unrest. Videos circulating online show security forces using guns and tear gas against crowds in several areas. This escalation continues as public dissent grows, indicating a fragile security situation in parts of the country.</p>
<h2>US Withdraws from Climate and Other International Groups</h2>
<p>The US government announced it is withdrawing from a key climate treaty and dozens of other international organizations. The White House explained the decision by saying these entities "no longer serve American interests." This move signals a shift in US international engagement on climate change and global cooperation, and it could affect the country's relationships with other nations working on environmental issues.</p>
<h2>China Intensifies Crackdown on Christian Churches</h2>
<p>Authorities in China have reportedly arrested leaders of the Early Rain Covenant Church, an influential Christian group. Additionally, the Yayang Church is being demolished. These actions are part of a wider crackdown on Christian communities in the country. The arrests and destruction of churches underline increasing restrictions on religious groups and raise concerns about religious freedom in China.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Security Updates</h2>
<p>In Somalia, the US has stopped providing aid after allegations that food aid was seized illegally. The Trump administration emphasized a zero-tolerance policy for waste and misuse in its assistance programs. Meanwhile, in Gaza, children are returning to school after years without formal education due to ongoing conflicts. Most schools in the territory have suffered damage or destruction, according to Unicef.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Security Challenges in Australia and Ukraine</h2>
<p>Australia is experiencing a severe heatwave, with officials warning of a "catastrophic" fire risk. Northern Victoria's fire danger level is being set at the highest possible rating, raising concerns about wildfires. In Ukraine, Russian strikes have left about one million people without heat and water in Dnipropetrovsk and surrounding areas. Efforts are ongoing to restore these essential services amid the conflict.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Developments</h2>
<p>Cambodia extradited Chen Zhi to China, who is accused of masterminding a global scam using his business as a front for fraud activities. Additionally, Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a royal commission into the Bondi shooting, responding to community pressure after initially resisting such an inquiry.</p>
