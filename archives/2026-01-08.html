    <h2>US Immigration Agent Fatally Shoots Woman in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>A woman was shot and killed by a US immigration enforcement agent in Minneapolis. The incident has sparked disagreement about what happened. The US president claimed the woman attempted to run over ICE agents, but local leaders have questioned this account. The event has raised tensions around immigration enforcement and the use of force.</p>
<h2>Iran Protests Intensify Amid Deadly Clashes</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have spread to more areas, with reports of violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Semi-official media reported that two police officers were killed in a western town. Videos show security personnel firing guns and tear gas at crowds. The situation reflects ongoing unrest and growing resistance to authorities, posing challenges for the government's control.</p>
<h2>US Withdraws from Key Climate Treaty and Other Groups</h2>
<p>The White House announced the United States will withdraw from a major climate treaty along with dozens of other international entities. The administration stated these bodies "no longer serve American interests." This move signals a shift in US climate policy and may affect global efforts to address environmental issues, as well as the country's relationships with other nations on climate cooperation.</p>
<h2>Religious Crackdowns and Responses</h2>
<p>In China, there has been an intensification of government actions against Christian groups. Leaders of the Early Rain Covenant Church have been arrested, and the Yayang Church is reportedly being demolished. Meanwhile, in Spain, the Catholic Church has signed a deal to compensate victims of sexual abuse following criticism over inadequate handling of such cases. These developments highlight ongoing struggles within religious communities, both in terms of government suppression and accountability.</p>
<h2>Security and Foreign Policy Developments</h2>
<p>In Lebanon, the army announced it has taken control of security in the south, an area long influenced by Hezbollah. The military claims to have cleared non-state weapons, though Israel has deemed the measures "insufficient." In Venezuela, the US president has indicated that American involvement in the country might continue for an extended period, emphasizing uncertainty about the future duration of engagement.</p>
<h2>Aid Controversy in Somalia</h2>
<p>The US has paused assistance to Somalia amid allegations that food aid was illegally seized. Somalia denies these accusations, assuring that 76 tonnes of aid remain with the World Food Programme. The suspension of aid raises concerns about humanitarian efforts in the region and the relationship between Somalia and international partners.</p>
