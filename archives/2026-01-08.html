    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The Lebanese army announced it has taken full control of security in the southern region dominated by Hezbollah. Officials state they have cleared the area of unauthorized weapons, but Israel considers this effort insufficient. Meanwhile, the Saudi-led coalition accused the United Arab Emirates of helping smuggle Aidarous al-Zubaidi, leader of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, out of Yemen. Al-Zubaidi reportedly fled by boat to Somaliland and then flew to Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, the US president said the country could remain a focus of American involvement for years to come, emphasizing uncertainty over how long the administration will stay engaged in the country's affairs.</p>
<h2>US Policy Changes</h2>
<p>The US announced it is withdrawing from a key international climate treaty along with dozens of other groups, stating these entities "no longer serve American interests." In addition, the US has halted aid to Somalia amid accusations that 76 tonnes of food aid were illegally seized; Somalia denies this and says the food remains with the World Food Programme.</p>
<h2>Europe and Greenland</h2>
<p>European allies have rejected suggestions by Donald Trump to annex Greenland, the semi-autonomous Danish territory regarded as strategically important. Criticism has been directed at Denmark and Europe's handling of Greenland's role amid growing geopolitical interest in the Arctic.</p>
<h2>Religious Issues</h2>
<p>China is intensifying its crackdown on Christian groups, with reports of arrests of leaders from the influential Early Rain Covenant Church and demolition of Yayang Church buildings. In Spain, the Catholic Church signed a new deal to compensate victims of sexual abuse, responding to public complaints that religious leaders have not adequately addressed these issues.</p>
<h2>Sports and Culture</h2>
<p>Tennis Kenya admitted it was a mistake to allow an amateur player to compete in a professional women's tournament after the player's poor performance went viral online. In another cultural moment, Algeria apologized after a player mocked a Congolese superfan who attended the Africa Cup of Nations matches dressed as Patrice Lumumba, a pan-African hero. The superfan had stood motionless as a tribute throughout the games.</p>
