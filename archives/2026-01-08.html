    <h2>US Immigration Incident in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>An immigration enforcement agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis, sparking controversy over the circumstances. The former US president stated the woman tried to run over ICE agents, but local officials dispute this account. The incident raises questions about the use of force by immigration authorities and is likely to prompt further investigations.</p>
<h2>Protests and Violence in Iran</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have escalated and spread to new regions. Semi-official media reported the deaths of two police officers in a western town amid the unrest. Videos from the scene show security forces using guns and tear gas against demonstrators. The situation remains tense and could lead to broader instability depending on how authorities and protesters respond.</p>
<h2>US Withdraws from Climate Treaty Groups</h2>
<p>The White House announced that the US is pulling out of a major climate treaty along with dozens of related organizations. Officials said these agreements "no longer serve American interests," marking a significant shift in the country's approach to international climate cooperation. This move may affect global climate efforts and international relations going forward.</p>
<h2>Struggles in Ukraine Following Russian Attacks</h2>
<p>A Russian strike on Ukraine’s southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region left about one million people without heat and water. Ukrainian officials report ongoing efforts to restore these essential services. The attack highlights the continuing infrastructure damage and civilian hardships stemming from the conflict, with broad humanitarian and security implications.</p>
<h2>Australia's Heatwave and Fire Risks</h2>
<p>Northern Victoria in Australia is facing a severe heatwave, with fire danger levels raised to the highest possible category. Officials have described the fire risks as "catastrophic," underscoring the threat of wildfires in the area. This situation calls for heightened preparedness and could impact local communities and emergency services.</p>
<h2>Developments in Australian Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Australia’s prime minister announced a royal commission to investigate the Bondi shooting, reversing earlier reluctance amidst community pressure. Additionally, a British man linked to the National Socialist Network is set to be deported after his visa was cancelled. These actions reflect ongoing attention to public safety and social issues within the country.</p>
