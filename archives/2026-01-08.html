    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 08, 2026</div>
    <h2>Security and Violence in Iran and the US</h2>
<p>Protests across Iran have intensified, with semi-official media reporting that two police officers were killed in a western town. Videos circulating online show security forces using gunfire and tear gas against crowds in multiple areas. This escalation highlights continuing unrest and the government's efforts to control it.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, a US immigration enforcement agent fatally shot a woman. Former US president Trump stated that she was attempting to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. However, local officials have disputed this account, signaling a disagreement over the circumstances of the shooting.</p>
<h2>US Policy Shifts and International Relations</h2>
<p>The United States has announced withdrawals from a key climate treaty along with dozens of other international organizations. The White House explained the decision by saying these entities "no longer serve American interests," marking a significant shift away from past commitments on global cooperation around climate issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, the US president indicated that American involvement in Venezuela may continue for years. No specific end date was given, with the administration suggesting the situation's complexity requires a long-term engagement.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>The Lebanese army stated it has taken control over security in the south of the country, an area previously dominated by Hezbollah. The military claims to have cleared the region of non-state weapons. Nevertheless, Israel has deemed the Lebanese army’s efforts "insufficient," reflecting ongoing regional concerns.</p>
<p>In Yemen, the Saudi-led coalition accused the United Arab Emirates of assisting the escape of Aidarous al-Zubaidi, leader of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council. According to the coalition, al-Zubaidi fled to Somaliland by boat before flying to Abu Dhabi, indicating tensions within the coalition.</p>
<h2>Religious and Human Rights Issues</h2>
<p>In Spain, the Catholic Church has signed a new agreement to compensate victims of sexual abuse. This move comes after criticism that church authorities had inadequately addressed the abuse issue in the past.</p>
<p>In China, reports have emerged of a crackdown on Christian groups. Leaders of the Early Rain Covenant Church have been arrested, and the Yayang Church is reportedly being demolished. These actions point to increasing pressure on religious communities within the country.</p>
<h2>US-Africa Relations and Aid Concerns</h2>
<p>The US has stopped sending aid to Somalia over allegations that food supplies were illegally confiscated. Somalia has denied these claims, stating that 76 tonnes of aid remain under the control of the World Food Programme. This development could affect humanitarian assistance efforts amid ongoing challenges in Somalia.</p>
