    <h2>US Immigration Incident in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>A US immigration agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis, leading to differing accounts of the event. Former President Trump claimed the woman was trying to run over ICE agents, but local leaders have disputed this version of events. The incident has raised questions about law enforcement tactics and accountability in immigration enforcement. Further investigation will likely explore the circumstances surrounding the shooting and its impact on the community.</p>
<h2>Protests and Violence in Iran</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have expanded to new areas, amid growing unrest. Semi-official media report that two police officers were killed in a western town. Videos circulating online show security forces using gunfire and tear gas against demonstrators in other locations. The escalating violence highlights tensions between the public and authorities, and the situation remains volatile with uncertain prospects for resolution.</p>
<h2>US Withdraws from Climate Groups</h2>
<p>The White House announced that the United States is withdrawing from a key international climate treaty along with several other groups. The decision was justified by officials as a move to protect American interests, stating these entities no longer serve the country’s goals. This shift may affect global cooperation on climate change, as the US plays a significant role in international environmental efforts.</p>
<h2>Developments in Yemen and Venezuela</h2>
<p>In Yemen, the Saudi-led coalition accused the United Arab Emirates of assisting the Southern Transitional Council leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi to flee the country. Al-Zubaidi reportedly escaped by boat to Somaliland before flying to Abu Dhabi. The event adds complexity to the already fragmented conflict in Yemen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former President Trump indicated that US involvement in Venezuela could continue for years. He suggested that the duration of the US role in Venezuelan affairs will depend on unfolding circumstances, signaling a long-term engagement in the country’s political situation.</p>
<h2>Changes in US Foreign Aid and Somalia</h2>
<p>The US government has halted assistance to Somalia after claims emerged that food aid was seized illegally. A US official emphasized the administration’s zero-tolerance policy for waste and misuse of aid resources. This action could affect humanitarian efforts in Somalia, where aid is critical for vulnerable populations.</p>
<h2>Education Resumes in Gaza</h2>
<p>After years without formal education due to conflict, children in Gaza have resumed attending school. Unicef reported that most of the territory’s schools were damaged or destroyed during the war, but efforts to reopen them are underway. This development is important for the future of children in Gaza, providing some stability and opportunities for learning despite ongoing challenges.</p>
<h2>Australia Orders Inquiry into Bondi Shooting</h2>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a royal commission into the Bondi shooting. This decision follows pressure from the Jewish community and marks a reversal from his previous reluctance. The inquiry aims to thoroughly examine the events surrounding the shooting, addressing concerns and seeking accountability.</p>
