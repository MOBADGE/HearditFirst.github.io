    <h2>US Immigration Incident in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>An immigration agent in Minneapolis fatally shot a woman during an enforcement action. Former US president Donald Trump said the woman was trying to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, but local leaders disputed this account. The incident has sparked debate over the use of force by immigration authorities and the circumstances that led to the fatal shooting. The differing views between national and local officials highlight ongoing tensions around immigration enforcement policies.</p>
<h2>Protests and Violence in Iran</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have spread to more areas amid reports of violent clashes. Semi-official Iranian media reported that two police officers were killed in a western town. Videos circulating online show security forces firing guns and using tear gas against crowds in various locations. These developments suggest the demonstrations are intensifying and that the government's response remains forceful. The situation may lead to further unrest depending on how authorities and protestors react in the coming days.</p>
<h2>US Foreign and Domestic Policy Updates</h2>
<p>The US administration announced it is withdrawing from a key international climate treaty along with several other groups, stating these entities "no longer serve American interests." This move signals a shift in US engagement with global climate efforts and could have implications for international cooperation on environmental issues.</p>
<p>Separately, President Donald Trump commented that US involvement in Venezuela could continue for years. The length and nature of this engagement remain uncertain, with time expected to reveal more.</p>
<p>In Somalia, the US halted its assistance following allegations that food aid was illegally seized. A US official emphasized a zero-tolerance stance on waste, indicating stricter oversight of aid programs in conflict-affected regions.</p>
<h2>Religious Crackdown in China</h2>
<p>Reports have emerged of a crackdown on Christian groups in China. Leaders of the Early Rain Covenant Church have been arrested, and the Yayang Church is reportedly being demolished. This information points to ongoing pressure on religious communities within the country and raises concerns about religious freedom and human rights.</p>
<h2>Ukraine’s Infrastructure Challenges</h2>
<p>After widespread attacks in southeastern Ukraine, over one million people have been left without heat and water, particularly in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Efforts to restore essential services are underway. The damage to infrastructure underscores the ongoing difficulties faced by civilians amid the conflict and highlights the urgent need for repairs to support affected communities.</p>
<h2>Education Resumes in Gaza</h2>
<p>Children in Gaza are returning to school for the first time in years without formal education. Many schools in the territory have suffered damage or destruction during ongoing conflicts, according to Unicef. Restarting education marks an important step for children’s development and community recovery, though rebuilding the education system will likely be a long-term challenge.</p>
