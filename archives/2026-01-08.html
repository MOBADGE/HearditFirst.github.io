    <h2>United States: Controversy Over Immigration Agent Shooting</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, a U.S. immigration agent fatally shot a woman, sparking disagreement over the circumstances. Donald Trump stated the woman was attempting to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. However, local leaders have disputed this account. The incident has raised questions about law enforcement tactics and accountability in immigration enforcement.</p>
<h2>Iran: Protests Escalate with Violence and Casualties</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have spread to more areas, leading to violent clashes. Semi-official media reported the deaths of two police officers in a western town. Videos circulating show security forces using firearms and tear gas against demonstrators. The growing unrest reflects ongoing tensions in the country and challenges for Iranian authorities in managing public dissent.</p>
<h2>U.S. Withdraws From Climate Treaty and Other Groups</h2>
<p>The White House announced that the United States is withdrawing from a major climate treaty along with dozens of associated groups. Officials said the decision was made because these entities "no longer serve American interests." This move marks a shift in U.S. participation in international climate efforts and could affect global environmental cooperation going forward.</p>
<h2>Australia Faces Heatwave and Fire Risks; Royal Commission Announced</h2>
<p>Australia is experiencing a heatwave that has prompted officials to warn of "catastrophic" fire risk, especially in northern Victoria, where the fire danger level is at its highest. In addition, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission into a shooting incident in Bondi. This inquiry follows pressure from the Jewish community and indicates increased governmental scrutiny related to public safety.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Developments</h2>
<p>Cambodia extradited Chen Zhi to China, where he faces charges related to using his business as a front for international fraud operations. In Ukraine, Russian attacks caused widespread blackouts in the southeastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia, severely affecting power supplies there.</p>
<p>In immigration-related news from Australia, British national Ryan Turner is set to be deported over alleged links to the National Socialist Network, a neo-Nazi group. Meanwhile, in the U.S., reality TV star Spencer Pratt announced a longshot bid for mayor of Los Angeles, coinciding with the anniversary of a wildfire that destroyed his home.</p>
<p>Finally, Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Colombian President Gustavo Petro at the White House in the near future. The U.S. president called a recent phone conversation with Petro a "Great Honor," coming shortly after expressing support for a military operation in Colombia.</p>
