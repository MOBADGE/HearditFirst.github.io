    <h2>US Incident Raises Questions</h2>
<p>An immigration agent from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis. The US president stated that the woman was trying to run over ICE agents, however, local leaders have disputed this account. The circumstances of the shooting have sparked disagreement between federal and local authorities.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The US president described a recent phone call with Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia, as a "Great Honor." They are planning to meet at the White House in the "near future." This comes shortly after the US president commented positively on a potential military operation in Colombia, indicating ongoing discussions about security and cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Power Outages in Ukraine</h2>
