    <h2>U.S. Immigration Agent Fatally Shoots Woman in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>A U.S. immigration agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis. Former U.S. President Donald Trump said the woman had tried to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. However, local officials disputed this account, providing differing perspectives on the incident. The event has raised questions about the use of force in immigration enforcement, with potential scrutiny of ICE practices expected to continue.</p>
<h2>Protests and Security Clashes in Iran</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have expanded into new regions amid rising tensions. Semi-official Iranian media reported that two police officers were killed in a western town. Video footage circulating online shows security forces deploying tear gas and firearms to confront protesters in several locations. The growing unrest signals deepening dissatisfaction and the likelihood of ongoing clashes between demonstrators and authorities.</p>
<h2>U.S. Withdraws from Key Climate and International Groups</h2>
<p>The White House announced that the United States will withdraw from a significant climate treaty along with dozens of other international organizations. The administration stated this decision was made because these organizations "no longer serve American interests." This move may affect U.S. participation in global climate efforts and international cooperation, potentially altering the country's environmental policies and its relationships with the global community.</p>
<h2>Crackdown on Christian Churches in China</h2>
<p>Reports have emerged of a continuing crackdown on Christian groups in China. Leaders of the Early Rain Covenant Church have been arrested, and the Yayang Church is reportedly being demolished. These developments highlight intensified government pressure on religious organizations, which could impact religious freedom and community dynamics within the country.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Aid to Somalia Halted by U.S.</h2>
<p>The U.S. government has paused its assistance to Somalia following reports that food aid was illegally seized. A U.S. official emphasized that the administration is maintaining a zero-tolerance stance on waste and misuse of aid resources. This suspension could affect efforts to address food insecurity and humanitarian needs in Somalia while raising concerns about aid management and accountability.</p>
<h2>Heatwave and Fire Risk in Australia</h2>
<p>Australia is experiencing a significant heatwave, with officials warning of a “catastrophic” fire risk. The fire danger level in northern Victoria has been set to the highest possible rating. This alert indicates a heightened threat of wildfires, leading to increased preparedness measures to protect communities and natural areas during the extreme weather conditions.</p>
