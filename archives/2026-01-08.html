    <h2>Protests and Security Clashes in Iran</h2>
<p>Unrest in Iran continues to spread as protests move into more areas across the country. Semi-official media reported that two police officers were killed in a western town amid the violence. Video footage circulating online shows security forces using guns and tear gas to control crowds in various locations. The clashes highlight ongoing tensions and raise concerns about the government’s response to public dissent.</p>
<h2>US Changes Climate Policy by Withdrawing from Treaty</h2>
<p>The US government announced it is withdrawing from a significant international climate treaty, as well as several other related groups. Officials stated the decision was made because these organizations "no longer serve American interests." This move signals a shift in US climate policy and could have implications for global cooperation on addressing climate change.</p>
<h2>Crackdown on Churches in China Intensifies</h2>
<p>Reports from religious groups indicate a harsher crackdown on Christian communities in China. Leaders of the Early Rain Covenant Church have been arrested, and the Yayang Church is undergoing forced demolition. These actions reflect increasing pressure on religious groups and ongoing concerns about religious freedom in the country.</p>
<h2>Lebanon's Army Assumes Security Role in Southern Region</h2>
<p>The Lebanese army declared that it has taken control of security in the south, an area largely influenced by Hezbollah. The military says it has achieved its goal of clearing the region of non-state weapons. However, Israel has criticized the effort as "insufficient," indicating regional tensions remain high despite the army’s presence.</p>
<h2>Developments in Yemen and Somalia</h2>
<p>The Saudi-led coalition accused the United Arab Emirates of helping a separatist leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, escape Yemen. According to the coalition, he fled by boat to Somaliland before heading to Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, the US has halted aid to Somalia following allegations that 76 tonnes of food aid were improperly seized. Somalia denies these claims and maintains that the aid remains with the World Food Programme.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Tennis Kenya admitted it was a mistake to allow an amateur player to compete in a professional women's tournament after her widely shared poor performance. In Spain, the Catholic Church signed a compensation deal in response to complaints about inadequate handling of sexual abuse cases. Additionally, the US president stated that American involvement in Venezuela could continue for an extended period, with the duration still uncertain.</p>
