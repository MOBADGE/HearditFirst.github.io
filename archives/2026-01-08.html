    <h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>In Lebanon, the army announced it has taken control of security in the south, an area known for Hezbollah's influence. The military said it met its goal of clearing the region of non-state weapons. However, Israel has responded by calling this measure "insufficient," suggesting concerns remain about the area's security situation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Yemen, the Saudi-led coalition accused the United Arab Emirates of helping the separatist leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi escape. Zubaidi, who leads the Southern Transitional Council supported by the UAE, reportedly fled to Somaliland by boat before flying to Abu Dhabi. This development adds complexity to the region's ongoing conflicts.</p>
<h2>Iran Protests</h2>
<p>Large anti-government protests took place in Tehran and other major cities across Iran. Videos showed peaceful rallies occurring on main roads without intervention from security forces. The scale of these protests highlights continuing public discontent but also a momentary restraint by authorities, which may influence future government and public interactions.</p>
<h2>US Political and Foreign Policy Moves</h2>
<p>The White House announced the United States' withdrawal from a key international climate treaty along with dozens of other allied groups. Officials said this decision was made because these entities "no longer serve American interests." This move represents a significant shift in US engagement on global climate initiatives and could impact international cooperation.</p>
<p>On Venezuela, President Trump indicated that US involvement in the country might continue for years to come. He stated that only time will determine how long his administration remains involved in Venezuela's political affairs, suggesting a prolonged presence in the region.</p>
<p>Additionally, the US has halted assistance to Somalia following claims that 76 tonnes of food aid were illegally seized. Somalia denies these allegations, stating the aid remains with the World Food Programme. This suspension could affect humanitarian efforts amid ongoing challenges in Somalia.</p>
<h2>Europe and Greenland</h2>
<p>In Europe, criticism arose over how Denmark and its allies are managing Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory. European countries rejected former US President Trump's proposal to annex Greenland, underscoring tensions about the island's strategic importance and political future. The debate reflects broader concerns about Arctic influence and security among Western nations.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Religion</h2>
<p>Reports of intensified crackdowns on Christians in China emerged, with arrests made of leaders from the Early Rain Covenant Church and demolition of the Yayang Church. These actions point to ongoing restrictions on religious groups within the country.</p>
<p>In Spain, the Catholic Church signed a new agreement to provide compensation for victims of sexual abuse. This deal comes after widespread criticism that church authorities had previously failed to effectively address abuse cases, marking a significant step in accountability and support for survivors.</p>
<h2>Sports Headlines</h2>
<p>Tennis Kenya publicly admitted it was a mistake to allow an amateur player to compete in a professional women's tournament. The player's significant defeat went viral, prompting organisers to acknowledge that she should not have been given a wildcard to participate. This incident has sparked discussions about tournament entry standards and athlete development.</p>
