    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 05, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Security and Conflicts</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reported that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died in the ongoing war with Russia. He also noted that many people are officially missing, suggesting the total death toll may be significantly higher. This highlights the severe human cost of the conflict, which continues to affect the region and the world.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, a governor reported that dozens of Muslims were massacred for refusing to join jihadists. At least 78 bodies have been buried, and fears are that around 170 people were killed in total. This violence underscores ongoing security challenges and religious tensions in parts of Nigeria.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke with Donald Trump about the United States’ arms supply to Taiwan. Xi urged the US to be prudent in its approach, amidst recent visits by Western leaders to China. This conversation takes place in a context of heightened geopolitical sensitivity involving China, Taiwan, and the US.</p>
<p>Separately, the US launched a new plan to address China’s dominance in critical minerals. The initiative gathered representatives from over 50 countries, aiming to diversify supplies and reduce reliance on China for these essential resources. This could have significant implications for global supply chains and international trade.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>In Gaza, a hospital caring for newborn babies is struggling despite a ceasefire that began three months ago. Although more aid has been allowed into the area, the United Nations warns it remains far from sufficient to meet urgent needs. This situation exemplifies ongoing humanitarian challenges in conflict zones even after hostilities pause.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Australia, authorities have identified a suspect connected to the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont, who was last seen playing outside his home on a remote sheep station in September. The case has drawn attention to safety concerns in isolated communities.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Health</h2>
<p>A coroner’s investigation into the Bondi Junction mass killing revealed that the perpetrator’s doctor failed to act on warnings about a relapse of schizophrenia. The doctor is now being referred to a health regulator. This finding raises questions about the management of mental health care and public safety.</p>
<h2>Personal Stories</h2>
<p>US news anchor Savannah Guthrie has made a public plea for the safe return of her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who is 84 and missing. Guthrie stressed the urgency, saying her mother is without medication and needs it to survive. This personal appeal highlights the emotional toll of disappearances and the importance of community support.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>British singer Robbie Williams has celebrated success with his new album, Britpop, which has broken a record previously held by the Beatles. Williams reflected on the British tendency to underappreciate themselves, marking the achievement as a moment of pride amid cultural self-reflection.</p>
