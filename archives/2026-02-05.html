    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 05, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping has urged the United States to exercise caution when supplying arms to Taiwan. This message came during a recent call with former US president Donald Trump. The conversation follows a series of visits by Western leaders to China over the past few months, reflecting ongoing diplomatic engagement amid regional security concerns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US has launched a new plan aimed at reducing reliance on China's dominance in critical minerals. The initiative, which included representatives from more than 50 countries, underscores growing efforts to diversify supply chains and strengthen resilience in key industries.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, a jihadist group reportedly massacred dozens of local Muslims who refused to join them. This wave of violence has prompted the Nigerian government to confirm the deployment of US military personnel to the country. The move reflects heightened security challenges in the region and ongoing international cooperation to address them.</p>
<p>Tensions are also rising globally as the US-Russia nuclear weapons treaty known as New Start has expired. This treaty had limited the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for both countries. Its expiration raises fears of a renewed nuclear arms race and increased uncertainty about future arms control efforts.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>In Australia, a man has been charged with terrorism following a homemade bomb attack targeting Aboriginal Australians during a protest on Australia Day. The accused allegedly threw the device at a crowd gathered for the demonstration, highlighting ongoing social tensions and the use of violence in protests.</p>
<p>Additionally, a doctor who treated a mass killer in Bondi Junction has been referred to the health regulator. A coroner found that the doctor failed to act on warning signs indicating the patient was experiencing a relapse of schizophrenia. This case has renewed discussions about mental health care and public safety.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Health</h2>
<p>NBC news anchor Savannah Guthrie has publicly appealed for the safe return of her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, who has been abducted. Savannah emphasized that her mother is without necessary medication, which is essential for her survival, calling attention to the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, hospitals in Gaza continue to struggle to provide care for newborn babies despite an increase in aid since a ceasefire began three months ago. The United Nations has stated that the current level of assistance is insufficient to meet critical healthcare needs in the region.</p>
<h2>Missing Persons</h2>
<p>In Australia’s remote outback, authorities have identified a suspect in the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont. Gus was last seen playing outside his home on a sheep station on September 27. The ongoing search and investigation reflect the community’s concern and the challenges of law enforcement in isolated areas.</p>
<h2>Privacy Concerns</h2>
<p>An investigation by BBC Verify has revealed that naked images of partially clothed women remained unredacted in files related to Jeffrey Epstein, despite public outcry. The images show faces and bodies clearly visible, raising questions about privacy and the handling of sensitive materials in high-profile cases.</p>
