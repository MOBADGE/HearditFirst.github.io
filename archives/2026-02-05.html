    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 05, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke with Donald Trump on Wednesday, urging the US to be cautious when supplying arms to Taiwan. This call comes as Western leaders have recently made several visits to China, reflecting ongoing diplomatic efforts in the region. The message highlights continuing tensions over Taiwan and the complex dynamics between China and the US.</p>
<h2>Global Security</h2>
<p>The US-Russia nuclear arms treaty known as New Start has officially expired. This treaty had limited the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for both countries. Its expiration raises concerns about a potential new arms race between the two nations, increasing global security risks amid uncertain future negotiations.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>A hospital in Gaza is struggling to provide care for newborn babies despite more aid entering the area since a ceasefire began three months ago. The United Nations reports that the assistance is still far from sufficient to meet the healthcare needs of the population affected by ongoing conflict and blockade conditions.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>Several serious criminal cases have developed in Australia and Nigeria. In Australia, a man has been charged with terrorism after allegedly throwing a homemade bomb at a crowd protesting Australia Day. Separately, a coroner referred the doctor of Joel Cauchi, the Bondi Junction mass killer, to a health regulator for not addressing Cauchi’s schizophrenia relapse warnings. In Nigeria, a jihadist group reportedly killed dozens of local Muslims who refused to join them, prompting the government to confirm US military assistance in the region.</p>
<h2>Domestic and Personal Stories</h2>
<p>US news anchor Savannah Guthrie has made a public plea for the safe return of her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, who was abducted and is currently without necessary medicine. Meanwhile, in Australia, authorities have identified a suspect in the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont, who went missing on a remote sheep station in the outback last September.</p>
