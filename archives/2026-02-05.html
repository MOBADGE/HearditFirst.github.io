    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 05, 2026</div>
    <h2>Art and Culture</h2>
<p>The Louvre Museum in Paris has released images showing a crown that was stolen and then found "badly deformed" but still "intact" following a recent raid. The museum has expressed concern over the damage but confirmed that the crown survived the incident physically. The crown is an important cultural artifact, and its preservation, despite the attack, is significant for heritage conservation.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Asia</h2>
<p>Thailand is preparing for another round of voting this weekend after enduring three years of political turmoil. Popular progressive groups in the country face significant challenges even after winning elections, indicating ongoing political complexities and hurdles in stabilizing the government.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, despite a student-led uprising that raised hopes for political change, old political parties are expected to win a forthcoming landmark election. This suggests that while younger generations have pushed for reform, established political forces continue to hold significant influence.</p>
<h2>International Security and Investigations</h2>
<p>Norway has launched an investigation into former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland concerning alleged links to Jeffrey Epstein. Authorities have asked for Jagland's immunity to be revoked as part of the probe, which revolves around accusations of "aggravated corruption."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Israeli intelligence chief's brother, Bezalel Zini, who is also an Israeli military reservist on active duty, has been charged with smuggling 14 cartons of cigarettes into Gaza. The case alleges a financial transaction amounting to $117,000 for the smuggling operation.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange, marking the first such swap since October. A total of 157 Ukrainians and 160 Russians were returned to their home countries. Despite this exchange, ongoing peace talks between the two nations have ended without any breakthrough, signaling continued tension.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, authorities have accused Israel of spraying concentrated herbicide, specifically glyphosate, over southern villages that contain extensive farmland. Israel has not commented on the allegations, raising concerns about potential environmental and agricultural impacts.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, violence has escalated with reports from a governor stating that dozens of Muslims have been massacred for refusing to join jihadist groups. At least 78 bodies have been buried, and there are fears that the total death toll could be around 170, highlighting a severe security and humanitarian crisis.</p>
<h2>Society and Culture</h2>
<p>In Japan, the town of Fujiyoshida has canceled its annual cherry blossom festival due to issues with "overtourism" and problematic behavior by tourists. The decision reflects challenges faced by local communities managing large numbers of visitors during the iconic blossom season, which is an important cultural event but also a source of strain.</p>
