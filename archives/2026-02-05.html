    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 05, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Ukraine's president has reported that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the ongoing conflict with Russia. He also noted that many people are officially missing, suggesting the actual death toll could be significantly higher. This highlights the continuing and severe human cost of the war.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, at least 78 bodies have been buried following a massacre where dozens of Muslims were killed for refusing to join jihadists. There are fears that the death toll may be around 170. This violent incident underscores ongoing security challenges linked to extremist groups in the region.</p>
<h2>Diplomacy and Global Relations</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke with Donald Trump, emphasizing the need for the United States to exercise prudence when supplying arms to Taiwan. This conversation follows a series of visits by Western leaders to China, reflecting a complex diplomatic environment around Taiwan's security.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States has launched a new plan aimed at addressing China's dominance in critical minerals. More than 50 countries participated in this initiative, signaling broad international concern about supply chain security and efforts to diversify sources of essential minerals.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>The situation in Gaza remains difficult, particularly in healthcare. Despite an increase in aid since a ceasefire three months ago, conditions in a Gaza hospital caring for newborn babies are described as struggling. The United Nations warns that the aid reaching the area is still far from sufficient to meet needs.</p>
<p>In Australia, the search continues for four-year-old Gus Lamont, who disappeared while playing outside his home on a remote sheep station in the outback last September. Authorities have now identified a suspect, but details remain limited as the investigation proceeds.</p>
<h2>National Incidents and Social Concerns</h2>
<p>In Australia, a coroner has referred the doctor of Joel Cauchi—the man responsible for the Bondi Junction mass killing—to the health regulator. The inquiry found that the doctor did not adequately respond to warnings about Cauchi's schizophrenia relapse, raising questions about mental health oversight and public safety.</p>
<p>In a personal plea, US news anchor Savannah Guthrie has appealed for the safe return of her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, who has been abducted and is without essential medication. Guthrie emphasized the urgent need for her mother to receive medical treatment.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>British singer Robbie Williams is celebrating a record-breaking success with his new album Britpop, which has surpassed a record previously held by the Beatles. Williams reflected on a cultural tendency among British people to undervalue themselves, marking this achievement as a moment of pride.</p>
