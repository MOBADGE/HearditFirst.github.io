    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>Global Diplomacy and Security</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke with Donald Trump about US arms supplies to Taiwan, urging caution to avoid escalating tensions. This conversation comes amid several recent visits by Western leaders to China, reflecting ongoing efforts to manage complex international relations. Meanwhile, the New Start nuclear treaty between the US and Russia, which limited deployed strategic warheads, has expired. This expiration raises concerns about a potential new arms race, highlighting growing uncertainties around nuclear disarmament and global security.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Violence in Nigeria</h2>
<p>In Nigeria’s western state of Kwara, gunmen attacked two villages, setting fire to shops and homes, resulting in dozens of deaths. This violent episode escalates concerns over regional instability. The situation has prompted confirmation of US military deployment to the area, signaling increased international involvement aimed at addressing the security challenges faced by Nigeria.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement and Justice</h2>
<p>Australian police have charged a man accused of abusing 459 children across more than a dozen countries, allegedly using social media and gaming platforms to target victims. This case underscores ongoing global concerns about online child exploitation. In addition, a doctor who treated Joel Cauchi, involved in a mass killing near Bondi Junction, has been referred to a health regulator after a coroner found that warnings about Cauchi’s schizophrenia relapse were not properly addressed.</p>
<h2>Missing Persons Cases</h2>
<p>Authorities in Australia have identified a suspect in the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont, who went missing last September from a remote sheep station in the outback. In another case, US news anchor Savannah Guthrie has publicly appealed for the return of her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, who was abducted and needs medicine to survive. These ongoing investigations highlight the challenges families face in finding missing loved ones.</p>
<h2>Social Media and Youth Protection</h2>
<p>There is growing attention on regulating children's access to social media. Indian states are reviewing Australia’s legislation that limits social media use among children as part of a broader push to protect young users from potential harm online. This trend reflects increasing global concern about the impact of digital platforms on children and the need for more robust safeguards.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>In Bangladesh, a recent student uprising raised hopes for political change, but established parties are still expected to dominate an upcoming landmark election. This situation indicates a continuing struggle between emerging youth movements and entrenched political forces in shaping the country’s future.</p>
