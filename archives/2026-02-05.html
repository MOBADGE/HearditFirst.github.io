    <h2>Global Diplomacy and Security</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping has advised caution to former US president Donald Trump regarding weapons supplies to Taiwan. The advice came during a phone call on Wednesday, following a series of visits to China by Western leaders in recent months. This exchange highlights ongoing tensions in Taiwan's region and the delicate balance the US seeks in its foreign policy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US and Russia face a shift in nuclear arms control after the expiration of the New Start treaty. The agreement had limited the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads both countries could maintain. Its end raises concerns about a potential new arms race between the two powers.</p>
<h2>Violence and Security Incidents</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, gunmen attacked two villages in Kwara state, killing dozens and setting fire to shops and homes. This violence has been followed by confirmation of US military deployment to the region, underscoring international concern about security in parts of Nigeria.</p>
<p>In Australia, police have identified a suspect connected to the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont, who was last seen in September playing outside a remote sheep station in the outback. The case has attracted significant attention due to its length and location.</p>
<h2>Justice and Legal Matters</h2>
<p>Australian authorities have charged a man with the abuse of 459 children across more than a dozen countries. He allegedly exploited social media and gaming platforms to target victims, highlighting ongoing challenges in global child protection on the internet.</p>
<p>A coroner in Australia has referred the doctor who treated Joel Cauchi, responsible for a mass killing in Bondi Junction, to the health regulator. The doctor reportedly ignored warnings of Cauchi's relapse into schizophrenia. This case raises questions about medical oversight and responsibility.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Public Appeals</h2>
<p>NBC news anchor Savannah Guthrie has made a public plea for the return of her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who is 84 years old and missing without the necessary medicine for survival. This personal appeal brings attention to the human side of abduction cases and the urgency involved.</p>
<p>In India, debate is growing about restricting children’s social media use. Some states are reviewing laws similar to Australia’s recent legislation that limits social media access for children. This reflects increasing global attention to the impacts of digital platforms on youth.</p>
<h2>Politics and Society</h2>
<p>In Bangladesh, a recent student uprising briefly suggested the possibility of political change, but old political parties remain the frontrunners in the country’s upcoming landmark election. This suggests a complex political landscape where youthful movements face entrenched political structures.</p>
<p>In the US, Donald Trump has called for moving on from the Jeffrey Epstein case, despite ongoing public interest and investigation activity by the justice department. The case continues to generate attention and debate regarding accountability and legal follow-up.</p>
