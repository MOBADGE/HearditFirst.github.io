    <h2>Global Diplomacy and Security</h2>
<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke with Donald Trump, emphasizing that the US must be careful when supplying arms to Taiwan. This conversation follows several recent visits by Western leaders to China, signaling ongoing diplomatic efforts amid tensions in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, concerns about nuclear arms have risen as the US-Russia New Start treaty expired. This treaty had placed limits on the number of strategic nuclear warheads both countries could deploy. Its expiration raises fears of a potential new arms race, affecting global security dynamics.</p>
<h2>US Efforts on Critical Minerals</h2>
<p>The United States has launched a new plan aimed at reducing China's dominance in critical minerals. Representatives from over 50 countries attended the event, reflecting broad international interest. Critical minerals are essential for many industries, including technology and defense, making this a significant step for global supply chain security and economic competition.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Criminal News</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, a jihadist group killed dozens of local Muslims who refused to join them. The Nigerian government confirmed these attacks amid escalating violence. This situation led to the confirmation of a US military deployment in the region, highlighting international security concerns.</p>
<p>In Australia, a man has been charged with terrorism after allegedly throwing a homemade bomb at a crowd protesting Australia Day. The attack targeted Aboriginal Australians, showing tensions related to Indigenous rights and public safety.</p>
<p>Additionally, a coroner has referred the doctor who treated Joel Cauchi, the Bondi Junction mass killer, to a health regulator. The verdict found the doctor failed to respond adequately to Cauchi’s schizophrenia relapse before the attack, raising questions about mental health care and public safety.</p>
<h2>Missing Persons Cases</h2>
<p>Two notable disappearances have drawn public attention. Four-year-old Gus Lamont was last seen outside his home on a remote Australian sheep station in late September, and authorities have now identified a suspect in his case.</p>
<p>In the US, Savannah Guthrie, an NBC news anchor, has made a public plea for the return of her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who has been abducted. The 84-year-old needs medication to survive, underscoring urgent human concern and the need for resolution.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Situation in Gaza</h2>
<p>A hospital in Gaza is struggling to care for newborn babies despite a ceasefire that began three months ago. Although more aid has been allowed into the area recently, the United Nations reports that the assistance remains insufficient to meet critical healthcare needs. This highlights ongoing challenges for civilians in conflict zones seeking basic medical care.</p>
