    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Russia and Ukraine have exchanged prisoners, marking the first such swap since October. A total of 157 Ukrainians and 160 Russians were returned to their home countries despite peace talks ending without any major progress. The exchange highlights ongoing attempts to reduce tensions between the two countries, even as diplomatic efforts face challenges.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Lebanon has accused Israel of spraying southern villages with a concentrated herbicide called glyphosate. Israeli officials have declined to comment on the allegation, which involves an area with extensive farmland. This development could affect agricultural communities and relations between the two countries.</p>
<h2>National and Regional Security</h2>
<p>In Nigeria, violence linked to jihadist groups has resulted in the deaths of dozens of Muslims who allegedly refused to join the militants. Authorities have already buried at least 78 victims, with fears that around 170 people might have been killed in total. These attacks remain a serious security concern in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in South Sudan, aid workers are missing following airstrikes that hit a hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). One of the organization's health facilities was also reportedly looted. The situation underscores the risks faced by humanitarian teams operating in conflict-affected areas.</p>
<h2>Legal Investigations and Controversies</h2>
<p>Norwegian police are investigating Thorbjørn Jagland, who has been accused of "aggravated corruption" and have requested a revocation of his immunity. Jagland is reportedly linked to an ongoing inquiry related to Jeffrey Epstein's associates.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has apologized to victims of Jeffrey Epstein, saying he was misled by Peter Mandelson regarding the depth of Mandelson's relationship with Epstein when Starmer was appointed as ambassador to the US. This apology comes amid increased scrutiny of ties related to Epstein.</p>
<p>Also in Israel, Bezalel Zini, who is the brother of an Israeli intelligence chief and an active-duty military reservist, has been charged with smuggling 14 cartons of cigarettes into Gaza in exchange for $117,000. This case highlights issues of corruption and smuggling in sensitive regions.</p>
<h2>Missing Children and Public Safety</h2>
<p>In Australia, a suspect has been identified in the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont, who was last seen playing outside his home on a remote sheep station in September. The case has drawn attention to safety concerns in isolated communities and ongoing efforts to find missing children.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>Japan's city of Fujiyoshida has decided to cancel its annual cherry blossom festival due to problems caused by "overtourism." Local authorities said the influx of tourists during this iconic blossom season had become unmanageable for residents. The decision reflects wider challenges of balancing cultural events with community well-being.</p>
<p>In entertainment news, British singer Robbie Williams celebrated breaking a Britpop record previously set by The Beatles with his new album. Williams remarked on British people's tendency to undervalue themselves, offering a moment of pride for his achievement.</p>
