    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Russia intensified attacks in Ukraine, focusing on a rail hub near Kyiv. Ukrainian President Zelensky called the assault "meaningless from a military point of view," suggesting limited strategic impact. The United States reported progress in talks with Kyiv, signaling ongoing diplomatic efforts amid the conflict.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fighting erupted overnight along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, breaking a fragile ceasefire established in October. Both sides blame each other for starting the clashes, raising concerns about regional stability and the durability of peace agreements.</p>
<p>Kenyan families are calling for urgent action to bring home their sons, who were reportedly lured by lucrative job offers and ended up fighting for Russia. This highlights the broader human impact and international reach of ongoing conflicts.</p>
<h2>Violence and Tragedy</h2>
<p>South Africa witnessed a deadly mass shooting near Pretoria, where gunmen attacked a hostel, killing at least 11 people, including a three-year-old child. The incident has shocked the community and underscores the persistent issues with gun violence in the region.</p>
<p>In Brazil, a fire broke out at São Paulo's airport, engulfing equipment on the tarmac and rapidly spreading to a nearby plane. Authorities evacuated 169 passengers safely, but the incident raised concerns about airport safety and emergency preparedness.</p>
<h2>Public Health Policy</h2>
<p>In the United States, a health advisory panel voted to stop recommending the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. This decision has drawn attention due to former President Trump's support, who described it as "very good," and his directive for the health department to explore further changes to childhood vaccination protocols. The move may influence vaccination practices and public health debates going forward.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Migration</h2>
<p>A report highlighted the grave risks faced by single women migrating to Europe in search of better lives. Esther, a migrant from Nigeria, recounted experiencing sexual violence after fleeing abuse in her home country. The story sheds light on ongoing challenges related to migration, especially the vulnerability of women to exploitation and harm during their journeys.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The world mourns the loss of Frank Gehry, a renowned architect known for his innovative use of jagged angles and industrial materials. Gehry passed away at the age of 96, leaving behind a legacy of influential designs that reshaped contemporary architecture. His work continues to inspire architects and designers globally.</p>
