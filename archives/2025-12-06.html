    <h2>Conflict and Peace Efforts</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Zelensky has expressed determination to continue working with the US on developing a peace plan amid ongoing Russian strikes. This signals potential diplomatic progress despite the continuing conflict. Meanwhile, deadly violence continues elsewhere: at least 50 people were killed in drone strikes on a town in South Kordofan, Sudan, and 11 were killed in a mass shooting at a hostel near Pretoria, South Africa, including a three-year-old. Additionally, overnight fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan broke out along their border, with both sides accusing each other of violating a recent ceasefire.</p>
<h2>Social and Political Developments</h2>
<p>Iran has arrested organisers of a marathon where images showed women competing without wearing hijabs, highlighting ongoing tensions surrounding dress codes and women's rights. In the United States, the Trump administration has announced that Americans will get free entry to national parks on Trump's birthday, but the program will no longer offer free entrance on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth, changing access policies tied to these observances.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Recovery</h2>
<p>A wildfire swept through a coastal area north of Sydney, Australia, damaging multiple homes. Residents described losing everything in the fire, which emphasizes continued challenges with natural disasters in the region. In Washington, DC, National Guardsman Andrew Wolfe is slowly recovering after being shot and remains in acute care with a head wound, highlighting ongoing safety concerns at home.</p>
<h2>Cultural Moments</h2>
<p>In the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, the Christmas tree has been lit for the first time since the start of the Gaza war. For the past two years, all public Christmas celebrations were cancelled, making this event a notable moment of community and tradition returning amid conflict. Meanwhile, the Olympic flame for the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games has arrived in Rome, marking the beginning of preparations for the event scheduled for February.</p>
<p>These developments show a range of global challenges and moments of resilience—from diplomatic efforts and conflict to cultural renewal and preparation for international sporting events.</p>
