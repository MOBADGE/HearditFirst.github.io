    <div class="date">December 06, 2025</div>
    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine, including a strike on a rail hub near Kyiv. Ukrainian President Zelensky described this attack as "meaningless from a military point of view." Despite the continued shelling, the United States reported progress in diplomatic talks with Kyiv, signaling ongoing efforts to find a resolution amid the conflict.</p>
<p>Along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, deadly fighting broke out overnight, breaching a fragile ceasefire that both sides had agreed to in October. Each side accused the other of initiating the clashes, highlighting ongoing tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Violence and Human Rights</h2>
<p>In South Africa, gunmen attacked a hostel near Pretoria, killing at least 11 people, including a three-year-old child. The incident underlines continuing challenges related to violence and security in the area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, single women fleeing difficult circumstances face serious risks during their journeys to Europe. Esther, one refugee, shared her experience of facing sexual violence after escaping abuse in Nigeria, shedding light on the vulnerabilities that migrants and refugees often encounter.</p>
<h2>International Concerns</h2>
<p>Families in Kenya are demanding the return of their sons after learning they were misled with lucrative job offers and ended up fighting for Russia. This situation raises concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable individuals in international conflicts.</p>
<h2>Health and Policy</h2>
<p>A US health panel voted to stop recommending the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The decision was welcomed by former President Trump, who described it as "very good" and instructed the health department to consider further changes to childhood vaccination policies. This marks a significant shift in US public health recommendations.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Accidents</h2>
<p>At São Paulo airport in Brazil, a fire broke out on equipment at the tarmac, quickly spreading and surrounding a plane. Authorities evacuated all 169 passengers safely. The incident caused major disruption but no reported injuries.</p>
<h2>Notable Death</h2>
<p>The architecture world mourns the loss of Frank Gehry, who died aged 96. Gehry was celebrated for his distinctive use of jagged angles and industrial materials in his buildings, leaving a lasting impact on modern architecture.</p>
