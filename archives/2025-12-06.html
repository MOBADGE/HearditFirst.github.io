    <h2>Ukraine-US Peace Talks</h2>
<p>The Ukrainian leader said he is "determined" to keep working with the United States on a peace plan, despite ongoing Russian strikes. This signals some progress in efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict. Continued cooperation with the US could be important for Ukraine as fighting continues, but the situation remains tense.</p>
<h2>Violence in Sudan and South Africa</h2>
<p>A large drone attack on a town in South Kordofan, Sudan, killed at least 50 people. The devastating strike highlights ongoing violence in the region. In South Africa, gunmen attacked a hostel near Pretoria, killing 11 people including a three-year-old child. These incidents underscore persistent security challenges in both countries.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters: Australian Wildfire</h2>
<p>A wildfire swept through a coastal area north of Sydney, damaging multiple homes. Residents described heavy losses as the fire destroyed property. This adds to ongoing concerns about wildfire risks and impacts on communities in Australia.</p>
<h2>Cultural Events and Social Issues</h2>
<p>For the first time since the start of the Gaza war, Bethlehem publicly lit its Christmas tree, reopening celebrations that had been cancelled for two years. Meanwhile, in Iran, marathon organisers were arrested after images showed women running without wearing hijabs. These events reflect ongoing cultural and social tensions in different parts of the world.</p>
<h2>International Border Clashes and Security</h2>
<p>Deadly fighting broke out overnight between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with both sides accusing each other of violating a ceasefire that had been agreed upon in October. The violence threatens to destabilize the fragile peace and complicate relations between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>The Olympic flame for the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games has arrived in Rome ahead of the event in February. In Washington DC, National Guardsman Andrew Wolfe is slowly recovering from a head wound after being shot, and is expected to remain in acute care for several more weeks. In the United States, free entry to national parks will be offered on Donald Trump’s birthday, while free entry on Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth is being withdrawn.</p>
