    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Russia has launched heavy bombardment in Ukraine, targeting a rail hub near Kyiv. Ukrainian President Zelensky described the attack as "meaningless from a military point of view." Meanwhile, the United States said progress has been made in talks with Kyiv, suggesting ongoing diplomatic efforts alongside the conflict. In another security flashpoint, deadly border fighting erupted between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with both sides blaming each other for breaching a ceasefire agreement reached in October. The fighting overnight raises concerns about regional stability.</p>
<h2>Violence and Crime</h2>
<p>A tragic mass shooting occurred near Pretoria, South Africa, where gunmen attacked a hostel, killing at least 11 people, including a three-year-old child. This incident highlights ongoing issues with gun violence and public safety in the region.</p>
<h2>Public Health Policy</h2>
<p>In the United States, a health advisory panel voted to end the recommendation that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine. Former President Trump supported the decision and has directed the health department to explore further changes to childhood vaccination policies. This shift may lead to adjustments in how vaccines are administered to children nationwide, sparking debate about public health priorities.</p>
<h2>Migration and Human Rights</h2>
<p>Reports from Europe reveal the risks faced by single women migrants seeking a better life. Esther, a woman who fled abuse in Nigeria, recounted experiencing sexual violence during her journey. This sheds light on the vulnerabilities of migrants, especially women, and underscores the need for improved protections on migration routes.</p>
<h2>International Families and Conflict</h2>
<p>Kenyan families are demanding the return of their sons who were reportedly lured by lucrative job offers and then forced to fight for Russia. These cases highlight a disturbing pattern of recruitment and exploitation tied to the ongoing conflict involving Russia, and raise questions about the responsibility of governments to protect their citizens abroad.</p>
<h2>Accident and Emergency</h2>
<p>At Brazil’s São Paulo airport, a fire broke out on equipment near the tarmac, rapidly spreading and engulfing a plane in flames and thick smoke. Emergency responders evacuated all 169 passengers safely. The incident underscores the importance of airport safety and emergency preparedness in preventing casualties during unexpected events.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Frank Gehry, the acclaimed architect known for his distinctive use of jagged angles and industrial materials in his designs, has died at the age of 96. Gehry’s work influenced modern architecture worldwide, and his passing marks the loss of a highly regarded creative figure.</p>
