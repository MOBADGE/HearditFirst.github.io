<p>In Syria, a significant ceasefire has been agreed upon between the government, led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, and Kurdish-led forces after two weeks of fighting. The deal aims to allow the Syrian state to reestablish control over most areas affected by conflict, potentially altering the power dynamics in the region.</p>

<h2>Technology and Communications</h2>
