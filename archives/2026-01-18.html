    <h2>International Relations: US Tariff Threats Strain Ties with Europe</h2>
<p>The US president has announced plans to impose a 10% tariff starting in February on several European allies who oppose his attempts to purchase Greenland. European leaders have called this move "unacceptable," highlighting growing tensions over trade and diplomatic relations. The president's approach is described as unprecedented by the BBC’s economics editor, who notes it is likely to confuse allied nations. This development could escalate trade conflicts and complicate cooperation between the US and Europe in the near future.</p>
<h2>Military Deployment: Troops on Standby for Minneapolis Protests</h2>
<p>Authorities report that around 1,500 soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis amid anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests. These troops could be activated if the US president decides to intervene in efforts to control demonstrations. This option reflects ongoing concerns about public order and the government's approach to protest management. The situation remains fluid, and the use of military forces in domestic protests is likely to draw significant public and political attention.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration: NASA's Moon Rocket Ready for Artemis II</h2>
<p>NASA’s new mega Moon rocket has arrived at its launch pad as preparations begin for Artemis II, the first crewed mission to the Moon in over 50 years. This marks a key milestone in revitalizing human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit. The mission aims to build upon earlier Artemis efforts, with broader goals of sustained lunar exploration and potentially sending astronauts to Mars. The arrival at the launch pad signals that the countdown and final technical checks are underway, moving this historic project closer to liftoff.</p>
<h2>Technology and Society: Concerns over Internet Shutdown in Iran</h2>
<p>Internet monitoring group FilterWatch warns that Iran’s authorities are working to disconnect the country from global internet connectivity, potentially leading to severe digital isolation. The move raises fears about the suppression of communication and access to information amid political tensions. An internet blackout on this scale could hinder Iranians’ ability to engage with the outside world and restrict vital channels for news and activism. International observers are closely watching for further developments in Iran’s digital landscape.</p>
<h2>Crime and Safety: Gangland Shooting Shakes Corsica</h2>
<p>A gangland shooting at a funeral on the French island of Corsica has caused shock across the community. The incident draws attention to Corsica’s high murder rate, one of the highest in France, and underlines ongoing challenges with organized crime in the region. This violent episode disrupts the island’s otherwise peaceful reputation and is likely to prompt calls for stronger law enforcement and community safety measures.</p>
<h2>Human Interest: Joyful Tour of Africa by YouTube Star</h2>
<p>A YouTube personality touring Africa expresses deep appreciation for the continent’s vibrant energy and the warmth of its people. Describing this as his first tour of Africa, he emphasizes the strong sense of love and connection he has experienced. This positive portrayal highlights the cultural richness of Africa and offers an uplifting perspective amid more serious global headlines.</p>
