    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 18, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The US president has announced plans to impose a 10% tariff on several European allies beginning in February. This move is linked to opposition from these countries to his proposal to purchase Greenland. European leaders have described the tariff threat as "unacceptable," highlighting heightened tensions between the US and Europe over the issue. Analysts suggest that these actions could strain relations with longtime allies and complicate diplomatic cooperation in the years ahead.</p>
<p>In Syria, government forces have taken control of the country’s largest oil field, Omar, after Kurdish-led militia groups withdrew amid an eastward military push. This gain by the Syrian army may signal a shift in control over key resources within the country, potentially affecting regional power balances and ongoing conflict dynamics.</p>
<h2>Security and Protests</h2>
<p>Around 1,500 soldiers are currently on standby for deployment to Minneapolis. This force could be activated if the US president decides to use them to respond to anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests in the city. Officials indicate this option remains available amid ongoing unrest, raising questions about the potential militarized response to domestic demonstrations.</p>
<h2>Technology and Communications</h2>
<p>Concerns have been raised about Iran’s increasing internet restrictions. Internet monitor FilterWatch warned that Iranian authorities are attempting to sever the country’s connectivity from the international internet. Experts fear this could lead to "extreme digital isolation," further limiting access to information both inside and outside Iran and impacting communication channels during critical times.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>NASA has moved its largest Moon rocket to the launch pad in preparation for the Artemis II mission. This marks the final phase of preparations for the first crewed lunar mission in more than 50 years. The mission represents a major milestone in space exploration, aiming to deepen human presence beyond Earth and potentially pave the way for future expeditions.</p>
<h2>Local and Regional Incidents</h2>
<p>A deadly fire in a large shopping mall in Karachi, Pakistan, has resulted in at least six fatalities. Parts of the plaza collapsed as firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze, highlighting ongoing concerns about safety in densely populated urban centers.</p>
<p>In France, the island of Corsica was shaken by a gangland shooting that took place at a funeral. The incident has drawn attention to Corsica’s notably high murder rates compared to the rest of the country, highlighting underlying social and criminal issues in the region.</p>
