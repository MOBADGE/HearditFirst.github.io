    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>International Relations and Trade Tensions</h2>
<p>The US president has announced plans to impose a 10% tariff starting in February on several European allies who oppose his intention to purchase Greenland. This move has been described by European leaders as "unacceptable." The tariff threat is creating tension among allies and has drawn attention from commentators who say such measures are unprecedented in recent diplomatic relations. The situation highlights ongoing disputes over trade policies and geopolitical interests in the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Security and Protests</h2>
<p>About 1,500 soldiers are currently on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis amid rising tensions linked to anti-ICE protests. An official told CBS News that Donald Trump could authorize their deployment to help manage the demonstrations. This development underscores the government's preparedness to use military personnel to maintain order amid civil unrest related to immigration enforcement policies.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration Progress</h2>
<p>NASA has moved its mega Moon rocket to the launch pad as final preparations begin for the Artemis II mission. This mission will be the first crewed Moon journey in over five decades, marking a major milestone in space exploration. The Artemis II mission is expected to advance scientific understanding of the Moon and pave the way for future off-world missions, reflecting renewed interest in humanity’s return to lunar exploration.</p>
<h2>Internet Restrictions in Iran</h2>
<p>Internet monitoring group FilterWatch has raised concerns about Iran potentially cutting the country off from international internet connections. Authorities appear to be working toward an "extreme digital isolation," which could severely limit access to global communications. This move may impact information flow and connectivity for Iranian residents, with broader implications for freedom of expression and access to news.</p>
<h2>Crime and Violence in Corsica</h2>
<p>The French island of Corsica was recently shaken by a gang-related shooting that occurred at a funeral. The incident draws attention to the island’s notably high murder rate compared to the rest of France. Such violent events highlight ongoing challenges related to organized crime and public safety on the island.</p>
<h2>Cultural Highlights from Africa</h2>
<p>A popular YouTube star touring Africa shared his enthusiasm for the continent’s vibrant energy and the warmth of its people. On his first visit to Africa, he expressed a desire to showcase its culture to the world, capturing moments of joy and deep emotion. This tour reflects a growing global interest in African stories and cultures shared by influential social media figures.</p>
