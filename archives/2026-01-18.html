    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Tensions have risen between the United States and several European countries following a tariff threat by the US president related to Greenland. The president announced plans to impose a 10% tariff starting in February on several European allies who oppose his proposal to purchase Greenland. European leaders have called these threats "unacceptable," signaling significant diplomatic strain. This development has caused confusion among allied nations and could impact transatlantic relations in the near future.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>NASA’s mega Moon rocket has arrived at its launch pad as preparations begin for the Artemis II mission. This upcoming mission marks the first crewed journey to the Moon in over fifty years. The arrival of the rocket is a key milestone for NASA, bringing the space agency closer to its goal of returning astronauts to lunar orbit, which could pave the way for future exploration and sustained human presence on the Moon.</p>
<h2>Domestic Legal Developments in the US</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, a US judge has issued a legal order restricting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from responding in certain ways to planned protests and counter-protests scheduled for the weekend. This ruling comes amid ongoing immigration enforcement actions in the city and aims to manage tension between law enforcement and demonstrators. The decision is expected to influence how immigration issues are handled in the context of public demonstrations, at least in the short term.</p>
<h2>Commentary on US Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>BBC Economics Editor Faisal Islam described the US president’s threats concerning Greenland as "without parallel," highlighting the unusual nature of the president’s approach toward allied nations. Islam suggests that this stance is likely to baffle European leaders, underscoring the unpredictable diplomatic environment created by these tariff threats. This commentary points to broader questions about the future of US alliances and international cooperation.</p>
