    <h2>International Relations and Trade Tensions</h2>
<p>The US president has announced plans to impose a 10% tariff from February on several European allies who have opposed his administration's attempts to buy Greenland. This move has drawn strong criticism from European leaders, who called the tariff threat "unacceptable." The decision escalates tensions between the US and its traditional allies at a time when cooperative relationships are vital. The BBC's economics editor notes that this type of economic threat against close allies is unprecedented, leaving many leaders confused about the US approach.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Response to Protests</h2>
<p>In Minneapolis, approximately 1,500 soldiers are on standby, ready for deployment if the US president decides to use them to control ongoing anti-ICE protests. Officials made this clear as demonstrations continue in response to immigration enforcement actions. The presence of military personnel as a potential response reflects growing concerns over public order but also raises questions about the appropriate use of such forces in civilian protests.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration Progress</h2>
<p>NASA’s massive Moon rocket has arrived at the launch pad in preparation for the Artemis II mission, which will be the first crewed lunar mission in over 50 years. Final checks and preparations are now underway as the agency aims to resume human space exploration beyond Earth’s orbit. This mission marks a significant step in NASA's long-term goal of establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon.</p>
<h2>Internet Shutdown in Iran</h2>
<p>Internet monitor FilterWatch warns that Iranian authorities appear to be increasingly cutting the country off from international internet connectivity in what may be a move toward "digital isolation." This comes amid broader restrictions on communication and information access in Iran. Experts express concern that such shutdowns could become permanent, severely limiting Iranians' ability to access global information and communicate freely.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns in Corsica</h2>
<p>A gangland shooting at a funeral on the French island of Corsica has shocked the community and highlighted the island’s struggle with one of the highest murder rates in mainland France. The violent event brings renewed attention to ongoing issues of crime and security on the island, raising concerns about public safety and the rule of law in the region.</p>
<h2>Weather and Lighthearted Moments</h2>
<p>In Sydney, heavy rain led to flooding of a local golf course, yet one man took the opportunity to swim in the flooded waters. His spontaneous dive brought a lighter moment amid the wet weather, captured in video coverage that has gained attention for its unusual and spirited response to the rain.</p>
