    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 18, 2026</div>
    <h2>Internet Access Concerns in Iran</h2>
<p>Internet monitoring group FilterWatch has raised alarms that Iranian authorities appear to be imposing measures to cut the country off from international internet connectivity. The move risks causing "extreme digital isolation" for the Iranian population. If internet shutdowns expand, this could hinder communications and access to global information, impacting daily life and international relations.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Control of Resources in Syria</h2>
<p>The Syrian army has taken control of the Omar oil field, the country's largest, following the withdrawal of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Government forces advanced eastward to capture this key resource. This development is significant in the ongoing conflict dynamics in Syria, potentially altering power balances and the control of energy resources in the region.</p>
<h2>U.S. Troops on Standby amid Minneapolis Protests</h2>
<p>About 1,500 soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis. This readiness is a response option if former US President Donald Trump chooses to use military forces to address continuing anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests in the city. Officials have not confirmed deployment but stress the military is prepared if needed.</p>
<h2>NASA’s Artemis II Moon Mission Preparation</h2>
<p>NASA's large rocket for the Artemis II mission has arrived at its launch pad. This mission will mark the first crewed trip to the Moon in over 50 years. Final preparations are now underway, signaling a major step forward in renewed lunar exploration efforts and advancing plans for deeper space travel.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fires and Avalanches Cause Loss of Life</h2>
<p>A major fire at a shopping mall in Karachi, Pakistan, has killed six people and caused parts of the building to collapse. Firefighters continue battling the blaze. Meanwhile, in the Austrian Alps, avalanches triggered by heavy snowfall have resulted in eight deaths, contributing to a deadly week of incidents in mountainous areas popular with skiers.</p>
<h2>Violence Strikes French Island of Corsica</h2>
<p>A shocking gangland shooting at a funeral has rattled Corsica, an island known for its relatively peaceful reputation. The incident highlights Corsica's status as having one of the highest murder rates in France, drawing attention to ongoing issues with organized crime and public safety on the island.</p>
