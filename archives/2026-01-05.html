    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in Venezuela as interim president Delcy Rodríguez faces warnings from Donald Trump. Trump stated that Rodríguez could face serious consequences, potentially greater than those experienced by Nicolás Maduro, if she fails to take the right actions. Meanwhile, Cuba’s president reported that Cuban military and intelligence personnel are actively protecting Maduro, who is currently captured. This development highlights the continuing complexity and international involvement in Venezuela’s political crisis.</p>
<h2>United States and Greenland</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reiterated his unusual proposal to annex Greenland, the large Danish-owned island. Trump has expressed a strong interest in making Greenland part of the United States, a move that has raised diplomatic eyebrows. The desire to acquire Greenland signals ongoing strategic considerations by the U.S. regarding Arctic territories and their geopolitical importance.</p>
<h2>South Korea and China Relations</h2>
<p>South Korea's Lee Jae Myung met with Xi Jinping of China, aiming to improve the bilateral relationship. Key topics discussed included trade matters, regional security challenges, and the status of South Korean popular culture, which currently faces an unofficial ban in China. This meeting suggests efforts toward easing tensions and enhancing cooperation between the two nations.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Developments in France</h2>
<p>A Paris court has found ten individuals guilty of cyber-bullying involving Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president. The court described the harassment as "malicious," underlining legal attention to online abuse and its consequences.</p>
<p>Also in France, Sciences Po Saint-Germain, a university near Paris, was featured as a training ground for current and prospective French secret agents. This institution plays a notable role in shaping the country’s intelligence community.</p>
<h2>Tragedy and Culture</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, authorities have identified all 40 victims of a fatal fire at the Le Constellation bar. Among the deceased is a 16-year-old Swiss national, Arthur Brodard, confirmed by his mother. The incident marks a significant tragedy for the local community.</p>
<p>In Japan, a bluefin tuna weighing 243kg was sold for a record $3.2 million at a Tokyo auction. The buyer, known as the Tuna King, declared that the first tuna of the year is a symbol of good luck. This event reflects ongoing cultural traditions and the economic value of prized seafood in Japan.</p>
