    <h2>Venezuela Tensions Rise Amid Court Appearance</h2>
<p>Donald Trump issued a warning to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's interim president, saying she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she "doesn't do what's right." This comment comes as Nicolás Maduro, the captured Venezuelan leader, is set to appear in court. The situation highlights ongoing political instability in Venezuela and the pressures faced by its leadership. Meanwhile, Cuba's president revealed that Cuban military and intelligence officers are actively protecting Maduro, underscoring Cuba's involvement in Venezuelan affairs.</p>
<h2>US-Denmark Relations and Greenland</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reiterated his desire for the United States to annex Greenland, a Danish territory. He has repeatedly expressed interest in making the island part of the US. This ongoing insistence reflects a strategic interest in Greenland, although details about Denmark’s response or potential next steps were not provided. The issue may continue to influence US-Danish diplomatic relations.</p>
<h2>South Korea and China Work to Improve Ties</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung met with China’s Xi Jinping to discuss resetting bilateral relations. Key topics included trade, regional security, and addressing Beijing’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture, which has affected cultural exchanges between the two countries. This meeting signals efforts by both nations to ease tensions and enhance cooperation in a complex regional landscape.</p>
<h2>Tragic Bar Fire in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have identified all 40 victims of the fire at the Le Constellation bar. Among those killed is 16-year-old Arthur Brodard, as confirmed by his mother. The incident has shocked the local community, and investigations are likely ongoing to determine the cause and prevent such tragedies in the future.</p>
<h2>French Spy Training Academy</h2>
<p>Sciences Po Saint-Germain, a university near Paris, serves as a training ground for current French secret agents as well as potential new recruits. The institution plays a crucial role in preparing intelligence personnel, highlighting the importance France places on education and development within its security services. This unique university reflects the blend of academic and practical skills needed for modern espionage.</p>
