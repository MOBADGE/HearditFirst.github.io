    <h2>Venezuela Leader in Court Amidst Political Turmoil</h2>
<p>Nicolás Maduro appeared in a dramatic 40-minute arraignment where he and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drug and weapon charges. The hearing comes as Maduro remains in US custody following his seizure, an action that has sparked sharp criticism both domestically and internationally. The US Attorney General, Pam Bondi, insisted Maduro was brought to the US to "face justice," but the legality of the seizure is being questioned by some experts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump issued a strong warning to Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, saying she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she "doesn't do what's right." Cuba’s president also stated that Cuban military and intelligence operatives are protecting Maduro, highlighting the regional complexity of the situation.</p>
<h2>International Reactions to the Maduro Seizure</h2>
<p>The US’s seizure of Maduro has attracted significant condemnation from a wide range of global actors, including both allies and opponents of the United States. The operation poses serious diplomatic and legal challenges and has complicated relations in the Americas, with concerns over sovereignty and international law being raised.</p>
<h2>Greenland Annexation Proposal</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reiterated his long-standing interest in acquiring Greenland, stating that the island should become part of the United States. This repeated threat to annex the Danish territory underscores ongoing discussions about Greenland’s strategic value, though Denmark has previously rejected such ideas. This development is notable given Greenland’s location and natural resources, which may be factors in the US’s interest.</p>
<h2>South Korea and China Seek to Improve Relations</h2>
<p>South Korea’s leader, Lee Jae Myung, met with China’s Xi Jinping to discuss efforts to reset ties between the two countries. Key issues on the agenda included trade relations, regional security concerns, and Beijing’s informal restrictions on Korean pop culture. The talks come amid growing regional tensions and highlight the importance of diplomacy in East Asia.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>In Paris, a court found ten individuals guilty of malicious cyberbullying directed at Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president.</p>
<p>This marks a significant case addressing online harassment.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, investigators identified all 116 people injured in a New Year’s Eve fire in a busy bar in Crans-Montana, which killed 40.</p>
<p>The tragedy remains a sobering reminder of the need for public safety measures.</p>
<p>Finally, a rare bluefin tuna sold for a record $3.2 million at a Tokyo auction, bought by a buyer known as the Tuna King.</p>
<p>The purchase is seen as a hopeful sign, with the buyer suggesting the first tuna of the year brings good luck.</p>
