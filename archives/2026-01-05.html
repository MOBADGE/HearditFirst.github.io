    <h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's interim president, stating she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she fails to "do what's right." This comes as Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela's leader, is expected to appear in court soon. The situation underscores ongoing tensions and international focus on Venezuela’s political leadership.</p>
<h2>Nordic Relations and Greenland</h2>
<p>Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen responded firmly to what she described as “threats” from the United States regarding Greenland. She emphasized that the U.S. has no right to annex any part of the Danish kingdom, which includes Greenland and two other nations. This statement highlights the sensitivity around territorial sovereignty in the Arctic region and could influence future diplomatic relations between Denmark and the U.S.</p>
<h2>East Asian Diplomacy</h2>
<p>South Korea’s Lee Jae Myung is set to meet with China’s Xi Jinping in an effort to reset relations between the two countries. Key topics will include trade issues, regional security concerns, and China’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. This meeting could shape the future of economic and cultural exchanges, as well as address geopolitical challenges in East Asia.</p>
<h2>Incident in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have identified all 40 victims of a tragic fire at the Le Constellation bar. Among those who died is 16-year-old Arthur Brodard, a Swiss national, as confirmed by his mother. This incident has deeply affected the local community and highlighted the urgent need for fire safety and emergency preparedness.</p>
<h2>French Intelligence Training</h2>
<p>Near Paris, the Sciences Po Saint-Germain university serves as a training center for current and prospective French secret agents. This institution focuses on developing skills and knowledge crucial for national intelligence work in France. Its role reflects the ongoing importance of formal education and specialized training in modern espionage and security services.</p>
