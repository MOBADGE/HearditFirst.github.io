    <h2>Venezuela's Maduro Pleads Not Guilty in Court</h2>
<p>Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, appeared in court for a 40-minute arraignment where they pleaded not guilty to charges involving drugs and weapons. Maduro described himself as a "prisoner of war" during the hearing. This court appearance follows the U.S. seizure of Maduro, which has sparked significant controversy internationally.</p>
<h2>International Reactions and Legal Concerns Over Maduro's Seizure</h2>
<p>The United States has faced criticism from both allies and adversaries over its capture of Nicolás Maduro. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Maduro was brought to the U.S. to "face justice," but some legal experts have raised questions about the operation’s legality within the U.S. and international law. Meanwhile, former U.S. President Donald Trump warned Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, that she could face harsh consequences if she does not "do what's right" in relation to Maduro's case.</p>
<h2>Cuba Reports Losses During Attack Related to Maduro</h2>
<p>Cuba's president reported that 32 Cuban personnel were killed during a U.S. attack connected to Venezuela. Cuban military and intelligence operatives have been involved in providing protection to Maduro. This highlights the regional tensions and the interconnected roles of Cuba and Venezuela in recent events.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Efforts in East Asia</h2>
<p>In East Asia, South Korean politician Lee Jae Myung met with China's leader Xi Jinping to discuss improving bilateral relations. Their talks focused on trade issues, regional security, and concerns related to China's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. These discussions represent efforts to reset ties amid complex geopolitical dynamics in the region.</p>
<h2>Other International News</h2>
<p>A Paris court convicted ten people for the cyber-bullying of Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president, marking a judicial response to online harassment. In Switzerland, all 116 individuals injured in a New Year’s Eve bar fire in Crans-Montana have now been identified; the fire resulted in 40 fatalities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Japan, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold for a record $3.2 million at Tokyo’s New Year auction. The buyer, known as the Tuna King, said the first tuna of the year symbolizes good luck. Additionally, former U.S. President Trump again expressed interest in annexing Greenland, a Danish territory, continuing a long-standing U.S. policy debate.</p>
