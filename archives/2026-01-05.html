    <h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>The political situation in Venezuela remains tense as Nicolás Maduro faces an upcoming court appearance. Former U.S. president Donald Trump issued a warning to Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, suggesting she could face harsher consequences than Maduro if she does not "do what's right." Meanwhile, Cuba's president reported that Cuban military and intelligence personnel are still involved in protecting Maduro, underscoring the ongoing international dimensions of the Venezuelan crisis.</p>
<h2>U.S. Relations and Territory</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reiterated his longstanding interest in Greenland, once again suggesting the United States should annex the Danish territory. This statement highlights ongoing discussions and tensions about U.S. strategic interests in the Arctic region. Greenland’s status as part of Denmark brings diplomatic complexity to these comments.</p>

<h2>Tragedy in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have identified all 40 victims of a deadly fire at the Le Constellation bar. Among those killed was 16-year-old Arthur Brodard, confirmed by his mother. The incident has prompted mourning and investigations into the causes of the blaze.</p>
<h2>Unusual Auction News from Japan</h2>
<p>A record-breaking bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold for $3.2 million at Tokyo's first fish auction of the year. The buyer, known as the Tuna King, expressed optimism by saying "the year's first tuna brings good luck." This sale underlines the cultural importance and economic value of tuna in Japan.</p>
<h2>Intelligence Training in France</h2>
