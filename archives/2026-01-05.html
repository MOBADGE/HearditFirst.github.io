    <h2>Venezuela Crisis Developments</h2>
<p>Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader, appeared in a US court where he and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drug and weapon charges. The arraignment lasted about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, an interim president for Venezuela was sworn in, signaling an ongoing power struggle. Delcy Rodríguez, who took a key role supporting the new leadership, expressed distress over Maduro and his wife’s situation, calling it a “kidnapping.” Former US president Donald Trump issued a warning to Rodríguez, suggesting she might face severe consequences if she does not act “right.”</p>
<h2>Violence and Casualties in Venezuela and Cuba</h2>
<p>The conflict surrounding Maduro’s capture has resulted in significant loss of life. Cuba’s president reported that 32 Cuban nationals were killed during a US attack on Venezuela. Cuban military and intelligence personnel have been involved in efforts to protect Maduro. The situation has created uncertainty about Cuba's future, given its close ties to Maduro’s government.</p>
<h2>Court Verdict in France</h2>
<p>In Paris, a court convicted ten people of cyberbullying against Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president. The court ruled their actions “malicious,” marking a notable legal move against online harassment of public figures’ families.</p>
<h2>Fire Tragedy in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Authorities in Switzerland have identified all 116 individuals injured in a New Year’s Eve fire at a busy bar in the ski resort town of Crans-Montana. The fire claimed the lives of 40 people, making it one of the deadliest recent disasters in the country’s resort areas.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Talks in East Asia</h2>
<p>South Korean politician Lee Jae Myung met with China’s Xi Jinping to discuss improving relations. Topics on the agenda included trade issues, regional security, and Beijing’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture exports. This meeting reflects efforts to reset diplomatic ties amid ongoing tensions.</p>
<h2>Other Noteworthy Events</h2>
<p>In Tokyo, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold for a record $3.2 million at a New Year auction. The buyer, known as the Tuna King, said the fish symbolizes good luck for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Separately, former US president Donald Trump repeated his long-standing interest in acquiring Greenland as a US territory, underscoring ongoing discussions about the island’s strategic importance.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These events represent a mix of political, social, and cultural developments around the world, highlighting tensions in Latin America, legal actions in Europe, environmental tragedies, and diplomatic efforts in Asia.</p>
