    <h2>US-Venezuela Tensions Escalate</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and Venezuela have intensified after the US took custody of Venezuela's leader Nicolás Maduro. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro was brought to the US to "face justice," though some legal experts have expressed concerns about the operation's legality both domestically and internationally. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, stating she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she does not "do what's right." Cuba's president responded by saying that Cuban military and intelligence operatives had been providing protection to Maduro, emphasizing Cuba's involvement in the situation.</p>
<h2>Greenland and US-Denmark Relations</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reiterated his repeated interest in annexing Greenland, the large Danish territory. He has long expressed a desire for Greenland to become part of the United States, renewing speculation about potential geopolitical moves involving the island. This issue remains a point of discussion in US-Danish relations, though no official negotiations or agreements have been reported at this time.</p>
