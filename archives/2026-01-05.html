    <h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump has issued a warning to Venezuela's interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, suggesting she could face consequences "bigger than Maduro" if she fails to act appropriately. This comes as the current Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, is set to appear in court. Meanwhile, Cuba’s president reported that Cuban military and intelligence personnel have been protecting Maduro, highlighting continued Cuban involvement in Venezuela's political situation.</p>
<h2>US and Greenland Relations</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reiterated his interest in Greenland, the Danish territory, expressing a desire for it to become part of the United States. This insistence on annexation adds to ongoing discussions about the strategic importance of Greenland, though it remains part of Denmark. The repeated calls for this change underscore tensions in US-Danish relations and raise questions about future talks between the countries.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Efforts in East Asia</h2>
<p>South Korea’s leader Lee Jae Myung met with China’s Xi Jinping to discuss several key issues, including trade relations, regional security matters, and Beijing’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. These talks reflect Seoul’s aim to improve bilateral ties with Beijing amid complex geopolitical challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues in France</h2>
<p>A Paris court convicted ten individuals for cyberbullying Brigitte Macron, wife of the French president. The court described their actions as "malicious," signaling a stance against online harassment of public figures and raising awareness about digital abuse.</p>
<h2>Tragedy in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have identified all 40 victims of a deadly fire that occurred at the Le Constellation bar. Among the deceased is 16-year-old Arthur Brodard, confirmed by his mother. The incident marks a significant loss for the local community and raises concerns about fire safety regulations.</p>
<h2>Unique Cultural Note</h2>
<p>At a recent auction in Tokyo, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold for a record $3.2 million to a buyer known as the Tuna King. He remarked that the year's first tuna typically brings good luck, highlighting cultural traditions tied to this event.</p>
