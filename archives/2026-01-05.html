    <h2>Venezuela's Leadership Crisis</h2>
<p>Venezuela is experiencing a major political upheaval as Nicolás Maduro, the nation's leader, appeared in a US court to plead not guilty to drug and weapon charges. The arraignment lasted 40 minutes and also involved his wife, Cilia Flores, who entered similar pleas. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, was sworn in amid this turmoil. Rodríguez condemned what she described as the "kidnapping" of Maduro and his wife. This dramatic situation has heightened tensions both within Venezuela and internationally.</p>
<h2>International Reactions and US Involvement</h2>
<p>The United States has faced significant criticism for the seizure of Maduro, with disapproval coming from both allies and opponents. Former US President Donald Trump issued a warning to Delcy Rodríguez, stating she could face severe consequences if she does not act appropriately. The situation has caused alarm in Cuba, a close ally of Maduro, where the president confirmed that military and intelligence personnel are protecting the captured Venezuelan leader. The uncertain political future for Cuba reflects the broader instability caused by recent events in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Human Toll and Regional Security Concerns</h2>
<p>The recent conflict surrounding Venezuela has resulted in the deaths of 32 Cuban nationals during a US attack on Venezuelan territory. This loss has further strained relations between the countries involved and underscores the risk of increasing violence connected to the ongoing political crisis. Cuba’s defiant stance as it prepares for what could be a post-Maduro era highlights concerns over regional stability and security.</p>
<h2>Other International News Highlights</h2>
<p>In France, a Paris court found ten people guilty of cyberbullying Brigitte Macron, the spouse of the French president, for actions described as "malicious." In Switzerland, authorities identified all 116 people injured in a New Year’s Eve fire at a ski resort bar in Crans-Montana, where 40 people died. These incidents mark tragic and consequential events across Europe.</p>
<h2>Economic and Cultural Events</h2>
<p>In Japan’s Tokyo fish market, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold for a record $3.2 million. The buyer, known as the Tuna King, remarked that the first tuna of the year brings good luck, reflecting a cultural tradition that draws international attention.</p>
<h2>US and Greenland Relations</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, former US President Trump reiterated his long-standing threat to annex Greenland, the massive Danish territory. He emphasized the strategic importance of the island to the United States, continuing a controversial stance that has implications for US-Denmark relations.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This snapshot of today’s news highlights complex political shifts in Latin America, notable legal rulings in Europe, and ongoing international economic and territorial interests. The situation in Venezuela continues to evolve, with significant consequences for the region and beyond.</p>
