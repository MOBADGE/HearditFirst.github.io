    <h2>International Tensions in Venezuela and Cuba</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high around Venezuela following recent developments involving its leadership. The interim Venezuelan president, Delcy Rodríguez, has been warned by Donald Trump that she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she does not act properly. Meanwhile, Nicolás Maduro, the captured leader of Venezuela, is expected to appear in court. The Cuban president reported that 32 Cuban military and intelligence personnel, who were assisting Maduro, were killed during a U.S. attack on Venezuela. These events could further complicate political and military dynamics in the region.</p>
<h2>U.S. Interest in Greenland</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reiterated his desire for the United States to acquire Greenland, a Danish territory. He has previously expressed interest in making the island part of the U.S., emphasizing its strategic importance. This renewed statement could impact relations between the U.S. and Denmark, especially given Greenland's geopolitical value.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Efforts in East Asia</h2>
<p>South Korean politician Lee Jae Myung met with China's leader, Xi Jinping, in an effort to reset ties between their countries. Discussions focused on trade, regional security issues, and China's ongoing unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. This meeting highlights attempts to ease tensions and strengthen cooperation in East Asia amid complex regional challenges.</p>
<h2>French Court Convicts Cyber-Bullies</h2>
<p>A Paris court found ten individuals guilty of malicious cyber-bullying directed at Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president. The ruling underscores ongoing challenges with online harassment and the legal consequences of such behavior in France.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Authorities in Switzerland have identified all 40 victims of a devastating fire at the Le Constellation bar. Among the victims was 16-year-old Arthur Brodard, confirmed by his mother. The incident marks a tragic loss and will likely prompt questions about fire safety and prevention measures in such venues.</p>
<h2>Culture and Commerce Highlights</h2>
<p>In Tokyo, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold at auction for a record $3.2 million. The buyer, known as the "Tuna King," described the purchase of the year's first tuna as a sign of good luck. This event reflects the cultural and commercial significance of the seafood industry in Japan.</p>
<p>Separately, near Paris, Sciences Po Saint-Germain continues to be a key institution for training France’s current and future secret agents. The university plays a significant role in preparing intelligence personnel for national security roles.</p>
