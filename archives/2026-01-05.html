    <h2>Venezuela Crisis and Maduro's Court Appearance</h2>
<p>Nicolás Maduro, the captured Venezuelan leader, appeared in a court arraignment where he and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to charges related to drugs and weapons. The hearing lasted about 40 minutes, during which Maduro described himself as a "prisoner of war." Meanwhile, Cuba’s president reported that Cuban military and intelligence personnel are involved in protecting Maduro. The event is part of a larger international controversy, as the United States' role in seizing Maduro has drawn criticism from both allies and adversaries. Some legal experts are questioning the implications of this extraterritorial arrest, even as US officials stress the importance of bringing Maduro to justice.</p>
<h2>Tensions Rise Over Leadership in Venezuela</h2>
<p>As Maduro appears in court, former US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez. Trump suggested Rodríguez could face consequences possibly worse than Maduro’s if she does not act correctly in the matter. This public warning underscores the ongoing geopolitical tensions surrounding Venezuela’s political future and the shifting power dynamics in the region.</p>
<h2>Cuban Concerns Amid Venezuelan Turmoil</h2>
<p>Cuba, a key ally of Maduro's Venezuela, is facing uncertain times with Maduro's capture. The Cuban leadership is bracing for what it terms a "post-Maduro era," which they regard bleak. The involvement of Cuban operatives in protecting Maduro further ties Cuba’s fate to Venezuela’s ongoing crisis. The broader impacts on the region and Cuba’s stability remain uncertain.</p>
<h2>Swiss Ski Resort Fire Aftermath</h2>
<p>On a different note, the victims of the recent fire at a ski resort in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, have all been identified. The blaze, which occurred on New Year’s Eve, resulted in the deaths of 40 people and injured 116 more. The community and authorities continue to process the tragedy and its effects on the local area during what should be a festive season.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Tokyo, a 243-kilogram bluefin tuna sold for a record-breaking $3.2 million at an auction, purchased by a buyer known as the Tuna King. The buyer said the first tuna of the year symbolizes good luck. Additionally, in Denmark, former US President Trump reiterated his repeated interest in Greenland, a Danish territory, which he has suggested the US should annex. In France, a court found ten individuals guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president, citing "malicious" behavior.</p>
