    <h2>Venezuela Leader Faces Court Hearing</h2>
<p>Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, appeared in court during a 40-minute arraignment where they pleaded not guilty to charges related to drugs and weapons. Maduro described himself as a "prisoner of war" during the hearing. This court case marks a significant moment amid ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela, with potential implications for the country's leadership and international relations.</p>
<h2>Political Tensions and US Criticism</h2>
<p>The situation surrounding Venezuela's leadership has drawn sharp criticism globally. The United States' seizure of Maduro has been condemned by both allies and adversaries, signaling widespread concern over the approach taken. Additionally, former US President Trump warned Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela’s interim president, suggesting she could face severe consequences if she "doesn't do what's right." These developments highlight the complex and volatile political environment in the region.</p>
<h2>Cuba and Venezuela's Strained Future</h2>
<p>Cuba, a close ally of Maduro’s Venezuela, is preparing for uncertain times following the events around Venezuela's leadership. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel announced that Cuban military and intelligence personnel are protecting Maduro while he is detained. However, the future looks bleak for Cuba, which has long depended on its alliance with Venezuela for economic and political support. This shift could lead to significant regional changes.</p>
<h2>International Relations in Asia</h2>
<p>In East Asia, South Korea’s Lee Jae Myung met with China’s Xi Jinping to discuss key issues including trade, regional security, and cultural tensions, such as Beijing’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. This meeting reflects efforts to reset and stabilize relations between the two countries amid ongoing diplomatic challenges.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>In France, ten individuals were found guilty by a Paris court of malicious cyberbullying targeting Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a tragic fire at a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve resulted in 40 deaths and left 116 injured, all of whom have now been identified.</p>
<p>Lastly, in Japan, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kg sold for a record $3.2 million at the Tokyo auction.</p>
<p>The buyer, known as the Tuna King, expressed optimism that the year’s first tuna would bring good luck.</p>
<p>These events illustrate ongoing political unrest, international diplomacy, and human interest stories shaping the early part of 2026.</p>
