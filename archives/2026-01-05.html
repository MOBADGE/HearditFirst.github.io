    <h2>Venezuela and US Relations</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US and Venezuela remain high following the recent seizure of Nicolás Maduro. US Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Maduro was brought to the US to "face justice," but legal experts have raised concerns over the implications of his capture. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump issued a warning to Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, saying she could “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she “doesn't do what's right.” Cuba’s president condemned the US attack, reporting that 32 Cubans were killed during the operation and noting that Cuban military and intelligence operatives were protecting Maduro.</p>
<h2>US Interest in Greenland</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reiterated his desire for Greenland to become part of the United States. He has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing the Danish territory, emphasizing the strategic importance of the island. This stance continues to attract international attention and could impact US-Danish relations going forward.</p>
<h2>Asia-Pacific Diplomacy</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung met with China’s Xi Jinping as part of efforts to reset diplomatic ties between Seoul and Beijing. Their discussions covered trade, regional security, and the controversy surrounding China’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. This meeting signals a potential thaw in relations that have been strained in recent years.</p>
<h2>Legal Actions in France</h2>
<p>A Paris court found ten people guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president. The court ruled their actions as "malicious" bullying. This case highlights ongoing concerns about online harassment and the legal consequences for those involved.</p>
<h2>Tragedy in Swiss Ski Resort</h2>
<p>Authorities have identified all 116 people injured in a devastating fire at a ski resort bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. The blaze, which occurred on New Year's Eve, killed 40 people. Investigations and safety reviews are expected as the community mourns the loss.</p>
<h2>Unique News from Japan</h2>
<p>In Tokyo’s annual first auction of the year, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold for a record $3.2 million. The buyer, known as the Tuna King, said that “the year's first tuna brings good luck,” underlining the cultural significance of the event in Japan.</p>
