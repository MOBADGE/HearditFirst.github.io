    <h2>Venezuela's Leader Appears in Court</h2>
<p>Nicolás Maduro appeared in court for a 40-minute arraignment where he and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges. Maduro described himself as a "prisoner of war," highlighting the tense atmosphere around the hearing. This court case marks a significant moment in the ongoing crisis surrounding Venezuela's leadership and international relations.</p>
<h2>US Seizure of Maduro Sparks Controversy</h2>
<p>The United States has taken custody of Nicolás Maduro, prompting sharp criticism from allies and adversaries alike. US Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Maduro was brought to the US to "face justice." However, legal experts have raised questions about the legality and implications of this action both within the US and internationally. The incident has further complicated diplomatic ties and raised concerns over international law.</p>
<h2>Regional Reactions and Tensions</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump warned Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, that she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she does not act appropriately. Meanwhile, Cuba's president confirmed that Cuban military and intelligence personnel are actively protecting Maduro, underscoring Cuba's close alliance with Venezuela. However, the outlook for Cuba appears uncertain as it prepares for a post-Maduro era, with concerns about its political and economic future.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Swiss Ski Resort</h2>
<p>A fire at a busy bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, on New Year's Eve killed 40 people and injured 116 others. Authorities have since identified all the injured, providing some closure after the tragic event. The incident has drawn attention to fire safety in crowded venues and sparked calls for improved preventive measures to avoid similar disasters.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Headlines</h2>
<p>In Paris, ten individuals were found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president, in a case described as involving "malicious" harassment. In Tokyo, a 243-kilogram bluefin tuna was sold for a record $3.2 million at an auction. The buyer, known as the Tuna King, said the first tuna of the year is believed to bring good luck. Lastly, former US president Trump reiterated his repeated desire for the United States to annex Greenland, continuing a controversial political stance on the Danish territory.</p>
