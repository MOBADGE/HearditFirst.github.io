    <h2>Venezuela Political Tensions</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela’s interim president, as Nicolás Maduro, the country's leader, is scheduled to appear in court. Trump suggested Rodríguez could face serious consequences, possibly more severe than Maduro’s, if she fails to “do what’s right.” This highlights ongoing political instability in Venezuela and continues to draw international attention. The situation may develop depending on the court proceedings involving Maduro and the actions of other Venezuelan officials.</p>
<h2>Swiss Bar Fire Tragedy</h2>
<p>Authorities in Switzerland have identified all 40 victims of a devastating fire at Le Constellation bar. Among those who lost their lives is a 16-year-old Swiss national, Arthur Brodard, as confirmed by his mother. This tragedy has deeply affected the local community and raises questions about safety regulations in public venues. Investigations into the cause of the fire are likely to continue, with potential implications for fire safety standards.</p>
<h2>Greenland Dispute</h2>
<p>Mette Frederiksen, the Prime Minister of Denmark, responded to statements made by Donald Trump about Greenland by firmly rejecting any U.S. claim over the island. Frederiksen emphasized that the United States has no right to annex any parts of the Danish kingdom, which includes Greenland and two other territories. This exchange underscores ongoing diplomatic tensions between Denmark and the U.S. regarding sovereignty and territorial rights in the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>South Korea-China Relations</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung is set to meet with China’s Xi Jinping to discuss efforts to reset bilateral relations. Key topics will include trade, regional security, and Beijing’s informal restrictions on Korean pop culture. This meeting could mark a significant step toward improving ties between the two countries, which have faced challenges in recent years. Outcomes may impact economic cooperation and cultural exchanges moving forward.</p>
<h2>French Spy Training School</h2>
<p>Near Paris, Sciences Po Saint-Germain serves as a training center for French intelligence agents and prospective recruits. This institution is known for equipping spies with skills necessary for national security work. Its role reflects France’s ongoing commitment to maintaining and developing its intelligence capabilities in a complex global environment. The school’s activities offer insight into how countries prepare their security personnel for modern challenges.</p>
