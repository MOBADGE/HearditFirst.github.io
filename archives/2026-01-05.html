    <h2>International Tensions in Venezuela and the US</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump issued a warning to Delcy Rodríguez, who is acting as Venezuela's interim president, saying she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she "doesn't do what's right." This statement came as Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela's captured leader, was expected to appear in court. In related developments, Cuba's president reported that 32 Cubans, including military and intelligence operatives, were killed during a US attack in Venezuela. These operatives had been providing protection to Maduro. The situation highlights ongoing tensions involving Venezuela, the US, and Cuba.</p>
<h2>US Interest in Greenland</h2>
<p>Donald Trump also reiterated his desire for Greenland to become part of the United States, a position he has expressed multiple times. Greenland is a Danish territory, and the US president’s comments continue to raise questions about future territorial and diplomatic relations between the US and Denmark.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Talks Between South Korea and China</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in efforts to renew and improve ties. Their discussions focused on critical issues including trade, regional security, and China’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. The meeting signals a potential shift in regional dynamics and economic cooperation in East Asia.</p>
<h2>Cyberbullying Case in France</h2>
<p>A Paris court found ten individuals guilty of "malicious" cyberbullying targeted at Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president. This legal ruling sheds light on the growing issue of online harassment, especially involving public figures.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Authorities in Switzerland identified all 40 victims of a fire that broke out in a bar called Le Constellation. The victims included a 16-year-old Swiss national named Arthur Brodard, as confirmed by his mother. The incident has been a major tragedy and investigation continues into the cause and circumstances surrounding the fire.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Economic Highlights</h2>
<p>In Tokyo, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms was sold at auction for a record $3.2 million. The buyer, known as the "Tuna King," commented that the first tuna of the year brings good luck, underscoring the cultural significance of the annual auction in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in France, Sciences Po Saint-Germain near Paris, a university known for training current and future French intelligence agents, continues its unique role in preparing individuals for careers in espionage. This institution remains a notable example of specialized education linked to national security matters.</p>
