    <h2>Venezuela Political Crisis</h2>
<p>Venezuela's political situation escalated as Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, appeared in a US courtroom on drug and weapon charges, both pleading not guilty. The arraignment lasted 40 minutes and drew international attention. Meanwhile, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, was sworn in amid the turmoil. Rodríguez expressed anguish over what she called the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife. Former US president Donald Trump warned Rodríguez that she could face severe consequences if she does not “do what’s right,” suggesting she might pay a “very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” Cuba, a close ally of Maduro, said 32 Cubans were killed during what it described as a US attack on Venezuela and stated that Cuban military and intelligence operatives remain involved in protecting Maduro.</p>
<h2>Cuba Faces Uncertain Future</h2>
<p>As Venezuela’s crisis deepens, Cuba is preparing for significant changes. The Cuban government, a steadfast supporter of Maduro, is facing bleak prospects in a potential post-Maduro era. The country is bracing for the consequences of diminished Venezuelan support, which has long been critical to its economy and political alliance in the region. Cuban authorities emphasized their ongoing support for Maduro despite the turmoil.</p>
<h2>Judicial Outcomes in France</h2>
<p>In Paris, a court ruled against ten individuals found guilty of “malicious” cyber-bullying targeting Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president. The case highlights growing legal actions against online harassment and the protection of public figures from digital abuse.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Engagements in Asia</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in an effort to improve relations. The discussions focused on trade, regional security, and Beijing’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture, a key area affecting cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Notable Events: Record Tuna Sale and Swiss Fire Tragedy</h2>
<p>In Tokyo, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold for a record $3.2 million at auction. The buyer, known as the Tuna King, said the first tuna of the year brings good luck. In Switzerland, authorities confirmed the identities of all 116 people injured in a fire that broke out on New Year’s Eve at a bar in the Crans-Montana ski resort. The fire caused 40 deaths, marking a tragic start to the year for the community.</p>
