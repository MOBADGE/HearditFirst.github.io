    <h2>International Relations and Tensions</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump has issued a warning to Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, saying she could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she fails to "do what's right." Meanwhile, Venezuela’s leader Nicolás Maduro is expected to appear in court soon, though Cuba's president has reported that Cuban military and intelligence personnel are providing protection to Maduro, highlighting ongoing international involvement in the Venezuelan crisis.</p>
<p>In addition, Trump has reiterated his longstanding desire for the United States to annex Greenland, a Danish territory. He has previously expressed the intention to make the island part of the US, underscoring a continuing focus on territorial ambitions in the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Engagement in East Asia</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung met with China’s Xi Jinping in an effort to reset bilateral ties. The agenda centered on trade issues, regional security concerns, and the impact of China’s unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. This meeting signals attempts to ease tensions and foster cooperation between the two countries amid broader geopolitical challenges in East Asia.</p>
<h2>Legal and Criminal Developments</h2>
<p>A Paris court has found ten individuals guilty of cyberbullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president. They were convicted for engaging in "malicious" online harassment, reflecting increasing legal scrutiny on cyberbullying and the protection of public figures from digital abuse.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have identified all 40 victims of a deadly fire that broke out at Le Constellation bar. Among those who perished is Arthur Brodard, a 16-year-old Swiss national, confirmed by his mother. The incident has marked a somber moment for the Swiss community, with investigations continuing into the cause and circumstances of the blaze.</p>
<h2>Culture and Economy Highlights</h2>
<p>In Tokyo, a bluefin tuna weighing 243 kilograms sold for a record $3.2 million at an auction, purchased by a man nicknamed the "Tuna King." He described the acquisition as bringing good luck for the year ahead. This event highlights the ongoing significance of tuna auctions in Japan’s seafood industry.</p>
<p>Separately, Sciences Po Saint-Germain near Paris, a French university known for training spies, continues to educate current French secret agents and recruit potential new members. This institution plays an important role in preparing intelligence personnel for France’s security services.</p>
