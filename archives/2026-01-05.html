    <h2>Venezuela and US Tensions</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump issued a warning to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's interim president, saying she could face harsh consequences—potentially even more severe than those for Nicolás Maduro—if she does not "do what's right." This comes as Maduro is set to appear in court, intensifying a volatile political situation in Venezuela. Meanwhile, Cuba's president stated that Cuban military and intelligence personnel are actively providing protection to Maduro. The involvement of Cuban operatives underscores the international dimension of the Venezuelan crisis.</p>
<h2>Tragic Swiss Bar Fire</h2>
<p>Authorities in Switzerland have identified all 40 victims of a deadly fire at the Le Constellation bar. Among the deceased is Arthur Brodard, a 16-year-old Swiss national, whose mother confirmed his death. The incident has caused national mourning and raises questions about fire safety and emergency response in public venues.</p>
<h2>Greenland and US-Denmark Relations</h2>
<p>Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen spoke out against perceived threats from former President Trump regarding Greenland. She firmly stated that the United States has no right to annex any part of the three nations that compose the Danish kingdom, which includes Greenland. This firm response highlights ongoing sensitivities about territorial sovereignty and diplomatic relations in the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>South Korea and China to Improve Ties</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung plans to meet with China’s Xi Jinping to work on resetting diplomatic relations between the two countries. Key topics expected to be discussed include trade, regional security, and China's unofficial ban on South Korean pop culture. This meeting could influence economic cooperation and cultural exchange in East Asia amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>French Intelligence Training</h2>
<p>Sciences Po Saint-Germain, a university near Paris, is known for training current and prospective French secret agents. The institution offers specialized education aimed at preparing professionals for careers in intelligence and national security. This insight into France’s approach to intelligence underscores the importance placed on formal training for security roles.</p>
