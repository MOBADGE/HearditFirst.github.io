    <h2>Venezuela Crisis and US Warning</h2>
<p>Former U.S. president Donald Trump has issued a warning to Delcy Rodríguez, who is serving as Venezuela’s interim president. He said Rodríguez could "pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro" if she fails to "do what’s right." Meanwhile, Nicolás Maduro, the current Venezuelan leader, is expected to appear in court soon. The situation remains tense as political power struggles continue in Venezuela.</p>
<h2>Cuban Involvement in Venezuela Conflict</h2>
<p>Cuba's president has revealed that Cuban military and intelligence personnel are actively protecting Nicolás Maduro, who has been captured amid ongoing conflict. This involvement highlights Cuba’s role in the Venezuelan crisis and introduces an international dimension to the unfolding events.</p>
<h2>Swiss Bar Fire Tragedy</h2>
<p>Authorities in Switzerland have identified all 40 victims killed in the fire at the Le Constellation bar. Among the deceased is Arthur Brodard, a 16-year-old Swiss national, confirmed by his mother. The community continues to mourn as investigations into the cause and circumstances of the blaze proceed.</p>
<h2>Greenland and Danish-US Relations</h2>
<p>Denmark’s Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, has criticized Donald Trump over statements perceived as threats concerning Greenland. Frederiksen stressed that the United States has no right to annex any part of the Danish kingdom, which includes Greenland and two other nations. This marks a diplomatic pushback against US rhetoric on territorial interests in the Arctic region.</p>
<h2>South Korea-China Relations Meeting</h2>
<p>South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss key issues including trade, regional security, and Beijing’s ongoing unofficial ban on Korean pop culture. This meeting signals an effort by South Korea to reset and improve relations with China amid broader geopolitical tensions in East Asia.</p>
<h2>French University Training Spies</h2>
<p>Near Paris, Sciences Po Saint-Germain is a university dedicated to training French intelligence agents, both current and potential recruits. This institution plays a crucial role in preparing operatives for national security challenges, shedding light on France’s formal approach to maintaining effective intelligence capabilities.</p>
