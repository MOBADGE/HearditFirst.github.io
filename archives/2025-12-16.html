    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>Ukraine’s Energy Challenges Amid Russian Attacks</h2>
<p>Ukraine is struggling to maintain its electricity supply as Russian attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure intensify. Maxim Timchenko, head of the Ukrainian energy company DTEK, described the frequency and severity of the strikes as leaving "no time to recover" between hits. This ongoing pressure on Ukraine’s power systems threatens the stability of essential services and daily life, highlighting the widening impact of the conflict on civilian infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Bondi Beach Shooting and Heroic Response</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting at Bondi Beach in Australia has left two people dead, including a couple who bravely tried to stop one of the gunmen. Witnesses say Boris Gurman, 69, "charged straight towards the danger" and managed to grab one of the attacker’s guns before both he and his companion were killed. The shooter, Sajid Akram, originally from India, had limited contact with his family in Hyderabad, India, since moving to Australia 27 years ago.</p>
<p>The incident has drawn national attention, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visiting Gurman in hospital and calling him "a true Australian hero" with "a strong heart." Meanwhile, some witnesses criticized the police response, suggesting officers were too slow to disarm the gunmen. However, the New South Wales premier defended the police, stating they were “shot in the front” during the attack, implying they faced immediate danger.</p>
<h2>US Military Strikes on Alleged Drug Boats</h2>
<p>The US military has reported its latest operations targeting drug trafficking at sea, killing eight people in the most recent strike on alleged drug vessels. Since September, more than 20 such strikes have occurred in international waters. These actions aim to disrupt illicit drug movement but raise questions about the legal and strategic implications of military force on the high seas.</p>
<h2>Landmark Trial Ends With Conviction of Ex-Rebel Leader</h2>
<p>A French court sentenced Roger Lumbala, a former rebel and politician from the Democratic Republic of Congo, to 30 years in prison. The case was notable for being a landmark trial addressing atrocities committed during the Second Congo War. The conviction marks an important moment in international justice efforts related to wartime human rights abuses.</p>
<h2>Dinosaur Footprints Discovered in Italy</h2>
<p>Scientists have uncovered thousands of dinosaur footprints on an Italian mountain, dating back around 210 million years. The fossils include detailed impressions of toes and claws, providing valuable insights into the types of dinosaurs that lived in the area. This discovery adds to our understanding of prehistoric life in Europe and offers new opportunities for paleontological research.</p>
<h2>Entertainment News: Lizzo and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In other news, singer Lizzo has celebrated the dismissal of fat-shaming claims against her, which she said had "haunted" her. However, she continues to face separate allegations of sexual harassment, keeping her in the spotlight beyond her musical career.</p>
