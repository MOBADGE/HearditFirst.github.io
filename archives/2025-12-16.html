    <h2>Bondi Shooting and Heroic Intervention</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting incident took place in Bondi, Australia, where multiple victims lost their lives. Authorities have identified some of the victims as two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor, and a 10-year-old girl. During the attack, Boris Gurman, 69, was seen in dashcam footage attempting to stop one of the gunmen by grabbing a weapon from him. Gurman was later killed in the attack. The actions of Gurman and others on the scene demonstrated courage in the face of danger.</p>
<h2>Australian Prime Minister Praises Bondi Hero</h2>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Boris Gurman in the hospital, describing him as "a true Australian hero" and praising his bravery in the attack. Albanese acknowledged Gurman as "the best of our country" and offered support and recognition for his selfless actions during the violent event. This visit underscores the national impact of the Bondi shooting and the importance of honoring those who act with courage.</p>
<h2>Police Response to Bondi Shooting Under Scrutiny</h2>
<p>The New South Wales premier has responded to criticism about the police reaction during the Bondi shooting. Some witnesses felt the police were slow to disarm the two gunmen involved. However, the premier rejected these criticisms, stating that the police were "shot in the front," indicating they faced danger early in their response. The official stance defends the efforts and risks undertaken by law enforcement during the incident.</p>
<h2>Energy Challenges in Ukraine Amid Russian Attacks</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing ongoing difficulties in maintaining its electricity supply due to continuous attacks by Russian forces. Maxim Timchenko, head of the energy company DTEK, said the frequency and intensity of Russian strikes are so high that there is little time for recovery between attacks. This situation highlights the growing problems Ukraine faces in sustaining critical infrastructure during the conflict, affecting daily life and potentially international energy markets.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments: Former DR Congo Rebel Sentenced</h2>
<p>In France, Roger Lumbala, a former rebel and politician from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison. The sentence follows a landmark trial related to alleged atrocities committed during the Second Congo war. This conviction marks a significant moment in international justice efforts for war crimes and accountability for past conflicts.</p>
<h2>US Military Strikes Target Alleged Drug Vessels</h2>
<p>The US military has continued operations against drug trafficking at sea, carrying out more than 20 strikes on suspected drug boats in international waters since September. The latest strikes resulted in eight deaths. These actions are part of ongoing efforts to disrupt maritime drug trafficking, which remains a persistent challenge for international security and law enforcement agencies.</p>
