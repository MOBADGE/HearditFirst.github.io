    <h2>Bondi Beach Attack and Heroism</h2>
<p>Dashcam footage has revealed dramatic moments from the recent shooting at Bondi Beach, where a couple attempted to intervene during the attack. Boris Gurman, 69, confronted the gunman and managed to grab one of his weapons before both were killed. This act of bravery was highlighted by witnesses and has drawn public attention.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Gurman in hospital prior to his death, calling him "a true Australian hero" and praising his strong heart. Gurman’s actions, along with those of his partner, have been widely recognized as courageous attempts to stop the violence.</p>
<h2>Details on the Bondi Gunman</h2>
<p>Police identified the attacker as Sajid Akram, who originally came from India. He has lived in Australia for 27 years but reportedly maintained "limited" contact with his family in Hyderabad, India. This background information adds depth to the ongoing investigation into his motives and personal history.</p>
<p>Authorities continue to explore the circumstances surrounding the attack, seeking to understand what led to the tragic event.</p>
<h2>US Designates Colombian Cocaine Gang as Terrorists</h2>
<p>In the United States, the government has officially classified a Colombian cocaine trafficking gang as a terrorist organization. This designation marks an intensification of efforts to combat drug-related violence and trafficking in Latin America. It follows a broader strategy aimed at disrupting drug networks and reducing the flow of illegal substances into the US.</p>
<p>This move is part of the ongoing policies seen under the Trump administration, signaling continued prioritization of drug enforcement in the region.</p>
<h2>EU Revises Car Emissions Policy</h2>
<p>The European Union has recently moderated its plans to ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2035. This change comes after strong lobbying from automakers, especially in Germany, who sought concessions on the original rules. The adjustment reflects ongoing debates about the balance between environmental targets and industrial concerns.</p>
<p>This development may impact the pace at which electric vehicles become dominant in Europe and shapes the region’s future approach to reducing carbon emissions from transportation.</p>
<h2>Sudan Conflict and Allegations of Cover-Up</h2>
<p>Researchers from Yale University have reported efforts by Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to conceal mass killings in the city of el-Fasher. Satellite images indicate that bodies are being buried and burned as part of an alleged cover-up amid the ongoing conflict.</p>
<p>These findings add to international concerns about human rights abuses and complicate peace and accountability efforts in Sudan.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery: Dinosaur Footprints in Italy</h2>
<p>Scientists have uncovered thousands of dinosaur footprints on an Italian mountain, dating back approximately 210 million years. The prints include clear marks of toes and claws, offering valuable insights into the creatures that roamed the region long ago.</p>
<p>This discovery adds to the understanding of prehistoric life in Europe and may attract further paleontological interest and research in the area.</p>
