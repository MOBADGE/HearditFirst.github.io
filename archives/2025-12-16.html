    <h2>Ukraine’s Energy Under Strain from Russian Attacks</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing severe challenges in maintaining its electricity supply amid frequent Russian strikes. Maxim Timchenko, head of Ukraine’s major energy company DTEK, described the attacks as so intense and continuous that there is barely any time for repair and recovery. This ongoing situation threatens critical infrastructure and could have wider impacts on civilians and the country’s stability.</p>
<h2>Bondi Beach Shooting and Heroic Intervention</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting occurred at Bondi Beach, Australia, where a 69-year-old man, Boris Gurman, attempted to stop the gunman before being killed. Witnesses reported that Gurman “charged straight towards the danger” and seized one of the attacker’s guns in an effort to intervene. The gunman, Sajid Akram, originally from India, had limited contact with his family since relocating to Australia 27 years ago. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Gurman in the hospital, calling him “a true Australian hero” and praising his strength and courage.</p>
<h2>Changes in EU Car Emission Regulations</h2>
<p>The European Union has softened its initial plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. This change follows substantial lobbying from car manufacturers, particularly those in Germany, who sought concessions to the strict environmental rules. The adjustment reflects ongoing debates about balancing environmental goals with economic and industry concerns in the automotive sector.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Sudan</h2>
<p>Researchers from Yale University have reported efforts by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to hide evidence of mass killings in the city of el-Fasher. Satellite imagery shows that bodies are being buried and burned, suggesting a cover-up of serious human rights violations. These findings add to growing international concern about violence and abuses involving paramilitary groups in Sudan.</p>
<h2>US Military Strikes on Drug Vessels</h2>
<p>Since September, the US military has conducted over 20 strikes targeting alleged drug boats in international waters. The latest operations resulted in eight deaths, part of ongoing efforts to disrupt drug trafficking routes. These strikes underline the US commitment to combating illegal drug flow but also raise questions about maritime security and the impact of such operations.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery: Dinosaur Footprints in Italy</h2>
<p>On a lighter note, scientists have discovered thousands of dinosaur footprints on a mountain in Italy, dating back around 210 million years. The footprints include detailed traces of toes and claws, offering valuable insights into the prehistoric creatures that once roamed the area. This discovery contributes to the understanding of dinosaur behavior and environment during that period.</p>
