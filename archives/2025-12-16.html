    <h2>Ukraine’s Power Grid Under Strain from Russian Attacks</h2>
<p>Maxim Timchenko, head of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, reports that the frequent and intense Russian strikes on Ukraine’s power infrastructure are leaving little time for recovery. The ongoing attacks are causing significant disruptions to electricity supply, making it difficult for Ukraine to maintain stable energy for homes and businesses. This situation highlights the broader challenges faced by Ukraine amid the conflict, as critical infrastructure remains a prime target. Restoring and protecting the power grid will be vital for civilian life and economic stability moving forward.</p>
<h2>Bondi Beach Tragedy and Heroism</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting at Bondi Beach has drawn attention to the bravery of Boris Gurman, 69, who tried to intervene during the attack. Witnesses described how Gurman charged toward the gunman and attempted to disarm him. Unfortunately, Gurman and another individual were killed during the incident. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Gurman in hospital prior to his death, praising him as “a true Australian hero” and recognizing his courage. The gunman, Sajid Akram, originally from India, had limited connections with his family after moving to Australia 27 years ago, according to police.</p>
<h2>Europe Softens Emission Rules for Cars</h2>
<p>The European Union has eased its plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. Pressure from car manufacturers, especially in Germany, prompted concessions to the proposed rules. This shift is significant as the EU had been pushing for stringent environmental targets to combat climate change. The modified regulations may impact how quickly electric and other low-emission vehicles replace conventional cars across Europe, influencing both industry strategies and efforts to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<h2>Sudan’s RSF Accused of Covering Up Mass Killings</h2>
<p>Researchers from Yale University have reported evidence suggesting that Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are attempting to conceal mass killings in the city of el-Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the researchers show the paramilitary group burying and burning bodies. These alleged actions raise serious human rights concerns and add to the ongoing instability and violence within Sudan. The international community may seek further investigation and response as more information becomes available.</p>
<h2>New Dinosaur Footprints Discovered in Italy</h2>
<p>Paleontologists have uncovered thousands of dinosaur footprints on an Italian mountain, dating back approximately 210 million years. The footprints reveal preserved details such as toes and claws, providing valuable insights into early dinosaur movement and behavior. This discovery adds to the understanding of prehistoric life and the environment of that period. It also offers a new site for scientific study and potentially attracts interest for educational and tourism purposes in the region.</p>
<h2>US Military Strikes Target Alleged Drug Boats</h2>
<p>The US military has reportedly killed eight people in recent strikes on suspected drug vessels in international waters. Since September, more than 20 such strikes have been carried out. These operations are part of ongoing efforts to disrupt drug trafficking routes. The continued use of military force at sea underscores the challenges of combating illegal drug trade and the importance placed on maritime security and interdiction by the US.</p>
