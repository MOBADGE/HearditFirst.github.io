    <h2>Shootings in Australia and the US</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck in Bondi, Sydney, where a shooting resulted in 15 deaths, including a 10-year-old girl, two rabbis, and a Holocaust survivor. The community has been mourning, with crowds leaving flowers and candles to honor the victims. Some witnesses criticized the police response, suggesting officers were slow to disarm the two gunmen. However, the New South Wales premier defended the police, saying they were "shot in the front" by criticism and rejecting claims of delay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Rhode Island, a separate shooting at Brown University left two people dead and nine injured. Authorities have named two victims and are continuing the search for the gunman.</p>
<h2>US Drug Enforcement Operations at Sea</h2>
<p>The US military reported carrying out more than 20 strikes against alleged drug boats in international waters since September. In the latest operation, eight people were killed during these interventions targeting vessels suspected of drug trafficking. These ongoing efforts show the US continues to take aggressive measures to disrupt illegal drug shipments at sea.</p>
<h2>Political Dynamics in the United States</h2>
<p>Looking ahead to the next US presidential election, there are notable divisions within Donald Trump’s political coalition. Although the election is still some time away, sources report active jockeying among Trump’s supporters as they position themselves for potential leadership roles in the post-Trump era. This infighting highlights early challenges within the movement as it prepares for future political contests.</p>
