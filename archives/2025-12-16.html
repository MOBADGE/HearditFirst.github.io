    <h2>Australia Bondi Attack and Hero Recognition</h2>
<p>Dashcam footage has revealed the moments when Boris Gurman, 69, risked his life by charging toward an attacker during a violent incident in Bondi. Gurman reportedly grabbed one of the guns from the attacker before being killed. His actions, described by witnesses as brave and selfless, have drawn public and official attention. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Gurman in hospital, calling him “a true Australian hero” and praising his courage and resilience. This recognition highlights the impact of individual acts of bravery during crises.</p>
<h2>EU Modifies Plans on Petrol and Diesel Vehicle Sales</h2>
<p>The European Union has scaled back its initial ambition to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. This adjustment comes after strong lobbying from car manufacturers, with significant pressure from German companies. The change reflects ongoing negotiations balancing environmental goals with economic and industrial concerns. The revised rules may slow the pace of the EU’s transition to zero-emissions vehicles, affecting climate strategies and the future auto market in Europe.</p>
<h2>Sudan Conflict: Accusations of Cover-Up in el-Fasher</h2>
<p>Researchers from Yale University report that Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) appear to be covering up mass killings in the town of el-Fasher. Satellite images indicate that the RSF has been burying and burning bodies, an effort believed to conceal evidence of atrocities. The claims add to international concern over ongoing violence in Sudan, underscoring a complex humanitarian crisis. These findings may influence global responses and investigations into human rights abuses in the region.</p>
<h2>US Drug Policy Escalation with Colombian Gang Terrorist Designation</h2>
<p>The United States government has designated a major Colombian cocaine trafficking gang as a terrorist organization. This decision marks a heightened phase in the ongoing war on drugs in Latin America under the Trump administration. Additionally, the US military has reported killing eight people in strikes against alleged drug boats, with over 20 such operations conducted in international waters since September. These actions seek to disrupt drug trafficking networks but also raise questions about the broader impact on regional security and international law.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Legal News</h2>
<p>Dr Mark Chavez, one of five people who pleaded guilty in relation to the death of actor Matthew Perry, was sentenced to eight months of home detention. This sentencing is part of ongoing legal proceedings following the actor’s overdose death.</p>
<p>In other entertainment-related news, singer Lizzo celebrated after allegations of fat-shaming against her were dismissed. However, she continues to face separate accusations of sexual harassment. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of the late Hollywood director Rob Reiner, known for his activism and opposition to Trump’s policies.</p>
