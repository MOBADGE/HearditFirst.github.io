    <h2>Heroism During Bondi Attack</h2>
<p>Dashcam footage has revealed a couple’s courageous effort to stop a gunman during a recent attack in Bondi. Boris Gurman, 69, reportedly "charged straight towards the danger" and managed to seize one of the attacker’s guns before being killed, according to a witness. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, visited Gurman in hospital, describing him as "a true Australian hero" and praising his bravery and strong heart. This event has drawn national attention to the individuals risking their lives to protect others.</p>
<h2>Changes to EU Car Emission Rules</h2>
<p>The European Union has softened its previously strict plans to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. This move follows intense lobbying from carmakers, especially in Germany, who pushed for concessions to the original rules. The easing of these regulations could impact the EU’s climate goals by allowing more flexibility in the transition to electric vehicles. The final details on how these changes will be implemented and their long-term effects remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>Sudan Conflict and Attempted Cover-up</h2>
<p>Researchers from Yale University have reported that Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are attempting to conceal mass killings in the town of el-Fasher. Satellite images indicate the RSF is burying and burning bodies, actions seen as efforts to hide evidence of atrocities. This development highlights ongoing violence and human rights abuses linked to the conflict in Sudan. The international community may increase pressure for investigations and accountability as more evidence surfaces.</p>
<h2>US Military Strikes on Drug Vessels</h2>
<p>The US military has conducted more than 20 strikes on vessels suspected of carrying drugs in international waters since September, resulting in eight deaths during the latest attacks. These operations represent a continuation of the US government’s aggressive campaign against drug trafficking. Separately, the US has designated a Colombian cocaine gang as a terrorist organization, marking an intensification of efforts to combat drug-related crime in Latin America. These actions may intensify diplomatic and security cooperation in the region.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Legal Updates</h2>
<p>In the entertainment world, Dr Mark Chavez was sentenced to eight months of home detention after pleading guilty in connection to actor Matthew Perry’s overdose death. Meanwhile, singer Lizzo publicly addressed and celebrated the dismissal of fat-shaming claims that she said "haunted" her, though she is still facing sexual harassment allegations. Additionally, former US president Donald Trump renewed his criticism of late Hollywood director Rob Reiner, a known liberal activist and critic of Trump, continuing a longstanding public feud.</p>
<h2>Paleontology Discovery in Italy</h2>
<p>A remarkable discovery in Italy has revealed thousands of dinosaur footprints on a mountain, estimated to be around 210 million years old. The footprints include detailed traces of toes and claws, providing valuable insights into prehistoric life. This finding offers a significant opportunity for scientists to better understand the movement and behavior of dinosaurs during that era. Further exploration and study are expected to follow as researchers analyze the site.</p>
