    <h2>Ukraine’s Power Struggles Amid Ongoing Attacks</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing severe challenges in maintaining its energy supplies as Russian attacks intensify. Maxim Timchenko, head of Ukrainian energy firm DTEK, described the frequency of strikes as relentless, leaving no time for the country's infrastructure to recover. This sustained pressure risks widespread power outages as the winter season progresses, complicating daily life and efforts to rebuild.</p>
<h2>Bondi Beach Shooting: Acts of Courage and Investigation</h2>
<p>A tragic shooting at Bondi Beach has drawn attention to the bravery of Boris Gurman, a 69-year-old who tried to stop the gunman by grabbing one of the attacker’s weapons before both were killed. Police have identified the gunman as Sajid Akram, originally from India, who had limited contact with his family in Hyderabad after moving to Australia 27 years ago. The New South Wales premier has rejected criticism over the police response time to the incident, despite some witnesses suggesting delays in disarming the attackers. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Gurman in hospital, calling him a "true Australian hero" with a "strong heart."</p>
<h2>US Military Continues Strikes on Alleged Drug Smuggling Vessels</h2>
<p>The US military has reported killing eight people in recent strikes against ships suspected of drug smuggling in international waters. Since September, more than 20 such strikes have been conducted as part of ongoing efforts to disrupt drug trafficking at sea. The attacks highlight the ongoing US commitment to combating illicit drug operations beyond its borders.</p>
<h2>Landmark Conviction of Former Rebel Leader in France</h2>
<p>Roger Lumbala, a former rebel and politician from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison by a French court. This ruling is part of a landmark international trial addressing atrocities committed during the Second Congo War. The sentence underscores increasing global efforts to hold individuals accountable for war crimes and human rights violations.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery: Ancient Dinosaur Footprints in Italy</h2>
<p>Scientists have uncovered thousands of dinosaur footprints on an Italian mountain, dating back approximately 210 million years. The fossils show detailed traces of toes and claws, providing valuable insights into prehistoric life and the environment during that era. This discovery adds to the global understanding of dinosaur behavior and habitat.</p>
<h2>Entertainment News: Lizzo Cleared of Fat-Shaming Allegations</h2>
<p>Musician Lizzo has celebrated the dismissal of claims accusing her of fat-shaming, which she described as a persistent source of distress. However, she continues to face separate allegations related to sexual harassment. The developments reflect ongoing conversations about accountability and personal conduct within the entertainment industry.</p>
