    <h2>Ukraine’s Energy Struggles Amid Frequent Russian Attacks</h2>
<p>Ukraine is facing severe challenges in maintaining its electricity supply due to repeated Russian strikes on its energy infrastructure. Maxim Timchenko, head of energy company DTEK, highlighted that the frequency and intensity of attacks leave little time for repair and recovery between incidents. The ongoing damage threatens the country’s power stability as winter continues, potentially impacting civilians and industry.</p>
<h2>Bondi Shooting: Heroic Actions and Official Responses</h2>
<p>In Bondi, Australia, a tragic shooting left multiple fatalities, including a couple who tried to intervene. Boris Gurman, 69, attempted to disarm one of the attackers and grabbed a gun, according to witness accounts, before being killed. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Gurman in hospital, praising him as “a true Australian hero” and recognizing his courage. Meanwhile, the New South Wales premier faced criticism over police response times during the attack but rejected claims that officers were too slow to act.</p>
<h2>US Military Strikes Target Suspected Drug Vessels</h2>
<p>The US military reported conducting over 20 strikes on vessels suspected of carrying drugs in international waters since September. Recent actions resulted in eight deaths during attacks on boats alleged to be involved in drug trafficking. These ongoing operations reflect efforts to curb illegal drug shipments, though specific future plans or impacts were not detailed.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in International Justice</h2>
<p>In France, Roger Lumbala, a former rebel and political figure from the Democratic Republic of Congo, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in a landmark case. He was convicted in connection with atrocities committed during the Second Congo War. This ruling marks a significant moment for international accountability related to the conflict.</p>
<h2>Tragic Deaths in Hollywood and Related Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>The director Rob Reiner and his wife were found dead in their home, and their son Nick has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Rob Reiner was known as a longtime Democrat and vocal critic of former US President Donald Trump, who reiterated criticism even after Reiner’s death. The case remains under investigation as details unfold.</p>
<h2>Sudan Accused of Covering Up Mass Killings</h2>
<p>Researchers from Yale University have accused Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of attempting to conceal mass killings in el-Fasher. Satellite imagery reportedly shows the RSF burying and burning bodies to hide evidence. The situation points to serious human rights concerns amid ongoing instability in Sudan.</p>
