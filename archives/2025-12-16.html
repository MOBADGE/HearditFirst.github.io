    <h2>Ukraine Faces Power Challenges Amid Russian Strikes</h2>
<p>Ukraine is struggling to maintain its electricity supply due to frequent Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Maxim Timchenko, head of the Ukrainian energy company DTEK, described the strikes as so intense and constant that repair teams have little or no time to recover between attacks. This ongoing pressure threatens the country’s ability to keep essential services powered and may affect civilians especially during the winter months.</p>
<h2>Bondi Beach Shooting: Heroes and Investigation</h2>
<p>In Australia, a tragic shooting incident took place near Bondi Beach. Dashcam footage revealed a couple attempting to stop the gunman before both were killed. Boris Gurman, a 69-year-old man, "charged straight towards the danger" and managed to grab one of the attacker’s guns, according to a witness. The gunman, identified by police as Sajid Akram, originally came from India and had limited contact with his family since moving to Australia 27 years ago.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Boris Gurman in hospital, praising him as "a true Australian hero" and acknowledging the courage shown. Meanwhile, New South Wales Premier rejected criticism of the police response to the attack, despite some witnesses suggesting the police were too slow to disarm the shooters.</p>
<h2>US Military Conducts Strikes on Alleged Drug Vessels</h2>
<p>The US military has targeted suspected drug trafficking operations at sea, killing eight people in the latest of more than 20 strikes on alleged drug boats in international waters since September. These operations reflect ongoing efforts by the US to combat illegal drug shipments that could have broad regional impacts.</p>
<h2>Landmark Conviction for Former Congolese Rebel Leader</h2>
<p>In a significant legal development, a French court sentenced Roger Lumbala, a former rebel and politician from the Democratic Republic of Congo, to 30 years in prison. He was convicted in connection with war crimes committed during the Second Congo war. This trial marks an important step in international efforts to hold individuals accountable for atrocities committed during conflict.</p>
<h2>Cultural News: Lizzo and Dinosaur Discoveries</h2>
<p>Pop star Lizzo expressed relief after being cleared of fat-shaming allegations, which she said had “haunted” her. However, she continues to face separate accusations of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>In a scientific discovery, thousands of dinosaur footprints estimated to be about 210 million years old were found on a mountain in Italy. The prints show clear details of toes and claws, providing new insights into the prehistoric lives of these ancient creatures.</p>
