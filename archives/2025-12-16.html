    <h2>Bondi Attack and Heroic Intervention</h2>
<p>Dashcam footage has emerged showing a couple attempting to stop a gunman during a deadly attack in Bondi. Boris Gurman, 69, reportedly charged towards the attacker and managed to grab one of the assailant's guns before being killed. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Gurman in hospital, calling him "a true Australian hero" and praising his bravery. This incident highlights both the dangers of sudden violence and the courage some individuals show in trying to protect others.</p>
<h2>Murder Charges Filed in Reiner Case</h2>
<p>Nick Reiner has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in connection to the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner. The charges also include allegations of using a deadly weapon. This case is a tragic development involving the death of the couple and could lead to a significant court process as the legal system addresses these serious accusations.</p>
<h2>US Designates Colombian Cocaine Gang as Terrorists</h2>
<p>The US government has officially designated a Colombian cocaine trafficking gang as a terrorist group. This action is part of what is described as an escalation of efforts against drug cartels in Latin America. Labeling the gang in this way may allow for more aggressive legal and military measures and could impact the ongoing efforts to combat drug-related violence and trafficking in the region.</p>
<h2>EU Modifies Plans to End New Petrol and Diesel Car Sales by 2035</h2>
<p>The European Union has softened its proposed regulations aimed at ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. Heavy lobbying from car manufacturers, especially in Germany, led to concessions in the original plan. This change could affect the EU’s broader climate goals and the automotive industry’s transition to electric vehicles, delaying a full shift away from traditional combustion engines.</p>
<h2>Sudan RSF Accused of Covering Up Mass Killings</h2>
<p>Yale University researchers report that Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are attempting to conceal mass killings in the city of el-Fasher. Satellite images reportedly show efforts to bury and burn bodies, suggesting a cover-up of atrocities. This raises serious concerns about human rights abuses in Sudan and poses challenges for international investigations and accountability.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery of Dinosaur Footprints in Italy</h2>
<p>Thousands of dinosaur footprints have been found on a mountain in Italy, dating back approximately 210 million years. The footprints display clear marks from toes and claws, providing valuable insight into prehistoric life in the region. This discovery contributes to our understanding of dinosaurs’ behavior and movement during the Triassic period.</p>
