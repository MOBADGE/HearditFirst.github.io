    <h2>Heroism in Bondi Attack</h2>
<p>Dashcam footage has emerged showing the moment Boris Gurman, 69, a bystander, confronted a gunman during an attack in Bondi. According to a witness, Gurman “charged straight towards the danger” and managed to grab one of the attacker’s guns. Unfortunately, Gurman and his partner were killed in the incident. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Gurman in hospital prior to his death, praising him as “a true Australian hero” with a strong heart. This act of bravery has drawn national attention and highlights the risks civilians sometimes take in the face of violence.</p>
<h2>US Designates Colombian Cocaine Gang as Terrorists</h2>
<p>The United States government has officially designated a Colombian cocaine trafficking organization as a terrorist group. This designation marks a notable escalation in the ongoing U.S. efforts to combat drug trafficking from Latin America. It reflects a continuation of the approach associated with the Trump administration’s war on drugs, aiming to strengthen legal and military measures against powerful criminal networks in the region.</p>
<h2>EU Revises Ban on Petrol and Diesel Cars</h2>
<p>The European Union has scaled back its original plans to end sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. Heavy lobbying, particularly from car manufacturers in Germany, influenced the decision to soften some of the proposed rules. This adjustment may affect the timeline and stringency of Europe’s transition to electric vehicles and efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the transportation sector.</p>
<h2>Sudan’s RSF Accused of Covering Up Mass Killings</h2>
<p>Researchers from Yale University have reported that Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are attempting to conceal evidence of mass killings in el-Fasher. Satellite images indicate the RSF is burying and burning bodies at the site. This development raises concerns about human rights abuses amid ongoing conflicts in Sudan and the challenges in documenting atrocities when access on the ground is limited.</p>
<h2>US Military Continues Strikes on Drug Trafficking Vessels</h2>
<p>The US military announced it has conducted more than 20 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in international waters since September, resulting in eight deaths in the latest operations. These actions represent an ongoing effort to interrupt the flow of narcotics by targeting maritime routes used by drug cartels. These strikes tie into broader US strategies to combat drug trafficking on multiple fronts.</p>
<h2>New Dinosaur Footprint Discovery in Italy</h2>
<p>Scientists have uncovered thousands of dinosaur footprints on an Italian mountain, dating back approximately 210 million years. The prints include detailed impressions of toes and claws, offering valuable insights into prehistoric life and dinosaur movement. This discovery adds significant information to paleontological studies and helps deepen the understanding of dinosaurs’ behavior and habitat during the Triassic period.</p>
