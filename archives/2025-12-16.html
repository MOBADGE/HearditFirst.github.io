    <h2>Bondi Attack and Heroic Intervention</h2>
<p>A dashcam video has revealed moments from a recent violent attack in Bondi, Australia, where Boris Gurman, 69, confronted the gunman. Witnesses said Gurman "charged straight towards the danger" and managed to grab one of the attacker’s guns before he and his partner were killed. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, visited Gurman in hospital, describing him as "a true Australian hero" with a "strong heart." This tragic event has drawn national attention to acts of bravery in crisis situations.</p>
<h2>European Union Adjusts Car Emission Rules</h2>
<p>The European Union has softened its plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. This change comes after intense lobbying by car manufacturers, especially from Germany. The original plan aimed to aggressively phase out fossil-fuel vehicles to reduce emissions and combat climate change. By adjusting these rules, the EU is balancing environmental goals with the automotive industry's concerns, potentially affecting the pace at which electric vehicles become dominant in Europe.</p>
<h2>Sudan Conflict and Allegations of Cover-Up</h2>
<p>Researchers from Yale University have reported evidence that Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are attempting to hide mass killings in el-Fasher. Satellite images show the paramilitary group burying and burning bodies, suggesting efforts to cover up crimes amid ongoing conflict in the region. These findings add to concerns about human rights abuses in Sudan and complicate international efforts to address the violence.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in Matthew Perry’s Death</h2>
<p>Dr Mark Chavez has been sentenced to eight months of home detention following his guilty plea in the investigation into actor Matthew Perry’s overdose death. Five people have pleaded guilty in connection with the case. This sentencing marks a significant step in the legal proceedings around Perry’s death, highlighting ongoing scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding the overdose.</p>
<h2>Scientific Discovery: Dinosaur Footprints in Italy</h2>
<p>Thousands of dinosaur footprints have been discovered on a mountain in Italy, dating back around 210 million years. The prints include detailed traces of toes and claws, offering valuable insights into dinosaur behavior and movement during the Triassic period. This find is important for paleontology, enriching the understanding of prehistoric life in Europe and providing a rare glimpse into the distant past.</p>
<h2>US Actions on Latin American Drug Trafficking</h2>
<p>The US government has designated a Colombian cocaine trafficking gang as a terrorist organization, intensifying its campaign against drug trafficking in Latin America. Additionally, US military sources reported that eight people were killed in recent strikes on suspected drug vessels in international waters. Since September, over 20 such strikes have been carried out. These measures represent a growing US effort to disrupt drug operations and address international narcotics challenges.</p>
