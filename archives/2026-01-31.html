    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 31, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Newly released documents connected to Jeffrey Epstein have brought fresh attention to well-known figures, including hundreds of mentions of Donald Trump and communications involving a figure known as “The Duke.” These three million documents provide a large amount of information, but much remains to be understood about their full implications.</p>
<p>In Israel, some members of parliament are pushing for legislation to introduce the death penalty specifically for Palestinian attackers. The proposal is highly controversial and has sparked debate within the country. The move aims to address security concerns but raises questions about the use of capital punishment in the region.</p>
<h2>United States News</h2>
<p>The US government is partially shut down after Congress failed to pass a funding deal in time. A stopgap agreement was reached, but the House of Representatives will not be able to vote on approving the deal until Monday. Until then, government operations remain affected, causing uncertainty and delays in federal services.</p>
<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon has been charged for his involvement in protests against immigration enforcement (ICE) at a church in Minnesota. Lemon states that he was doing his job by reporting on the events, highlighting the tensions surrounding immigration issues and the role of journalists covering protests.</p>
<h2>Canada Politics</h2>
<p>Pierre Poilievre has been re-elected as leader of Canada’s Conservative Party, securing a strong 87.4% of the delegate vote. Despite recent losses to the Liberal Party in national elections, Poilievre’s re-election shows continued support within his party as it positions itself for future political challenges.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Culture</h2>
<p>The world mourns the loss of Canadian comedic actress Catherine O’Hara, who died at age 71 after a brief illness. Tributes have poured in from fellow actors including Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, honoring her influential career and impact on comedy and film.</p>
<p>A new documentary called *Melania*, directed by Brett Ratner, has been released, offering a brief look at the life of Melania Trump. The film provides some personal insights but leaves many questions unanswered about the former first lady’s private experiences.</p>
<h2>Global Humanitarian Concerns</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, harsh winter conditions pose a severe threat to civilians already coping with electricity cuts despite a recent energy truce. Temperatures are expected to drop to -20°C, intensifying fears of a humanitarian crisis as people struggle to stay warm in homes with limited power.</p>
<h2>Environment and Wildlife</h2>
<p>A coyote that swam to Alcatraz Island, the site of the famous former federal prison, is surviving by feeding on birds. Wildlife officials are monitoring the situation to determine whether the animal will stay or leave the isolated location, providing an unusual example of animal adaptation to urban environments.</p>
