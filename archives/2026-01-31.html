    <h2>Politics and Government</h2>
<p>The United States is experiencing a partial government shutdown despite a last-minute funding agreement. The deal cannot be fully approved until the US House of Representatives votes on it, which is expected no earlier than Monday. This delay means many government services remain affected for now.</p>
<p>In Canada, Pierre Poilievre has been re-elected leader of the Conservative Party, securing 87.4% of the delegates' votes. Poilievre remains the opposition leader despite recent losses to the Liberals in federal elections.</p>
<p>In Israel, a debate is ongoing about introducing the death penalty for Palestinian attackers. Some members of parliament support this highly controversial measure, describing it as a potential “vaccine against murder,” but the proposal is dividing the country.</p>
<h2>International Affairs and Security</h2>
<p>In Uganda, the president’s son has gained attention for his outspoken and sometimes violent rhetoric on social media. Known for threatening an opposition leader and making unusual claims about his ancestry, he has political ambitions to succeed his father.</p>
<p>Ukraine faces harsh conditions as temperatures are expected to drop to -20°C. Despite a temporary energy truce, electricity cuts persist, making it difficult for civilians to keep warm during the severe cold, raising concerns about a humanitarian crisis.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues</h2>
<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon has been charged following his involvement in a protest against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a Minnesota church. Lemon stated that he was acting as a journalist covering the event rather than participating in the protest itself.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>Tributes are pouring in for Canadian actress Catherine O'Hara, who passed away at age 71 after a brief illness. Known for her work in comedy, she was remembered by fellow actors including Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep.</p>
<p>A new documentary titled *Melania*, directed by Brett Ratner, offers a brief look into the life of Melania Trump. The film gives viewers a glimpse of the former first lady but leaves many questions unanswered about her personal story.</p>
<h2>Environment and Wildlife</h2>
<p>An unusual situation has developed on Alcatraz Island, where a coyote that swam to the isolated prison island is surviving by hunting birds. Authorities are considering what steps to take regarding whether the animal should stay or be removed from the island.</p>
