    <h2>International Conflict and Violence</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes have killed at least 32 Palestinians in Gaza during an ongoing ceasefire that both Israel and Hamas accuse each other of violating. The Israeli military confirmed responsibility for the strikes, continuing a cycle of hostilities in the region. In related developments, analysts say Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is pushing for stronger US military actions against Iran, hoping for regime change. This strategy reportedly involves reliance on former US President Donald Trump’s support.</p>
<p>In Iran, separate gas explosions on Saturday have resulted in five deaths, including a four-year-old child. Officials have not disclosed further details on the causes of the blasts.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>A mine collapse in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed more than 200 people. According to a local rebel spokesman, the mine gave way after heavy rains on Wednesday, causing a significant loss of life. This incident highlights ongoing safety challenges in the mining sector in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>A US federal judge has denied a request to block an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) surge in Minnesota. The judge acknowledged the potential for "heartbreaking" effects on communities but found that the state had not sufficiently proven its case against the ICE activities. Meanwhile, the US government is experiencing a partial shutdown despite a last-minute funding deal. The shutdown will continue at least until Monday, when the House of Representatives can vote on the funding package.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business</h2>
<p>SpaceX, the aerospace company founded by Elon Musk, has applied for permission to launch one million satellites into orbit. The company aims to build a network of "orbital data centres" that would support artificial intelligence technologies. This ambitious project could significantly expand satellite infrastructure but also raises questions about space traffic and debris.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Tributes are pouring in for Canadian actress Catherine O'Hara, who died in Los Angeles at the age of 71 following a brief illness. Known for her comedic roles, O’Hara was remembered by fellow actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep among others. Her passing marks the loss of a beloved figure in film and television.</p>
<h2>Additional News</h2>
<p>Millions of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein’s case have been released, including hundreds of mentions of Donald Trump and emails involving someone referred to as "The Duke." The files add new layers to ongoing investigations and public interest in Epstein’s network.</p>
<p>In Japan, the Pokémon franchise has canceled an event at a controversial shrine after criticism from China. The shrine is associated with a military memorial, and the backlash highlights sensitivities around historical and political symbolism in cultural events.</p>
