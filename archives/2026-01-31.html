    <h2>Global News: Violence and Conflict in the Middle East</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes in Gaza have killed at least 32 Palestinians, according to rescue officials. The strikes were confirmed by Israel's military and occurred amid a ceasefire that both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating. Meanwhile, in the broader region, reports suggest that Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu is pushing the United States towards more aggressive action against Iran, with hopes of inducing a regime change. Analysts note that Israel is relying on former US President Trump to support these maximalist strikes. These developments highlight ongoing tensions and the fragile nature of peace efforts in the region.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>Several tragic incidents have occurred around the world this week. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, over 200 people were killed when a mine collapsed following heavy rains. A local rebel spokesman provided details of the accident. Additionally, in Iran, five people died and 14 were injured due to separate gas explosions reported on Saturday. These events underscore continuing safety challenges in mining and infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>A federal judge has denied a request to block an increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minnesota. Though the judge acknowledged the potential "heartbreaking" effects of these actions, the state did not sufficiently support its case to stop the surge. On a related political note, despite a last-minute funding deal in the US Congress, the government has experienced a partial shutdown. The US House of Representatives will not vote to end the shutdown until Monday at the earliest, prolonging some interruptions in government services.</p>
<h2>Cultural News: Remembering Catherine O’Hara</h2>
<p>The entertainment world is mourning the loss of Catherine O’Hara, the Canadian comedic actress who died in Los Angeles at the age of 71 after a brief illness. Tributes have come from notable figures including Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, celebrating her contributions to film and comedy. O’Hara’s career and unique style left a significant mark on audiences and colleagues alike.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business: SpaceX Plans for AI Infrastructure</h2>
<p>SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, has applied for permission to launch up to one million satellites into orbit. The company aims to create a network of "orbital data centres" designed to support artificial intelligence applications. If approved and implemented, this project could significantly expand global data infrastructure and influence the future of AI technology deployment.</p>
<h2>International Controversies</h2>
<p>In Japan, the Pokémon company canceled an event that was to be held at a controversial military memorial shrine. The cancellation followed backlash, particularly from China, criticizing the choice of venue due to its sensitive historical associations. This move reflects ongoing regional sensitivities around memorial sites linked to military history.</p>
