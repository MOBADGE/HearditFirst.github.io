    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 31, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Politics</h2>
<p>New documents released from the Jeffrey Epstein case include over three million files. Among these are hundreds of mentions of Donald Trump and emails exchanged with someone identified as "The Duke." The extensive records may provide further insight into Epstein's network and associations.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, reports indicate that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is encouraging strong, maximalist actions from the United States aimed at regime change in Iran. Some analysts suggest Israel is relying on Donald Trump to support such measures, signaling heightened tensions and the potential for escalated conflict in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, within Israel, there is debate over a proposal to reinstate the death penalty specifically for Palestinian attackers following deadly incidents. This proposal is highly controversial and highlights divisions in Israeli politics over security and justice policies.</p>
<h2>United States Government and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>The US federal government is experiencing a partial shutdown despite the passage of a last-minute funding deal. Due to congressional scheduling, the House of Representatives cannot vote on the funding package to formally end the shutdown until Monday. This delay means that some government operations remain affected over the weekend.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, a federal judge has denied a request to block an increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation. Although the judge acknowledged that the surge in ICE activity could produce "heartbreaking" consequences in communities, the state government did not present sufficient legal grounds to halt the enforcement efforts.</p>
<h2>Canadian Politics</h2>
<p>In Canada, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre has solidified his position by winning a leadership confidence vote with 87.4% support from party delegates. This strong endorsement comes despite the Conservative Party's recent defeat in the national election to the Liberal Party, suggesting Poilievre maintains firm control over his party's direction.</p>
<h2>Business and Technology</h2>
<p>SpaceX, the aerospace company led by Elon Musk, has applied for permission to launch up to one million satellites into Earth's orbit. The initiative aims to create a network of "orbital data centres" designed to support the infrastructure of artificial intelligence. If approved, this massive satellite constellation could significantly impact communications and space-based computing capabilities.</p>
<h2>Cultural News</h2>
<p>The entertainment world is mourning the death of Catherine O'Hara, a Canadian comedic actress who passed away in Los Angeles at age 71 after a brief illness. Tributes have poured in from actors including Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, recognizing her influential contributions to comedy and film.</p>
<p>In Japan, the popular game Pokémon canceled a planned event at a controversial shrine following backlash. The shrine is a military memorial that attracted criticism, particularly from China, over the event's location. This cancellation reflects ongoing sensitivities around historical memory and international relations in the region.</p>
<h2>Notable Personalities</h2>
<p>In Uganda, the president’s son, known for his provocative statements on social media, has expressed ambitions to succeed his father. He is also noted for inflammatory remarks, including threats against a political opponent and unusual claims about his ancestry. His rise continues to draw attention within Ugandan and regional politics.</p>
