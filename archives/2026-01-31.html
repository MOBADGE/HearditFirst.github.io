    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 31, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in the Middle East as Israel appears to be pushing for significant changes in Iran. Analysts report that Prime Minister Netanyahu is urging the United States toward more aggressive military actions against Iran, hoping to influence regime change. Meanwhile, Israel is facing internal debate over a proposed law that would reintroduce the death penalty for Palestinians involved in deadly attacks, a move that has sparked serious controversy among Israeli lawmakers.</p>
<p>In the United States, the government is experiencing a partial shutdown despite a last-minute funding agreement. The funding deal cannot be fully approved until the House of Representatives votes on Monday, meaning some government operations remain closed for now.</p>
<h2>Developments in North America</h2>
<p>In Canada, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre has retained strong support within his party, securing 87.4% approval from delegates in a leadership test. This outcome strengthens his position as opposition leader, even after his recent electoral defeat to the Liberals.</p>
<p>In legal news, a federal judge in Minnesota has denied a request to block increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the state. While acknowledging that such enforcement could have "heartbreaking" consequences, the judge ruled that the state had not provided sufficient evidence to justify an injunction.</p>
<h2>Science and Technology</h2>
<p>SpaceX, the aerospace company founded by Elon Musk, has filed an application to launch one million satellites into orbit. The plan is to build a vast network of "orbital data centres" intended to support the development and operation of artificial intelligence technologies. This proposal, if approved and implemented, would significantly expand the number of satellites in low Earth orbit.</p>
<h2>Public Safety</h2>
<p>Iran suffered a tragic series of gas explosions on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of five people and injuries to fourteen others. The blasts were reported as separate incidents, highlighting ongoing safety concerns related to gas infrastructure in the country.</p>
<h2>Culture and Events</h2>
<p>The entertainment world mourns the loss of Catherine O'Hara, the Canadian comedic actress who passed away in Los Angeles at the age of 71 after a brief illness. Tributes poured in from fellow actors, including Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, recognizing her impact on comedy and film.</p>
<p>In Japan, the popular game franchise Pokémon canceled a planned event after facing backlash for choosing a controversial military memorial shrine as the venue. The decision came after criticism, particularly from China, drawing attention to the sensitive historical and political implications of the location.</p>
