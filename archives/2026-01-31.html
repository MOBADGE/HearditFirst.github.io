    <h2>Global Politics and Conflict</h2>
<p>Israeli military air strikes have killed at least 28 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local rescue officials. The strikes occurred despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with both sides accusing each other of violating the truce. Meanwhile, in Israel, a political debate is underway as some members of parliament propose reinstating the death penalty for Palestinians who carry out deadly attacks. This move has sparked controversy within the country and could impact future security policies and relations with Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>In Uganda, attention is focused on a prominent military chief known for making provocative statements on social media. The figure, who is also the son of the country's president, has declared grand ambitions to succeed his father while making controversial remarks that have attracted international notice.</p>
<h2>United States Government and Politics</h2>
<p>The US government has entered a partial shutdown following a last-minute funding deal. The shutdown continues because the US House of Representatives cannot vote on the funding agreement until Monday at the earliest. This temporary lapse in funding affects federal operations and highlights ongoing political challenges in reaching budget agreements.</p>
<p>A new documentary on Melania offers a brief insight into the life of the former first lady. Directed by Brett Ratner, the film provides limited new information but contributes to public understanding of her personal and public experiences.</p>
<h2>Canada and Political Leadership</h2>
<p>In Canada, Pierre Poilievre won strong support within his Conservative party, securing 87.4% of the vote in a leadership test. Poilievre is the opposition leader, and his significant backing comes despite the party's recent defeat to the Liberals in the national elections. This strong endorsement may influence the party’s direction and strategies ahead of future elections.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Accidents</h2>
<p>A tragic accident occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where over 200 people were killed after a mine collapsed. The collapse happened following heavy rains on Wednesday, as reported by a local rebel spokesman. This event is part of a long-standing issue with mining safety in the region and will likely prompt calls for improved safety measures.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>The entertainment world mourns the loss of Canadian comedic actress Catherine O’Hara, who died in Los Angeles at age 71 after a brief illness. Tributes to her work have been led by actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep among others, recognizing her contributions to comedy and film.</p>
<p>In Japan, the Pokémon Company canceled an event planned near a controversial military memorial shrine following backlash, particularly from China. The event, initially advertised through official channels, drew criticism for its association with the site, reflecting ongoing sensitivities about historical memory and international relations in the region.</p>
<h2>New Revelations</h2>
<p>A large batch of over three million documents connected to Jeffrey Epstein has been released. Among the files are hundreds of mentions of Donald Trump and emails between Epstein and an individual referred to as "The Duke". These documents offer new material for ongoing investigations and public scrutiny related to Epstein’s network and activities.</p>
