    <h2>International Conflicts and Security</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes in Gaza have killed at least 28 Palestinians, according to rescue officials. The Israeli military has confirmed carrying out these strikes during a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with both sides accusing each other of violations. Meanwhile, there is political debate in Israel over proposals to reinstate the death penalty for Palestinians involved in deadly attacks, a move that has sparked controversy among Israeli lawmakers.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Canada, Pierre Poilievre secured a decisive victory in the Conservative Party leadership test, winning 87.4% of the vote from party delegates. This strong endorsement comes despite the party's recent defeat in a federal election against the Liberal Party. In Uganda, the president’s son, known for making inflammatory statements on social media, has made public threats against opposition figures and has shown ambitions to succeed his father, raising concerns about political stability in the region.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Disasters</h2>
<p>A tragic mine collapse in the Democratic Republic of Congo resulted in the deaths of more than 200 people. The collapse occurred following heavy rains and highlights ongoing safety challenges in the mining sector. Rescue and recovery efforts are presumably underway amid difficult conditions.</p>
<h2>Science and Technology</h2>
<p>SpaceX has applied for permission to launch up to one million satellites into orbit. The company plans to create a network of what they call “orbital data centres,” intended to support advancing artificial intelligence technologies. This ambitious project could significantly expand satellite infrastructure but also raises questions about space traffic management and environmental impacts.</p>
<h2>Cultural News</h2>
<p>Canada and the entertainment world are mourning the loss of Catherine O'Hara, a beloved Canadian comedic actress who died in Los Angeles at age 71 after a brief illness. Tributes have been led by well-known actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, celebrating her contributions to film and comedy. In Japan, the Pokémon franchise cancelled a planned event at a controversial shrine due to backlash, particularly from China, over the shrine’s association with a military memorial. The cancellation reflects ongoing sensitivities related to historical memory and cultural events.</p>
<h2>Legal and Governmental Affairs in the US</h2>
<p>The United States government entered a partial shutdown due to delays in approving a new funding deal. Although a last-minute agreement was reached, the earliest the House of Representatives can vote to end the shutdown is on Monday. This interim shutdown affects some government operations and signals ongoing challenges in congressional budget negotiations.</p>
