    <h2>International Conflicts and Developments</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in the Middle East as Israeli air strikes killed at least 32 Palestinians in Gaza, according to rescue officials. The strikes occurred during a ceasefire period that both Israel and Hamas accuse each other of violating. Meanwhile, within Israel, political divisions have emerged over proposals to reinstate the death penalty specifically for attacks carried out by Palestinians. This move is highly controversial and reflects the ongoing security concerns within the country.</p>
<p>Adding to regional tensions, reports suggest that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is urging the United States to consider maximum-impact military strikes against Iran. Analysts view this as part of Israel’s broader strategic efforts aimed at regime change in Iran. Netanyahu’s approach appears to depend in part on the involvement or influence of Donald Trump.</p>
<h2>United States Political Update</h2>
<p>The U.S. government experienced a partial shutdown recently, despite a late attempt to pass a funding deal. The House of Representatives will not have the opportunity to vote on the deal until Monday, prolonging uncertainty about government operations. This disruption could affect various federal services and programs until funding is fully approved.</p>
<h2>Tragic Mining Accident in DR Congo</h2>
<p>More than 200 people have died after a mine collapsed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The accident happened following heavy rains, according to a local rebel spokesman. Such incidents highlight ongoing challenges in mining safety and infrastructure in the region, often impacting vulnerable communities involved in informal or artisanal mining.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Technology News</h2>
<p>SpaceX has announced plans to launch a vast constellation of one million satellites into orbit. The company aims to build a network of “orbital data centres” that would support artificial intelligence technologies. This initiative could significantly expand global connectivity and computing capabilities, but it also raises questions about space traffic management and environmental impact.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Tributes have poured in for Canadian comedic actress Catherine O’Hara, who died in Los Angeles at the age of 71 after a brief illness. Actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep were among those honoring her contributions to film and television. O’Hara was widely celebrated for her distinctive humor and memorable roles during her career.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pokémon franchise canceled an event planned at a controversial shrine in Japan following criticism from China. The site is a military memorial, and the backlash led Pokémon to withdraw from the location to avoid diplomatic tension.</p>
<h2>Canada’s Political Scene</h2>
<p>In Canadian politics, Pierre Poilievre secured a resounding victory in a Conservative party leadership test, earning 87.4% of delegate support. This strong endorsement came despite the party’s recent loss in the general election to the Liberals. Poilievre’s leadership is poised to shape the party’s direction moving forward as it seeks to regain public support.</p>
