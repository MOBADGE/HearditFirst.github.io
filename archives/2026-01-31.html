    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 31, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Justice and Security</h2>
<p>Newly released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein have shed additional light on his extensive network. The files, totaling three million documents, include hundreds of references to Donald Trump and contain emails between Epstein and an individual referred to as "The Duke." These revelations may provide further context to ongoing investigations into Epstein's associates and activities.</p>
<p>In Israel, a debate has intensified over proposals to reinstate the death penalty specifically for Palestinian attackers. Some members of parliament are pushing for this move, which is seen as highly controversial. The discussions reflect deep divisions within the country on how to address security threats and justice for victims.</p>
<h2>US Government and Political Developments</h2>
<p>The US government remains partially shut down despite a last-minute funding deal. However, the House of Representatives cannot vote on the agreement until Monday, meaning some government operations continue to be affected until then. This shutdown highlights ongoing difficulties in securing timely funding approvals in Washington.</p>
<p>In Canada, the Conservative Party has reaffirmed its leadership by re-electing Pierre Poilievre. He secured a strong 87.4% of delegate support even as his party continues to face challenges after losses to the Liberals in recent elections. This result signals confidence within the party ranks in Poilievre’s leadership going forward.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Culture</h2>
<p>Catherine O'Hara, the Emmy-winning actress known for roles in "Schitt’s Creek" and "Home Alone," has died at age 71 after a brief illness. She passed away at her home in Los Angeles. O’Hara was widely celebrated for her comedic talents and contributions to television and film, leaving a lasting legacy in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>A new documentary titled "Melania," directed by Brett Ratner, offers a brief inside look into the life of the former first lady. Though the film provides a glimpse of her personal story, it leaves many questions unanswered about her time in the public eye, maintaining an air of mystery around her persona.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Despite a recent energy truce, people in Ukraine are preparing for severe winter conditions with temperatures expected to drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius. Many civilians, already facing electricity shortages, are struggling to stay warm. The harsh weather combined with damaged infrastructure threatens to exacerbate the humanitarian situation, raising concerns about a potential catastrophe if adequate aid is not delivered.</p>
<h2>Environment and Wildlife</h2>
<p>An unusual story has emerged from Alcatraz Island, where a coyote has been spotted surviving alone after swimming to the isolated prison site. The animal is reportedly living on a diet of birds. Authorities and observers are considering what the next steps should be for the coyote, balancing wildlife management with the challenges posed by the island's environment.</p>
