    <h2>Epstein Files Released</h2>
<p>More than three million documents related to Jeffrey Epstein have been made public, revealing new details about his connections. Among the papers are hundreds of mentions of Donald Trump and emails between Epstein and someone identified as "The Duke." The extensive files may bring renewed scrutiny to individuals linked to Epstein and prompt further investigations.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Israel and Uganda</h2>
<p>In Israel, a debate is unfolding over a proposal to reinstate the death penalty for Palestinians involved in deadly attacks. The move has sparked controversy among Israeli lawmakers and could have significant implications for security policies and relations in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Uganda, the president’s son, known for provocative statements on social media, has expressed ambitions to succeed his father. His recent remarks, including threats against an opposition leader and claims of descent from Jesus, have drawn attention to the country’s political future and the potential for increased tensions.</p>
<h2>US Government Shutdown Continues</h2>
<p>The US federal government has partially shut down following a delay in approving a funding deal. A last-minute agreement was reached, but the House of Representatives will not be able to vote to end the shutdown until Monday. The ongoing impasse affects government services and adds uncertainty to Washington's legislative agenda.</p>
<h2>Tragic Mine Collapse in DR Congo</h2>
<p>A mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo collapsed after heavy rains, killing more than 200 people according to a local rebel spokesman. The disaster highlights ongoing safety concerns in the country’s mining sector and raises questions about regulatory oversight in hazardous work environments.</p>
<h2>Cultural News: Catherine O’Hara and Pokémon Event Cancellation</h2>
<p>Canadian comedic actress Catherine O’Hara has died in Los Angeles at the age of 71 after a brief illness. Tributes have come from actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, among others, celebrating her influential career in film and television.</p>
<p>Separately, Pokémon has cancelled an event planned at a controversial shrine in Japan. The event faced criticism, particularly from China, for being held at a military memorial site, leading to the decision to withdraw in response to the backlash.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Updates</h2>
<p>In Canada, the Conservative party leader, Pierre Poilievre, was re-elected with 87.4% of delegate votes despite recent losses in federal elections against the Liberals.</p>
<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon has been charged after participating in an anti-ICE protest at a Minnesota church. Lemon maintains he was performing his duties as a journalist while covering the protests.</p>
