    <h2>Major Document Release Sheds Light on Epstein Case</h2>
<p>Three million previously undisclosed documents related to Jeffrey Epstein have been released, revealing new details about the controversial figure. The papers include hundreds of mentions of Donald Trump and email communications between Epstein and someone referred to as “The Duke.” The release adds to ongoing public interest and investigation into Epstein’s activities and associates, potentially leading to further scrutiny of individuals mentioned in the files.</p>
<h2>US Government Faces Partial Shutdown</h2>
<p>Despite reaching a last-minute funding agreement, the US government is partially shut down as Congress has yet to complete the funding vote. The earliest the US House of Representatives can vote on the deal to end the shutdown is Monday. This temporary halt in government operations affects multiple federal services and continues to place pressure on lawmakers to reach a consensus quickly to restore full government function.</p>
<h2>Controversy in Israel Over Death Penalty Proposal</h2>
<p>A faction of Israeli Members of Parliament is pushing to reintroduce the death penalty specifically for Palestinian attackers, sparking a heated debate in the country. The proposal is highly controversial and underscores ongoing tensions related to security and justice measures. The move raises questions about potential legal and societal impacts if the death penalty is reinstated under these circumstances.</p>

<h2>Political Developments in Canada and the US</h2>
