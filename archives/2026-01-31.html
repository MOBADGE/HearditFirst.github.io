    <h2>International News: Ongoing Tensions and Conflict</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes have killed at least 32 Palestinians in Gaza, according to rescue officials. The Israeli military confirmed the strikes took place during a ceasefire, which both Israel and Hamas accuse each other of violating. Meanwhile, reports suggest that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is encouraging the United States, possibly with support from Donald Trump, to take strong action against Iran, hinting at an interest in regime change. These developments contribute to existing regional instability and signal continued diplomatic and security challenges ahead.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Issues: Government and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>The United States is experiencing a partial government shutdown despite a last-minute funding deal. The earliest the House of Representatives can vote on the funding agreement is Monday, prolonging uncertainty over government operations. In Minnesota, a federal judge denied a state request to block a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity. While acknowledging the potential "heartbreaking" consequences of increased enforcement, the judge ruled that the state had not sufficiently proven its case against ICE.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>Tragic incidents have occurred in several countries over the weekend. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, more than 200 people died following a mine collapse, which local rebel sources attribute to heavy rains. Separately, in Iran, multiple gas explosions have killed five people, including a four-year-old child. These events highlight ongoing risks related to safety and infrastructure in vulnerable areas.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business Developments</h2>
<p>SpaceX has applied for permission to launch up to one million satellites into orbit. The company aims to create a global network of "orbital data centres" designed to support artificial intelligence applications. This ambitious project signals a significant expansion of satellite technology and could influence global communications and AI development in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>The entertainment world is mourning the loss of Catherine O'Hara, a Canadian comedic actress who died at the age of 71 after a brief illness. Tributes have been led by actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, recognizing her contributions to film and television. In Japan, the Pokémon franchise has cancelled an event planned at a controversial shrine after receiving backlash, particularly from China, due to the site's association with a military memorial. This decision underscores the sensitivity surrounding historical and cultural sites in international contexts.</p>
<h2>Legal Documents Released</h2>
<p>More than three million documents related to Jeffrey Epstein have been made public, including hundreds of references to Donald Trump and correspondence between Epstein and an individual identified only as "The Duke." The release of these files could impact ongoing investigations and public understanding of Epstein’s network and activities.</p>
