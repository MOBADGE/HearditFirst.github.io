    <h2>International Conflicts and Security</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes have killed at least 32 Palestinians in Gaza, according to rescue officials. The Israeli military confirmed the strikes, which occurred amid a ceasefire that both Israel and Hamas accuse each other of violating. In related news, analysts report that Israel's prime minister is encouraging the United States to conduct maximalist strikes against Iran, potentially aiming for regime change. The reports suggest former US president Trump is seen as a key figure in advancing this strategy.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Emergencies</h2>
<p>A significant mine collapse in the Democratic Republic of Congo has resulted in the deaths of over 200 people. Local reports indicate that heavy rains caused the mine to give way. Separately, Iran experienced a series of gas explosions on Saturday, leading to five deaths and injuring fourteen others. These events raise concerns about industrial safety and emergency preparedness in these regions.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>A federal judge denied a request to block an increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minnesota. While acknowledging potential "heartbreaking" effects of the activity, the judge ruled that the state of Minnesota had not sufficiently proven its case to halt the surge. Meanwhile, the US government faces a partial shutdown despite recently passing a last-minute funding deal. The deal's approval by the House of Representatives, required to fully end the shutdown, cannot take place before Monday, prolonging some government disruptions.</p>
<h2>Technology and Space</h2>
<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX has filed an application to launch one million satellites into orbit. The company aims to create a network of "orbital data centres" intended to support artificial intelligence capabilities. This ambitious project could significantly expand satellite-based data infrastructure, impacting global communications and AI development.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The entertainment community is mourning the death of Canadian comedic actress Catherine O'Hara, who passed away in Los Angeles at age 71 following a brief illness. Tributes have been led by well-known actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, reflecting O'Hara's influence and legacy in comedy and film.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Cultural Controversy</h2>
<p>The popular franchise Pokémon canceled an event planned at a controversial shrine in Japan. The event had been advertised officially but faced backlash, notably from China, due to the shrine's status as a military memorial. The cancellation highlights ongoing sensitivities in cultural events linked to historical issues in the region.</p>
