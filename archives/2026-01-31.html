    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 31, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Conflicts and Security</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes in Gaza have resulted in the deaths of at least 27 Palestinians, according to local rescue officials. The strikes occurred during a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with both sides accusing each other of violations. Meanwhile, within Israel, there is growing debate over a proposal to reintroduce the death penalty specifically for Palestinian attackers. This measure has sparked controversy among Israeli lawmakers as they weigh security concerns against legal and moral considerations.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>In Canada, the opposition Conservative party has reaffirmed its leadership by re-electing Pierre Poilievre with 87.4% of the delegates’ votes. This comes despite the party’s recent losses to the Liberal party in elections. Meanwhile, in Uganda, the president’s son has attracted attention for his outspoken and aggressive comments on social media, including threats directed at opposition figures and unusual claims about his heritage. He is widely viewed as a potential successor to his father.</p>
<h2>Major Tragedies</h2>
<p>Tragic news has emerged from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 200 people were killed when a mine collapsed following heavy rains. The incident took place earlier in the week, and the collapse reflects ongoing safety challenges in mining areas prone to environmental hazards.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>The entertainment world is mourning the death of Catherine O’Hara, a beloved Canadian comedic actress, who passed away at age 71 after a brief illness. She received tributes from notable figures including actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep. In other cultural news, a planned Pokémon event in Japan has been cancelled after criticism arose in China due to the event’s location at a military memorial shrine, highlighting ongoing sensitivities in regional relations.</p>
<h2>United States Government and Media</h2>
<p>The U.S. government faces a partial shutdown despite a last-minute funding deal reached between parties. However, the House of Representatives will not be able to vote on the agreement until Monday, prolonging the uncertainty. Additionally, a documentary about Melania, directed by Brett Ratner, offers only a brief and limited look into the life of the former first lady, leaving many questions about her personal story unanswered.</p>
<h2>Legal and Investigative Updates</h2>
<p>Newly released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein include about three million files with hundreds of mentions of Donald Trump and emails between Epstein and a person referred to as "The Duke." The large volume of material may provide further insights into Epstein’s network and associations, with ongoing public and legal interest in the contents.</p>
