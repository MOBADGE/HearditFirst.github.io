    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 31, 2026</div>
    <h2>Middle East Conflict</h2>
<p>Israeli air strikes in Gaza have killed at least 28 Palestinians, according to rescue officials. The Israeli military confirmed carrying out the strikes amid ongoing tensions. These attacks occurred during a ceasefire period, which both Israel and Hamas accuse each other of violating. In response to recent violence, some Israeli members of parliament are advocating to reinstate the death penalty for Palestinians responsible for deadly attacks. This proposal remains highly controversial within Israel.</p>
<h2>United States Government and Politics</h2>
<p>The US government entered a partial shutdown despite a last-minute funding agreement. The shutdown continues because the earliest the US House of Representatives can vote on the deal is next Monday. The delay means some government operations and services remain affected while lawmakers work toward resolving the funding issues.</p>
<h2>Africa: Tragedies and Politics</h2>
<p>More than 200 people have died after a mine collapsed in the Democratic Republic of Congo following heavy rains. Local rebel representatives confirmed the incident, which happened on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in Uganda, the president’s son, who is known for making inflammatory statements on social media, has expressed ambitions to succeed his father. His controversial remarks include a threat to castrate an opposition leader and claims of descended lineage from Jesus.</p>
<h2>Cultural News</h2>
<p>Canadian comedic actress Catherine O'Hara passed away in Los Angeles at the age of 71 after a brief illness. She received tributes from fellow actors Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, highlighting her significant impact in comedy and film.</p>
<p>In Japan, the Pokémon Company cancelled a planned event at a shrine that also serves as a military memorial. The event faced backlash, particularly from China, due to the shrine's controversial history.</p>
<h2>Politics in Canada</h2>
<p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada's Conservative party, won a leadership test with a strong majority, receiving 87.4% support from party delegates. This endorsement comes despite his recent electoral loss to the Liberal party, confirming his position as opposition leader.</p>
<h2>Epstein Document Release</h2>
<p>A large batch of new documents related to Jeffrey Epstein was released, comprising three million pages. The files include hundreds of mentions of Donald Trump and emails involving Epstein and an individual referred to as "The Duke." This release could provide additional details related to ongoing public and legal interest in Epstein's network.</p>
