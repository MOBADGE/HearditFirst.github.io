    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 31, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Politics</h2>
<p>Israel is experiencing a deep division over a proposal to reintroduce the death penalty specifically for Palestinians who carry out attacks. This contentious measure has sparked debate with some lawmakers arguing that it could act as a deterrent, while others see it as a highly controversial step that raises ethical and legal questions.</p>
<p>In Uganda, political tensions are rising around the president’s son, who is known for making provocative statements on social media. He has declared ambitions to follow in his father's footsteps and lead the country, contributing to speculation about the future political landscape there.</p>
<h2>United States Government and Legal News</h2>
<p>The US government is partially shut down after a last-minute funding agreement failed to secure immediate approval. The House of Representatives will not be able to vote on the deal until Monday, prolonging the shutdown for the time being. Meanwhile, former CNN host Don Lemon faces charges related to his involvement at an anti-ICE protest in a Minnesota church. Lemon has defended his actions, saying he was performing his duties as a journalist covering the event.</p>
<h2>Canada Political Update</h2>
<p>Pierre Poilievre has been re-elected as leader of Canada’s Conservative Party, receiving 87.4% of delegate votes. This strong endorsement comes despite recent losses for the party in elections against the governing Liberals, signaling continued confidence among party members in Poilievre’s leadership.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns in Ukraine</h2>
<p>As temperatures are expected to drop as low as -20°C, many Ukrainians face severe hardships due to ongoing electricity shortages despite a recently negotiated energy truce. Civilians are struggling to stay warm in their homes, with concerns growing that the situation could become catastrophic if energy supplies do not improve.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The entertainment world mourns the passing of Canadian comedic actress Catherine O’Hara, who died at age 71 after a brief illness. Tributes have come from notable figures including Pedro Pascal and Meryl Streep, reflecting her significant impact on comedy and film.</p>
<p>In other entertainment news, a documentary about Melania, directed by Brett Ratner, offers a brief and elusive look into the life of the former first lady. However, many viewers felt it left many questions unanswered about her personal story.</p>
<h2>Controversies in Japan and Global News</h2>
<p>The Pokémon Company cancelled a planned event at a shrine in Japan after backlash, especially from China. The shrine is a military memorial, and the event’s association with it drew criticism, leading to the cancellation.</p>
<p>Additionally, new materials released about Jeffrey Epstein have surfaced in millions of documents that include numerous mentions of Donald Trump and communications involving someone referred to as “The Duke,” renewing public interest in the case.</p>
