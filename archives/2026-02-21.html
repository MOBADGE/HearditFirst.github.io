    <h2>Trade and Tariffs</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court has struck down some of President Donald Trump's broad global import taxes, creating new uncertainty in international trade. In response, Trump introduced a new 10% tariff despite the court's ruling. He strongly criticized the six justices who voted against the tariffs, saying they should be "absolutely ashamed." This decision challenges a key part of Trump's economic approach and could affect trade relationships going forward.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions</h2>
<p>Violence continues to escalate in the Middle East. Israeli air strikes in Lebanon killed at least 10 people in what officials describe as some of the deadliest attacks since a ceasefire ended prior conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. At the same time, the Palestinian Authority faces increasing pressure as Israel’s control over the West Bank deepens. More than 30 years after its formation, experts warn the Palestinian Authority is nearing collapse. In a separate but related event, the family of Palestinian-American Nasrallah Abu Siyam, the sixth American killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the West Bank over two years, is demanding accountability.</p>
<h2>Political Challenges in France</h2>
<p>France’s far-left political movement is facing serious difficulties ahead of upcoming elections following the killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student. Far-left militants are suspected in the death, leading to widespread condemnation of Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s party. This incident may have significant repercussions for the far-left's political prospects.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accidents and Health</h2>
<p>A series of tragedies have been reported in Europe. Five people were killed in avalanches in the Austrian Alps, including a man skiing with his son. This brings this winter’s avalanche-related deaths in the region to at least 21. Meanwhile, in Italy, a two-year-old toddler named Domenico died following a heart transplant after the donated heart was reportedly severely damaged by frostbite during transportation.</p>
<h2>Technology and Security</h2>
<p>OpenAI revealed that the ChatGPT account linked to a suspect in the Tumbler Ridge shooting was banned before the incident. However, the account’s activity did not reach the level required to alert authorities at the time. This highlights the challenges in monitoring online tools for early warning signs of potential violence.</p>
<h2>Notable Deaths</h2>
<p>Anna Murdoch-Mann, an author, journalist, philanthropist, and former director at News Corp, died at the age of 81 at her Florida home. Her passing was announced by Rupert Murdoch’s news outlets.</p>
