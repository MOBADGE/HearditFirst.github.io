    <h2>Protests and Conflict in Iran and the Middle East</h2>
<p>Thousands of students in Iran have staged large anti-government protests, marking the first major demonstrations since a deadly crackdown on nationwide protests last month. These student protesters gathered to honor those who were killed during the earlier unrest. The events indicate ongoing tension and discontent in the country.</p>
<p>In the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority (PA) is facing significant challenges as Israel's control over the region continues to expand. More than 30 years after its establishment, there are increasing concerns that the PA is close to collapsing amid these pressures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed at least 10 people. These strikes are reported to be some of the deadliest since a ceasefire ended the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, raising fears of renewed violence in the area.</p>
<h2>Impact on Political Groups in France</h2>
<p>The French far-left political movement is experiencing turmoil following the killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student. Far-left militants are suspected in the incident, leading to widespread condemnation of the party associated with Jean-Luc Mélenchon as elections approach. This development could affect the political landscape and voter sentiment in France.</p>
<h2>Delays in Space Exploration</h2>
<p>Nasa has postponed its mission to the far side of the Moon due to problems discovered with the rocket. The delay will impact the space agency's plans for lunar exploration and its timeline for returning astronauts from this mission. Officials have not specified a new launch date.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accident in Siberia</h2>
<p>Divers have recovered the bodies of seven Chinese tourists along with a Russian driver after their minibus plunged through ice and sank to the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia. The accident is a tragic reminder of the dangers posed by extreme winter conditions in the region.</p>
<h2>Environmental Success in the Galápagos</h2>
<p>A conservation effort has led to the reintroduction of 158 juvenile giant tortoises to a Galápagos island nearly 200 years after the native species was driven to extinction by sailors in the 1800s. This marks a significant milestone in the restoration of the island’s ecosystem and the preservation of biodiversity.</p>
<h2>Notable Deaths and Cultural Updates</h2>
<p>Anna Murdoch-Mann, an author, journalist, and former director at News Corp, has died at the age of 81 at her home in Florida. Her work and philanthropy have left a lasting impact on the media and literary worlds.</p>
<p>In entertainment news, Manon, a member of the six-person girl group Katseye, announced a temporary hiatus to focus on her health. The group emphasized that the decision came after "open and thoughtful conversations," highlighting the importance of well-being in the music industry.</p>
