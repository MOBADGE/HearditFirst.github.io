    <h2>Protests and Political Unrest</h2>
<p>Students in Iran held their first large-scale anti-government protests since a deadly crackdown on nationwide demonstrations last month. The students paid tribute to thousands who lost their lives during the previous protests, signaling continuing dissatisfaction and tension within the country.</p>
<p>In France, the far-left political scene faces deep trouble ahead of upcoming elections following the killing of nationalist student Quentin Deranque. Far-left militants are suspected in his death, and the party associated with Jean-Luc Mélenchon has been widely condemned, raising questions about political violence and polarization in the lead-up to the vote.</p>
<h2>Middle East Violence</h2>
<p>Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed at least ten people, marking some of the deadliest violence in Lebanon since the ceasefire that ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah. The strikes contribute to ongoing instability in the region.</p>
<p>Separately, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man killed in the West Bank, has called for accountability. He is the sixth American citizen to be killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the area over the past two years, highlighting persistent tensions and conflict in the West Bank.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration Delay</h2>
<p>NASA has announced a delay to its mission aimed at exploring the far side of the Moon and returning to Earth. The postponement comes after problems were detected with the mission’s rocket, underscoring the challenges of space exploration and the need for thorough safety checks before launch.</p>
<h2>Environmental and Wildlife Conservation</h2>
<p>Efforts to restore a native species have seen progress with the reintroduction of 158 juvenile giant tortoises to a Galápagos island after nearly 200 years of local extinction. The species had previously been wiped out by sailors in the 1800s. This development is an important step for biodiversity and the ecological health of the island.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Siberia, divers recovered the bodies of seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver after their mini-bus plunged beneath the ice at the bottom of Lake Baikal. This tragic accident draws attention to the risks associated with travel in harsh winter conditions.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Health Updates</h2>
<p>The Austrian Alps reported five avalanche deaths, including a man skiing with his son, raising this season’s total avalanche fatalities in the region to at least 21. These events serve as a reminder of the dangers involved in winter sports and mountain travel.</p>
<p>In entertainment news, Manon of the girl group Katseye announced a temporary hiatus to focus on her health. The decision followed open and thoughtful discussions within the six-member group, showing a mindful approach to well-being in the performing arts industry.</p>
<h2>Notable Death</h2>
<p>Anna Murdoch-Mann, a writer, journalist and former director at News Corp, has died at the age of 81 at her home in Florida. She was known for her contributions to literature and philanthropy, and her passing was reported by outlets linked to Rupert Murdoch.</p>
