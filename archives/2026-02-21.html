    <h2>U.S. Tariffs and Supreme Court Ruling</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump sharply criticized a recent Supreme Court decision that struck down tariffs he had implemented as part of his economic policy. He said the six justices who voted against the tariffs should be "absolutely ashamed." This ruling represents a significant setback for a policy that was central to Trump's approach to trade. The decision could influence future trade and economic policies, although further developments remain to be seen.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions in the Middle East and West Bank</h2>
<p>Violence continues to escalate in the region. Israeli military strikes in Lebanon have killed at least 10 people, marking some of the deadliest attacks since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority faces increasing pressure as Israel deepens its control over the West Bank. Observers have raised concerns that the Palestinian Authority may be close to collapse more than 30 years after its establishment. Additionally, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man recently killed in the West Bank, is calling for accountability. He is the sixth American citizen reportedly killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the area over the past two years.</p>
<h2>Political Fallout in France Ahead of Elections</h2>
<p>The French far left is confronting serious difficulties following the killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student. Far-left militants are suspected in the death, which has reignited criticism of the party led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. This event has heightened tensions in the political landscape as France approaches elections, potentially affecting voter sentiment and party dynamics.</p>
<h2>NASA Moon Mission Delay</h2>
<p>NASA has announced that its mission to the far side of the Moon and back will likely be postponed due to problems detected with the mission’s rocket. A NASA official confirmed the technical issues that could delay this important lunar exploration initiative. The delay highlights the complexities and challenges involved in space missions and could push back NASA’s plans for further exploration around the Moon.</p>
<h2>Environmental Conservation Success: Galápagos Giant Tortoises Return</h2>
<p>In a positive environmental development, 158 juvenile giant tortoises have been reintroduced to a Galápagos island where the species had gone extinct nearly 200 years ago. Sailors drove these tortoises to extinction in the 1800s, but conservation efforts have now helped revive the native population. This reintroduction marks a significant milestone for wildlife restoration and ecological preservation in the Galápagos archipelago.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>The family members of Anna Murdoch-Mann, a writer and former News Corp director, announced she passed away at age 81 at her home in Florida. Additionally, the six-member girl group Katseye has said that one of their members, Manon, will take a temporary hiatus to focus on her health after the group collectively made the decision following thoughtful conversations.</p>
