    <h2>Protests and Political Tensions in Iran and the West Bank</h2>
<p>Students in Iran held their first large anti-government protests since a deadly crackdown last month. The demonstrators honoured thousands who were killed during nationwide protests that challenged the government. This marks a notable moment of unrest as the country faces ongoing political conflict.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority faces serious challenges in the West Bank. More than 30 years after its establishment, concerns are growing that the Authority may be close to collapse due to increasing Israeli control over the area. This situation is compounded by continued violence, including the killing of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man, by Israeli settlers or soldiers. His family is calling for accountability, highlighting the ongoing tensions and deadly encounters in the region.</p>
<h2>Violence and Political Fallout in France and Lebanon</h2>
<p>In France, the death of nationalist student Quentin Deranque has caused significant political controversy. Far-left militants are suspected to be involved, and the party associated with Jean-Luc Mélenchon faces widespread condemnation. With elections approaching, this incident is deepening divisions within the left-wing political landscape.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 10 people. These strikes are reported to be among the deadliest in Lebanon since the ceasefire that ended the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The violence may escalate regional instability, with serious implications for Lebanon's security and its relations with Israel.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration Delayed</h2>
<p>NASA has announced a postponement of its mission to the far side of the Moon and back. The delay arises because of problems detected with the mission's rocket. This setback could affect planned exploration and research activities, though NASA is working to resolve the issues before proceeding.</p>
<h2>Environmental Success in the Galápagos</h2>
<p>In positive environmental news, 158 juvenile giant tortoises have been reintroduced to a Galápagos island. This marks the return of a native species that had been driven to extinction by sailors in the 1800s. The reintroduction is an important step for conservation efforts in the archipelago and helps restore its ecological balance.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Events</h2>
<p>In Siberia, divers have recovered the bodies of seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver after their mini-bus fell through ice into Lake Baikal.</p>
<p>This tragic accident has brought attention to safety concerns in the region's frozen waterways.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, the girl group Katseye's Manon announced a temporary hiatus from their music career to focus on her health.</p>
<p>The decision came after open discussions among group members, showing a supportive approach to personal well-being in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Lastly, Anna Murdoch-Mann, a writer and former director at News Corp, has died at age 81 in Florida.</p>
<p>She was also known for her philanthropy and work as a journalist.</p>
