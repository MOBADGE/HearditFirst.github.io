    <h2>US Politics and Supreme Court Ruling</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump criticized the Supreme Court's recent decision to reject tariffs he had supported as a key part of his economic policy. Trump said the six justices who ruled against the tariffs should be "absolutely ashamed." This ruling marks a significant setback for a policy aimed at protecting American industries. The debate over tariffs and trade policies is likely to continue, especially as these decisions affect economic relations and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Palestinian Authority</h2>
<p>The situation in the West Bank remains tense, with growing concerns about the stability of the Palestinian Authority (PA). More than 30 years after its establishment, warnings suggest the PA is close to collapse amid increasing Israeli control in the region. Meanwhile, Israeli military strikes in Lebanon have killed at least 10 people, marking some of the deadliest violence since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah ended the war. Additionally, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man killed in the West Bank, is calling for accountability. He is the sixth American citizen to have died in similar circumstances involving Israeli settlers or soldiers over the past two years.</p>
<h2>French Political Climate and Violence</h2>
<p>In France, the death of Quentin Deranque, a student with nationalist views, has put the far-left political groups in a difficult position ahead of upcoming elections. Far-left militants are suspected of involvement in his death, prompting widespread condemnation of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's party. This event could influence voter perceptions and the broader political landscape as France approaches its elections.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration Update</h2>
<p>NASA's planned mission to the far side of the Moon and back is likely to face delays following problems identified with the mission’s rocket. NASA officials have indicated that resolving these issues is necessary before proceeding, which may push timelines back. The delay reflects the technical challenges of deep-space missions but highlights ongoing efforts to advance lunar exploration.</p>
<h2>Environmental Success in the Galápagos</h2>
<p>In a positive environmental development, 158 juvenile giant tortoises have been reintroduced to a Galápagos island after nearly 200 years. The native species was driven to extinction by sailors in the 1800s, and this effort marks a significant step toward restoring the island's original ecosystem. Conservationists are hopeful that this reintroduction will help revive the species and support biodiversity in the region.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accident in Siberia</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck in Siberia where the bodies of seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver were recovered after their mini-bus plunged under a frozen part of Lake Baikal. The incident underscores the risks of travel in remote and icy conditions in the region, and investigations are likely to follow to understand what caused the accident.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>Anna Murdoch-Mann, an author, journalist, philanthropist, and former director at News Corp, has died aged 81 at her home in Florida. Her passing was announced by Rupert Murdoch’s news organizations, honoring her contributions to literature and media.</p>
<p>In the music world, the girl group Katseye’s Manon has announced she will take a "temporary hiatus" to focus on her health. The group made the decision after open discussions together, showing the importance of supporting member well-being in performing arts.</p>
