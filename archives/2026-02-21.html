    <h2>Global Trade and Tariffs</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court struck down some of the broad tariffs implemented during Donald Trump's administration, creating uncertainty in global trade markets. These import taxes had been a key part of Trump's economic policies. In response, Trump introduced a new 10% tariff, signaling his intention to maintain a protectionist trade stance despite the judiciary's ruling. Trump also strongly criticized the six Supreme Court justices who voted against the tariffs, saying they should be "absolutely ashamed." This dispute highlights ongoing tensions over trade policy and could impact international economic relations moving forward.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Violence</h2>
<p>Recent violence in the Middle East has raised concerns over regional stability. Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed at least 10 people, marking one of the deadliest incidents since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority (PA) faces an increasingly precarious position more than 30 years after its establishment, with warnings that it may be nearing collapse as Israel deepens its control of the West Bank. Additionally, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man killed in the West Bank, is demanding accountability. Abu Siyam is the sixth American citizen to have died in similar circumstances involving Israeli settlers or soldiers in the area over the past two years.</p>
<h2>French Politics and Social Unrest</h2>
<p>The French far left faces significant challenges after the death of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student. Far-left militants are suspected of involvement in his killing, leading to widespread condemnation of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's party. This incident complicates the political landscape ahead of upcoming elections, potentially reshaping voter sentiments and alliances.</p>
<h2>Health and Entertainment News</h2>
<p>The six-member girl group Katseye announced that their member Manon will take a "temporary hiatus" to focus on her health. This decision was made after collective discussions within the group. In related news, Anna Murdoch-Mann, a writer, journalist, and former director at News Corp, died at the age of 81 at her home in Florida. She was recognized for her contributions to journalism and philanthropy.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Tragedies</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck in the Austrian Alps where avalanches killed five people, including a man skiing with his son. These fatalities increase the season’s avalanche death toll in the region to at least 21. Meanwhile, in Italy, a two-year-old boy named Domenico died after receiving a heart transplant. Reports indicated that the donated heart was severely damaged, described as "burned by frostbite," during its transport to the hospital. This rare and devastating event raises questions about transplant procedures and organ transport safety.</p>
