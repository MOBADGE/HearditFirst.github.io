    <h2>Global Trade and Tariffs</h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down several of the tariffs imposed during Donald Trump's administration, casting doubt on this key element of his economic policy. The decision rejected some of Trump's broad import taxes that had affected global trade. In response, Trump criticized the six justices who voted against the tariffs, saying they should be "absolutely ashamed." Following the ruling, his team announced a new 10% tariff, signaling ongoing shifts in trade policy that could affect international markets. The court's decision brings uncertainty about how future tariff measures may be implemented or challenged.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Violence</h2>
<p>Violence continues to escalate in the Middle East, with Israeli airstrikes killing at least ten people in Lebanon. These strikes are among the deadliest since the ceasefire that ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah. Concurrently, the Palestinian Authority faces serious challenges, with increasing signs it may be nearing collapse more than 30 years after its creation, as Israel deepens its control over the West Bank. The situation is further compounded by the killing of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man, marking the sixth American citizen killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the West Bank over two years. His family is calling for accountability.</p>
<h2>French Politics and Social Unrest</h2>
<p>In France, the far-left political movement is facing deep difficulties ahead of upcoming elections following the killing of nationalist student Quentin Deranque. Far-left militants are suspected to be involved in the death, provoking widespread condemnation of the party linked to Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The incident is shaking the political landscape and could influence voter sentiment as France prepares for its elections.</p>
<h2>Regional Tragedies: Alps Avalanches and Medical Incident in Italy</h2>
<p>The Austrian Alps have seen a winter marked by multiple fatal avalanches, with five people recently killed, including a man skiing with his son. The total deaths from avalanches in the region this season now stand at 21, highlighting ongoing risks for winter sports enthusiasts and local communities.</p>
<p>In Italy, a tragic medical incident occurred when a two-year-old toddler, Domenico, died after receiving a heart transplant. Reports indicate the donated heart was severely damaged by frostbite during transfer to the hospital, raising concerns about the logistics of organ transportation and the safety of transplant procedures.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Cultural News</h2>
<p>The six-member girl group Katseye announced that member Manon will take a temporary hiatus to focus on her health. The decision came after "open and thoughtful conversations," showing the group's supportive approach to wellbeing.</p>
<p>In cultural news, Anna Murdoch-Mann, an author, journalist, and former director at News Corp, passed away at 81. Her death was reported by news outlets associated with Rupert Murdoch. She was recognized for her contributions to journalism and philanthropy.</p>
