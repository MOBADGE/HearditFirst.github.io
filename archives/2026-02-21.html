    <h2>Global Trade and Tariff Changes</h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down some of the extensive tariffs introduced under Donald Trump’s administration, creating uncertainty in global trade. These tariffs had significantly shaped international economic policies. In response, Trump introduced a new 10% tariff despite the ruling, signaling ongoing trade tensions. Trump also strongly criticized the six justices who opposed the tariffs, saying they should be "absolutely ashamed." This development could lead to further disputes over trade policy and affect markets worldwide as businesses adjust to the shifting regulatory environment.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Conflict</h2>
<p>In the Middle East, violence and political instability continue to escalate. Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed at least 10 people, marking some of the deadliest attacks since a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority (PA) faces growing challenges and is reported to be nearing collapse after more than three decades of existence. This deepening crisis is compounded by ongoing violence in the West Bank, where Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man, was recently killed. His family demands accountability as he is the sixth American citizen to die in the region in two years due to clashes involving Israeli settlers or soldiers.</p>
<h2>Political Trouble in France</h2>
<p>The French far left is facing significant backlash following the killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student. Far-left militants are suspected of involvement in the death, which has led to widespread condemnation of the party associated with Jean-Luc Mélenchon. This incident comes at a sensitive time as France approaches upcoming elections, potentially impacting voter support for far-left groups and altering the political landscape.</p>
<h2>Health and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Manon, a member of the six-person girl group Katseye, announced she will take a temporary break from the group to focus on her health. The decision was made collaboratively within the band after thoughtful discussions, highlighting the increasing attention to mental and physical well-being in the entertainment industry. Fans and the music community await updates on her recovery and the band's future plans.</p>
<h2>Tragic Incidents and Losses</h2>
<p>Several tragic events have marked the day across different regions. In the Austrian Alps, avalanches have claimed the lives of five people, including a man skiing with his son. This brings the season’s avalanche death toll in the area to at least 21, drawing attention to the risks of winter sports and the need for caution. In Italy, a two-year-old toddler named Domenico died after a heart transplant went wrong; the donated heart was reportedly severely damaged by frostbite during transport. Additionally, Anna Murdoch-Mann, a writer, journalist, and former director at News Corp, passed away at the age of 81. Her contributions to media and philanthropy were recognized by Rupert Murdoch’s news outlets.</p>
