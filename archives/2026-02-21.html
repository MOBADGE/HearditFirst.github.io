    <h2>Protests and Unrest in Iran and the West Bank</h2>
<p>Students in Iran held their first anti-government protests since a recent deadly crackdown on mass demonstrations. The students honoured thousands who were killed amid nationwide protests last month, signalling ongoing unrest and public dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions in the West Bank remain high. The family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man killed in the region, is demanding accountability. He was the sixth American citizen to die due to violence involving Israeli settlers or soldiers there in the past two years. At the same time, the Palestinian Authority faces increasing pressure, with warnings that it is nearing collapse more than 30 years after its establishment. Israeli military strikes in Lebanon also resulted in at least 10 deaths, marking some of the deadliest incidents since the last ceasefire with Hezbollah.</p>
<h2>Political Turmoil in France</h2>

Far-left militants are suspected to be involved, leading to widespread condemnation of the party associated with Jean-Luc Mélenchon. This development comes as elections approach, potentially impacting the far left’s political standing.</p>
<h2>Space Mission Delayed</h2>
<p>Nasa has postponed its mission to the far side of the Moon and back after detecting issues with its rocket. The delay highlights the challenges of space exploration and will require further investigation and fixing before the mission can proceed.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accident in Siberia</h2>
<p>Seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver died when a mini-bus they were travelling in plunged beneath the ice at the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia. Divers were able to recover the bodies, marking a tragic end to what was likely a tourist expedition in the region.</p>
<h2>Environmental Conservation Success</h2>
<p>In positive news for wildlife conservation, 158 juvenile giant tortoises have been reintroduced to a Galápagos island where the species had been extinct for nearly 200 years. The tortoises were driven to extinction by sailors in the 1800s, and this return marks a hopeful step in restoring the island’s native ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Entertainment Updates</h2>
<p>Anna Murdoch-Mann, an author, journalist, and former director at News Corp, has died at her home in Florida at the age of 81. Her passing was reported by news outlets associated with Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p>Additionally, the girl group Katseye has announced that member Manon will take a temporary hiatus to focus on her health. The decision was made after open and thoughtful discussions within the group.</p>
