    <h2>Global Trade and Tariffs</h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of the global import tariffs introduced during Donald Trump's administration, creating uncertainty in international trade policies. In response to the ruling, Trump has announced a new 10% tariff, indicating his intention to maintain a tough stance on imports. Trump criticized the six justices who voted against his tariffs, saying they should feel "absolutely ashamed". This decision marks a significant challenge to the trade policies that were central to his economic agenda and may affect global markets and trade negotiations.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Developments</h2>
<p>Violence and political instability continue in the Middle East. Israeli air strikes in Lebanon have killed at least 10 people, marking some of the deadliest attacks in Lebanon since a ceasefire with Hezbollah was established. Meanwhile, concerns about the Palestinian Authority's stability are growing. More than 30 years after it was formed, warnings suggest the PA may be nearing collapse due to Israel's increasing control over the West Bank. In related news, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man killed in the West Bank, is demanding accountability. Abu Siyam is the sixth American citizen reported killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the area over the past two years, highlighting ongoing tensions.</p>
<h2>French Political Climate</h2>
<p>The French far-left is facing significant challenges following the killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student. Far-left militants are suspected of involvement, and this incident has led to widespread condemnation of the far-left party associated with Jean-Luc Mélenchon. With elections approaching, this event may have a notable impact on political dynamics and public opinion in France.</p>
<h2>Health and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The girl group Katseye’s member Manon will take a "temporary hiatus" to focus on her health. The group announced the decision came after "open and thoughtful conversations" among members. This break may affect the band's activities in the near term as they prioritize wellness.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Tragedies</h2>
<p>Recent avalanches in the Austrian Alps have killed five people, including a man skiing with his son. This winter’s avalanche death toll in the region has reached at least 21, underscoring the dangers posed by current weather and snow conditions. In Italy, a tragic medical incident occurred when a two-year-old toddler named Domenico died after receiving a heart transplant. The heart was reportedly severely damaged by frostbite during transfer to the hospital, raising concerns about the handling of organ transplants.</p>
<h2>Notable Death</h2>
<p>Anna Murdoch-Mann, a writer, journalist, philanthropist, and former director at News Corp, has died at the age of 81 at her home in Florida. The news was shared by outlets associated with Rupert Murdoch. Her passing marks the loss of a notable figure in media and literature.</p>
