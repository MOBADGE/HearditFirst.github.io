    <h2>US Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump criticized the Supreme Court justices who ruled against his tariffs policy. Six justices voted to strike down tariffs that had been a central part of his economic agenda. Trump said these justices should be "absolutely ashamed" for their decision. The ruling represents a significant setback to his economic approach and may affect future trade policies and disputes.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Conflict</h2>
<p>Several troubling events have increased tensions in the Middle East. Israeli strikes in Lebanon killed at least 10 people, marking some of the deadliest attacks since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority faces a deepening crisis, with warnings that it could collapse after more than three decades. Additionally, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man killed in the West Bank, is demanding accountability. Abu Siyam is the sixth American citizen to have died in the West Bank due to settler or military violence in the past two years.</p>
<h2>France’s Political Climate</h2>
<p>The killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student, has put the French far left under intense scrutiny less than two months before elections. Far-left militants are suspected of being involved in his death, leading to widespread condemnation of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's party. This incident could influence voter sentiment and the balance of political power in France.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Accidents</h2>
<p>Safety concerns have arisen from recent accidents across different regions. In Siberia, divers recovered the bodies of seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver after their minibus plunged through ice into Lake Baikal. In Austria’s Alps, avalanches have killed five people this season, including a man skiing with his son, raising the death toll in the region to at least 21. In Italy, a two-year-old toddler named Domenico died after receiving a heart transplant where the organ was severely damaged by frostbite during transit.</p>
<h2>Culture and Health</h2>
<p>In the entertainment world, the girl group Katseye announced that member Manon will take a temporary hiatus to focus on her health, a decision made after group discussions. Separately, Anna Murdoch-Mann, a writer, journalist, philanthropist, and former director at News Corp, died at her Florida home at the age of 81. Her passing was reported by Rupert Murdoch's news outlets.</p>
