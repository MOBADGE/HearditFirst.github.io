    <h2>US Tariffs and Supreme Court Ruling</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court has struck down some of the global import tariffs imposed under former US President Donald Trump’s administration. This ruling challenges key aspects of his economic policy and creates uncertainty around future global trade relations. In response, Trump announced a new 10% tariff on imports, signaling his continued focus on using tariffs despite the court setback. The ruling also raises questions about whether refunds will be issued for tariffs previously applied but now considered unlawful. Trump criticized the six justices who ruled against the tariffs as "absolutely ashamed," underscoring the ongoing political debate around trade measures.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Violence</h2>
<p>Violence continued in the Middle East with multiple developments reported on the same day. At least 10 people were killed in Israeli air strikes targeting areas in Lebanon, including the Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon. Among the dead was a senior Hezbollah official, marking a significant escalation given the group's political and military influence. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man who was recently killed, called for accountability. Abu Siyam is the sixth American citizen to have died in the West Bank due to clashes involving Israeli settlers or soldiers over the past two years.</p>
<h2>Political Violence in France</h2>
<p>France is facing political turmoil ahead of upcoming elections following the killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student. Far-left militants are suspected in the attack, leading to widespread criticism of the far-left political movement associated with Jean-Luc Mélenchon. This incident has deepened divisions within French politics and may influence voter sentiment as the elections approach.</p>
<h2>Avalanche Tragedy in Austria</h2>
<p>The Austrian Alps continue to be dangerous this winter season, with avalanches claiming at least five more lives recently. Among the victims was a man skiing with his son. This brings the season’s total avalanche-related deaths in the region to at least 21. The ongoing danger from avalanches highlights the risks for winter sports enthusiasts and the challenges for local authorities managing safety in mountainous areas.</p>
<h2>Reflections on War in Ukraine</h2>
<p>A photo feature highlights how the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in 2022, has shaped the lives of ordinary Ukrainians. Six men and women currently serving in the Ukrainian armed forces share their experiences, providing personal insight into the conflict’s impact on individuals and society. This glimpse into military service underscores the profound changes the war has brought to Ukraine’s people.</p>
<h2>Notable Death</h2>
<p>Anna Murdoch-Mann, an author, journalist, philanthropist, and former director at News Corp, has died at the age of 81. She passed away at her home in Florida. Her death was reported by media outlets linked to Rupert Murdoch, marking the loss of a prominent figure in the worlds of media and literature.</p>
