    <h2>Global Trade and Tariffs</h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of the broad import tariffs implemented by Donald Trump, creating new uncertainty around global trade policies. Despite this setback, Trump introduced a new 10% global tariff aimed at continuing his economic strategy. Questions remain about whether importers who paid the invalidated tariffs will be able to receive refunds. The ruling and Trump's response highlight ongoing trade tensions and the complex legal and economic challenges involved in adjusting tariff policies.</p>
<h2>Middle East Conflict and Violence</h2>
<p>Tensions continue in the Middle East with recent violence in the West Bank and Lebanon. Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man, was killed, marking the sixth American citizen killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the West Bank over the past two years. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and southern regions reportedly killed at least 10 people, including a senior Hezbollah official. These developments underscore the fragile and volatile security situation in the region.</p>
<h2>Political Impact in France</h2>
<p>The upcoming French elections have been shaken by the killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student. Far-left militants are suspected to be involved in his death, leading to broad condemnation of the far-left party associated with Jean-Luc Mélenchon. This incident has created significant difficulties for the far left as it seeks to mobilize support in the election period.</p>
<h2>Personal Stories from Conflict and Culture</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, portraits of six men and women in uniform reveal how the ongoing war with Russia, which began in 2022, has influenced and changed ordinary citizens who have joined the military. Their stories provide a human perspective on the impact of war and resilience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cultural highlights from Nigeria include a vibrant fishing festival known for its days of competition aimed at promoting local peace. This event showcases community efforts to strengthen harmony through tradition.</p>
<h2>Notable Death and Film Spotlight</h2>
<p>Anna Murdoch-Mann, an author, journalist, and philanthropist, and mother of an heir to News Corp, passed away at the age of 81 in Florida. Her death was reported by Rupert Murdoch’s news outlets.</p>
<p>Additionally, an Oscar-anticipated film features Sara Shahverdi, a motorcycling midwife and rights campaigner in Iran. As the only female leader in her region, her story shines light on efforts for change amidst considerable societal challenges.</p>
