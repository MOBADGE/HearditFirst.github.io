    <h2>Global Trade and Tariffs</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court has struck down some of Donald Trump's global import taxes, creating uncertainty in international trade. The decision overturned several of the sweeping tariffs introduced during Trump's time in office. In response, Trump has announced a new 10% global tariff aiming to replace those invalidated measures. The ruling also raised questions about whether companies and consumers can seek refunds for tariffs deemed unlawful. This development marks a significant shift in US trade policy, with potential ripple effects for global markets. How the new tariffs will be implemented and challenged remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Political Reactions and Controversies</h2>
<p>Donald Trump sharply criticized the Supreme Court justices behind the ruling against his tariffs, saying the six who voted against his policies should be "absolutely ashamed." This public rebuke reflects high tensions around the issue and highlights ongoing divisions over trade policy in the US. Meanwhile, in France, the far-left is facing criticism after the killing of nationalist student Quentin Deranque. Far-left militants are suspected, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s party is widely condemned as elections approach. These events could influence political narratives and voter sentiment in both countries.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions and Violence</h2>
<p>Violence continues to escalate in parts of the Middle East. At least ten people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley and southern regions, including a senior Hezbollah official, according to state media. The strikes are part of ongoing military activity in the region that contributes to instability. Additionally, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man killed in the West Bank, is demanding accountability. Abu Siyam was the sixth American citizen to die in such circumstances over the past two years involving Israeli settlers or soldiers, raising continued concerns about violence and civilian safety.</p>
<h2>Social and Cultural Stories</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, ordinary citizens’ lives have been deeply shaped by war since Russia’s invasion in 2022. A feature shows six Ukrainians in military uniform sharing how the conflict has changed them personally and socially, highlighting resilience and national identity in wartime. In Nigeria, a traditional fishing festival culminates in a competitive contest designed to promote local peace, illustrating how cultural practices can foster community harmony.</p>
<h2>Arts and Human Rights</h2>
<p>Sara Shahverdi, an Iranian motorcycling midwife and rights activist, is featured in a new documentary film gaining Oscar buzz. Despite being the only female leader in her region, she advocates for women’s rights and social change under challenging circumstances. In other news, Anna Murdoch-Mann, an author, journalist, and former News Corp director, passed away at age 81. She was recognized for her contributions to media and philanthropy.</p>
<p>These stories today show how legal decisions, political tensions, regional conflicts, social resilience, and cultural achievements intersect globally. They give a snapshot of events shaping economies, communities, and individual lives.</p>
