    <h2>Political Protests and Tensions</h2>
<p>Students in Iran held the first large anti-government protests since a recent deadly crackdown on nationwide demonstrations. These protesters gathered to honor the thousands who lost their lives when earlier mass protests were suppressed last month. In the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority faces growing instability, with warnings that it may be nearing collapse after more than 30 years since its formation. The area remains volatile as Israeli control deepens.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, Israeli strikes killed at least 10 people. These strikes are among the deadliest in Lebanon since the ceasefire that ended the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, the family of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, a Palestinian-American man killed there, is calling for accountability. He was the sixth American citizen to die in the area over the past two years due to violence involving Israeli settlers or soldiers.</p>
<h2>Violence and Political Impact in France</h2>
<p>In France, the killing of Quentin Deranque, a nationalist student, has stirred controversy just ahead of elections. Far-left militants are suspected of involvement, and the party led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon has faced widespread condemnation as a result. This incident is causing significant difficulties for the French far left as the country prepares for upcoming elections.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration Update</h2>
<p>NASA announced a delay in its planned mission to the far side of the Moon and back. The postponement follows the discovery of problems with the rocket intended for the mission. NASA officials have not provided a new date for the launch but emphasized the need to address the issue before proceeding.</p>
<h2>Tragedy in Siberia</h2>
<p>A tragic accident occurred at Lake Baikal in Siberia, where a mini-bus carrying Chinese tourists plunged beneath the ice. Divers have recovered the bodies of seven tourists along with a Russian driver who also died in the incident. The event has been a somber moment for both Russian and Chinese communities.</p>
<h2>Environmental Conservation</h2>
<p>In positive environmental news, 158 juvenile giant tortoises have been reintroduced to an island in the Galápagos after the species was driven to extinction there nearly 200 years ago by sailors. This reintroduction marks an important step in restoring the island’s natural ecosystem and reviving a native species long lost to human activity.</p>
<h2>Cultural News</h2>
<p>In the arts, Anna Murdoch-Mann, a writer and former director at News Corp, died at the age of 81 at her home in Florida. She was known for her contributions to journalism and philanthropy. Additionally, the girl group Katseye announced that member Manon will take a temporary hiatus to focus on her health, a decision made collectively by the six-person group after open discussions.</p>
