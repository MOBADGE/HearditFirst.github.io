    <h2>Tensions Rise Between US and Iran</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump has issued a warning to Iran, saying "time is running out" regarding a nuclear deal, as the US military increases its presence in the Gulf region. Trump described the US forces moving toward Iran as a "massive Armada," prompting Tehran to pledge a strong response "like never before" if provoked. These developments heighten concerns of escalating conflict in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside Iran, protesters injured in recent demonstrations are receiving medical care secretly at home to avoid arrest. The government had cut off internet access earlier this month during a crackdown on protests. While internet service is now partly restored, it remains limited and uneven across the country.</p>
<h2>Violence in Ukraine After Drone Strike on Train</h2>
<p>A drone attack in northeastern Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of five people. Three drones targeted a crowded train, causing panic among passengers. Eyewitnesses described the sudden strike and the ensuing chaos on board. The incident marks a deadly episode in ongoing conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>UK Prime Minister Pursues Engagement with China</h2>
<p>The UK prime minister is preparing for a visit to China, aiming to strengthen bilateral ties. He has defended the trip despite facing criticism from opposition figures at home who are wary of closer relations with Beijing. The meeting with China’s leadership highlights the UK’s efforts to balance economic opportunities with geopolitical concerns.</p>
<h2>EU Urged to Boost Defence Capabilities</h2>
<p>The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, has called for urgent action to reduce Europe’s reliance on outside powers for its defence. Her comments came shortly after NATO’s secretary general emphasized Europe's continued dependence on the US for security. Kallas’ remarks underline growing calls within Europe for increased self-sufficiency in defence amid evolving global challenges.</p>
<h2>Amazon Announces Job Cuts Amid Internal Mix-Up</h2>
<p>Technology giant Amazon confirmed plans to eliminate 16,000 jobs following the accidental release of a staff email detailing the cuts. The redundancies are part of a wider reduction in the company's workforce. This announcement adds to concerns about the tech sector’s shifting employment landscape.</p>
<h2>Incident in Minnesota Draws Attention to Immigration Operation</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, tensions have flared after the killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend. Following the incident, Donald Trump said the government plans to "de-escalate" its immigration enforcement actions in the state. The shooting has intensified calls from officials and local communities to reconsider the ongoing immigration operation.</p>
