    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise Over Iran Nuclear Deal</h2>
<p>Former US leader Donald Trump has issued a warning to Iran that "time is running out" to revive the nuclear deal. This comes amid a US military buildup in the Gulf region, signaling increased pressure on Tehran. In response, Iranian authorities stated that their armed forces remain ready and "with their fingers on the trigger" to respond to any aggression. These developments highlight escalating tensions that could further destabilize the region. The outcome of diplomatic efforts and military posturing in the near term will be closely watched internationally.</p>
<h2>Iran Protests and Internet Restrictions</h2>
<p>In Iran, protesters continue to face severe challenges following a government crackdown. Since early January, the country cut off internet access, which is now returning selectively but not for everyone. Meanwhile, wounded demonstrators are avoiding hospitals to escape arrest, instead relying on medics who risk their own safety by treating them in secret at home. These conditions illustrate ongoing unrest and harsh measures by Iranian authorities, raising concerns about human rights and the government’s control over information.</p>
<h2>UK-China Relations Under Debate</h2>
<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is preparing for a visit to China, aiming to strengthen bilateral relations. Despite his optimistic stance about the potential benefits of the trip, he faces strong criticism at home from political opponents wary of deepening ties with Beijing. The visit comes at a sensitive time in global diplomacy, reflecting the UK’s strategic balancing act between economic interests and geopolitical concerns. How these talks unfold may influence future UK foreign policy toward China.</p>
<h2>Violence in Ukraine After Russian Drone Attack</h2>
<p>A Russian drone strike in northeastern Ukraine resulted in the deaths of five people when three drones targeted a crowded train. Survivors described a moment of panic on board as the attack unfolded. This incident is part of ongoing conflict in the region and underscores the human toll and continuing instability caused by drone warfare and broader military actions.</p>
<h2>US Political Incident and Workforce Changes</h2>
<p>In the United States, Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar was sprayed with an unidentified substance while speaking at an event but was unharmed and continued her speech. She described the attack as an attempt by "bullies" to intimidate her. Also, Amazon has confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs following an accidental email that initially leaked the layoffs to staff. These events reflect ongoing political tensions and economic shifts affecting communities and workers.</p>
<h2>European Defence Discussions</h2>
<p>The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, emphasized the urgency for Europe to stop outsourcing its defence capabilities. Her comments follow recent remarks from NATO’s secretary general, who stated Europe remains reliant on the United States for defence. This debate highlights ongoing concerns about European security autonomy and the balance of transatlantic relations amid current global threats. How Europe addresses these defence challenges will shape regional and global security frameworks.</p>
