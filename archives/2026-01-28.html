    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise with US Military Buildup</h2>
<p>Former US presidential candidate Donald Trump warned Iran that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal as the US increases its military presence in the Gulf. Iran responded by stating its armed forces remain ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to react to any aggression. This escalation reflects ongoing heightened tensions in the region, which could impact diplomatic negotiations and regional security in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Iran Protests and Internet Restrictions</h2>
<p>In Iran, widespread protests continue amid a government crackdown. Many wounded demonstrators are avoiding hospitals to prevent arrests, instead receiving medical treatment discreetly at home from medics risking their own safety. Meanwhile, Iran’s government is gradually restoring internet access after it was cut off on 8 January, but the restoration is limited and not available to everyone. These developments highlight the ongoing social unrest and the government’s tight control over communication channels.</p>
<h2>Violence in Ukraine: Drone Attack on Train</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, a passenger described the panic experienced during a drone strike on a crowded train that killed five people. The attack is a part of the broader conflict affecting civilians and infrastructure, underscoring the dangers faced by ordinary people trying to travel safely amid ongoing hostilities.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters: Fatal Storm in Portugal and Plane Crash in Colombia</h2>
<p>Storm Kristin has caused severe damage in Portugal, leading to at least five deaths. The storm toppled trees, damaged homes, and resulted in power outages affecting more than 800,000 people. Meanwhile, in Colombia, a plane from state airline Satena carrying 13 passengers and two crew members crashed, killing all on board. These tragic events highlight challenges in public safety and emergency response during both natural and transportation-related disasters.</p>
<h2>Europe’s Defence Concerns and Financial Investigation in Germany</h2>
<p>The EU’s foreign policy chief urged Europe to act urgently to stop relying on other countries for its defense capabilities. This statement came shortly after NATO’s secretary general emphasized Europe’s dependence on the United States for defense. This call for increased European self-reliance may influence future defense policies and investments.</p>
<p>In Germany, officials raided Deutsche Bank offices in Frankfurt and Berlin as part of an investigation into past business relationships related to money laundering. This probe highlights ongoing efforts by authorities to address financial crimes within major institutions.</p>
<h2>US Political Incident and Corporate Job Cuts</h2>
<p>In the US, congresswoman Ilhan Omar from Minnesota was sprayed with an unidentified liquid at a public event but was uninjured and continued her remarks. She described the incident as a fight against bullying.</p>
<p>Separately, Amazon confirmed it will cut approximately 16,000 jobs. The announcement followed an accidental email sent to staff that revealed the layoffs prematurely. This move reflects continued shifts in the technology sector’s workforce amid broader economic pressures.</p>
