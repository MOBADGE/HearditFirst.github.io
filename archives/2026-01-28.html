    <h2>US Immigration and Politics in Minnesota</h2>
<p>Following the killing of Alex Pretti during an immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, former US president Donald Trump said the government would "de-escalate" its activities in the state. The incident has led to renewed calls from Minnesota officials and residents urging Trump to end his immigration operation there. Meanwhile, some Republican lawmakers are questioning the aggressive federal crackdown due to growing public anger after two citizens were killed by federal agents in the area. These developments highlight increasing tensions around immigration enforcement and the political debate within the Republican Party.</p>
<h2>Attack on Minnesota Congresswoman</h2>
<p>Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar was attacked with an unknown liquid at a public event but was uninjured and continued her speech. Details about the assailant or motivation have not been disclosed. The incident adds to concerns about the safety of public officials and political tensions in Minnesota amid the recent controversies over immigration enforcement and local unrest.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Violence in Ukraine and Iran</h2>
<p>In northeastern Ukraine, a Russian drone strike targeted a crowded passenger train, killing five people. Ukrainian officials have condemned the attack, which is part of ongoing violence in the region. Separately, young protesters in Iran recounted to the BBC how security forces violently suppressed protests earlier this month, resulting in multiple deaths among their friends and acquaintances. These events reflect continuing instability and human suffering in parts of Eastern Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments in Asia</h2>
<p>South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, has been sentenced to 20 months in prison for bribery. She was also ordered to return a valuable diamond necklace and repay over 12 million won in cash. In Malaysia, top football officials resigned after Fifa accused the national football association of falsifying citizenship documents for foreign-born players. Additionally, Mexico's president requested more concerts from the South Korean pop group BTS, where demand had far outpaced ticket availability. These varied stories show legal accountability and cultural exchanges shaping the region.</p>
<h2>International Disputes and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Rwanda is seeking £100 million from the UK over a canceled asylum agreement, arguing that payments are owed. The British Home Office has stated it will contest the claim. In other international news, former US president Donald Trump warned that the US would "no longer help Iraq" if the country appoints Maliki as its prime minister, stating Iraq would have "zero" chance of success without American support. These developments emphasize ongoing diplomatic and financial tensions among nations.</p>
