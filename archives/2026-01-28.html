    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 28, 2026</div>
    <h2>Middle East Tensions Escalate</h2>
<p>Former US President Donald Trump has warned that Iran's window for reaching a nuclear deal is closing, amid a growing US military presence in the Gulf. In response, Tehran declared that its armed forces remain on high alert, ready to react swiftly to any aggression. These developments highlight the fragile state of diplomacy in the region and suggest heightened risks of conflict if a resolution is not found soon.</p>
<h2>Iran Protests and Internet Restrictions</h2>
<p>In Iran, ongoing protests continue despite a government crackdown. Many injured demonstrators are seeking medical help in secret, relying on medics who treat them covertly at their homes to avoid arrest. Meanwhile, internet access, which was cut off nationwide in early January to limit protest coordination, is slowly being restored—but not for everyone. The limited connectivity may affect the flow of information and the ability of protesters and the public to communicate freely.</p>
<h2>Rising Concern in Europe About Defence</h2>
<p>The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has urged Europe to stop relying heavily on external powers for its defence. His remarks follow comments from NATO’s Secretary General that Europe still depends on the United States for its security. This exchange reflects ongoing debates about Europe's strategic autonomy and the future of transatlantic defence cooperation.</p>
<h2>Violence in Ukraine</h2>
<p>A recent Russian drone strike targeted a crowded train in Ukraine, killing five people. Passengers described the panic and chaos during the attack. Such incidents underscore the ongoing dangers faced by civilians amid the conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing the human cost of military confrontations in the region.</p>
<h2>Political and Corporate Developments</h2>
<p>In the US, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was sprayed with an unidentified liquid at a public event but remained unharmed and continued speaking, stating, "I don't let bullies win." The incident adds to concerns about political safety and civility.</p>
<p>In the business world, Deutsche Bank is under investigation for money laundering, with police raids conducted at its offices in Frankfurt and Berlin linked to past business relationships. Meanwhile, Amazon confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs following an accidental internal email revealing the layoffs. These events reflect ongoing challenges in both the financial and technology sectors.</p>
<h2>UK-China Relations</h2>
<p>The UK Prime Minister is preparing for a visit to China, aiming to strengthen bilateral ties despite criticism from political opponents at home. The trip comes as global diplomacy navigates complex issues involving economic cooperation and geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic Incident in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Ecuador has filed a complaint after a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent attempted to enter its consulate in Minneapolis without permission. Consular staff stopped the agent, signaling heightened sensitivity around diplomatic premises and the protection of foreign missions on US soil.</p>
