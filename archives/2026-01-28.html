    <h2>US Immigration Tensions in Minnesota</h2>
<p>The killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota over the weekend has intensified debates about the government's immigration enforcement efforts in the state. Following the incident, Minnesota officials and local residents have renewed calls for the federal immigration operation, led by Donald Trump, to be ended. Trump responded by saying the government would "de-escalate" the situation in Minnesota. At the same time, rising public anger has prompted some Republican lawmakers to question the crackdown by federal agents, particularly after two citizens were killed, though they have generally avoided directly criticizing Trump.</p>
<h2>Attack on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar</h2>
<p>Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was attacked with an unknown liquid during a town hall event. Despite the incident, Omar was uninjured and continued her speech at the event. Authorities are investigating the attack, but no further details about the substance or the assailant have been disclosed.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments in South Korea</h2>
<p>Kim Keon Hee, South Korea's former first lady, has been sentenced to 20 months in jail following a bribery conviction. She was also ordered to return a Graff diamond necklace and repay 12.85 million won in cash. The case involved allegations that Kim accepted luxury handbags, the diamond necklace, and other gifts as bribes. This outcome sheds light on ongoing concerns about corruption involving high-profile figures in South Korea.</p>
<h2>Iran Protesters Describe Brutal Crackdown</h2>
<p>In Iran, young protesters have shared their firsthand accounts with the BBC about a recent, harsh crackdown by security forces. Many described witnessing the deaths of friends and others during the government's efforts to suppress demonstrations earlier this month. These personal stories highlight the human cost behind the continuing unrest in the country.</p>
<h2>Cultural Demand in Mexico and Greenlander Support</h2>
<p>In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has appealed to South Korea for additional concerts by the K-pop group BTS, following the rapid sell-out of 150,000 tickets in under 40 minutes amid about one million fans trying to buy them. Meanwhile, musician Neil Young has offered Greenlanders free access to his archives. He expressed hope that this gesture would help alleviate some of the "unwarranted stress and threats" faced by Greenlanders amid concerns linked to Trump’s threats involving the territory.</p>
<h2>US-Iraq Relations Face Strain</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has warned that the US will "no longer help Iraq" if it appoints Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister. Trump stated that Iraq would have "zero" chance of success without American support, signaling potential shifts in US foreign policy toward Iraq depending on its political decisions.</p>
<h2>Canada-US Trade Talks</h2>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Carney denied that he had softened his stance from a recent speech in Davos during a phone call with Trump. He also remarked that "there's almost nothing normal in the US" during discussions about trade talks, suggesting ongoing challenges in navigating the bilateral economic relationship.</p>
