    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise Over Iran Nuclear Deal</h2>
<p>Former US leader Donald Trump warned that "time is running out" for reaching a nuclear deal with Iran. This warning comes amid a US military buildup in the Gulf region. Tehran has responded by expressing its readiness for dialogue with the United States but cautioned it would “respond like never before” if provoked. The situation highlights ongoing tensions over Iran's nuclear program and the potential for increased conflict if diplomatic efforts stall.</p>
<h2>US Political Incident in Minnesota</h2>
<p>Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Democrat, was attacked at a public event when someone sprayed her with an unidentified liquid. She was unharmed and continued speaking, emphasizing her unwillingness to "let bullies win." This incident comes during heightened political tensions and calls attention to the security concerns for public officials.</p>
<h2>UK Prime Minister Visits China Amid Criticism</h2>
<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Beijing aiming to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties between the UK and China. Despite the potential benefits of improved relations, Starmer faces strong criticism from opposition groups at home, signaling ongoing domestic debate over the direction of UK-China policies. The trip could impact trade and geopolitical dynamics in the coming months.</p>
<h2>European Defence Calls for Greater Autonomy</h2>
<p>The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, urged European countries to stop relying heavily on outsourcing their defence needs. Kallas's remarks followed recent comments from NATO's secretary general who said Europe needs the United States for its defence. This reflects a growing conversation in Europe about increasing self-reliance in military matters and the future balance of transatlantic security cooperation.</p>
<h2>Amazon Announces Significant Job Cuts</h2>
<p>Amazon confirmed it will reduce its workforce by 16,000 jobs, a decision that was initially revealed through an accidental email sent to staff. This major reduction reflects continued changes in the technology sector and impacts a large number of employees. The cuts come amid broader economic shifts in tech companies and highlight ongoing adjustments in the industry.</p>
<h2>Tragic Ice Accidents in the United States</h2>
<p>A family tragedy unfolded in the US as a mother lost her three sons after they fell through ice on a pond. Despite her efforts to save them by lifting them out, the ice repeatedly broke, making rescue impossible. This heartbreaking incident raises awareness about the dangers of winter conditions and ice safety, particularly for children.</p>
