    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise</h2>
<p>Former US leader Donald Trump has warned that Iran's time to renegotiate the nuclear deal is running out, amid a US military buildup in the Gulf region. Iran’s armed forces have responded by stating they are prepared to respond swiftly, with their "fingers on the trigger," if they face any aggression. This escalation comes at a delicate moment, with the potential to increase regional instability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside Iran, protesters injured during ongoing demonstrations are avoiding hospitals due to fear of arrest. Many are relying on underground medics who provide emergency treatment in private homes. Internet access in Iran is slowly being restored after a shutdown that began in early January during the government crackdown on protests; however, connectivity remains limited and uneven across the country.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Drone Attack on Passenger Train</h2>
<p>A passenger described the chaos after a Russian drone strike targeted a crowded train in Ukraine, killing five people. The attack highlights the ongoing dangers faced by civilians in the conflict zone as both sides continue to engage in military operations. Such incidents underline the human cost of the conflict and the challenges for safe civilian transportation.</p>
<h2>UK-China Relations Under Scrutiny</h2>
<p>The UK prime minister is visiting China to seek improved bilateral relations, aiming to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties. However, this trip has attracted sharp criticism from political opponents who question the approach amid concerns over China's global policies and human rights record. The meeting with China's leader will be closely watched for indications of how the UK plans to balance cooperation and caution.</p>
<h2>Weather Disasters Hit Colombia and Portugal</h2>
<p>A devastating plane crash in Colombia claimed the lives of all 15 people onboard, including 13 passengers and two crew members. The state airline Satena confirmed the fatal accident but details remain limited as investigations continue.</p>
<p>In Portugal, Storm Kristin caused widespread damage, toppling trees, damaging homes, and causing power outages for more than 800,000 people. At least five deaths have been reported. The storm stresses the importance of preparedness and resilient infrastructure amid increasingly severe weather events.</p>
<h2>Europe’s Defense Debate and Financial Investigation</h2>
<p>The European Union’s foreign policy chief called for urgent action to reduce Europe’s reliance on external partners for defense, following remarks by NATO’s secretary general emphasizing the continent’s dependency on the US. This discussion reflects ongoing concerns about Europe's strategic autonomy and security.</p>
<p>In Germany, Deutsche Bank faced raids at its Frankfurt and Berlin offices in connection with a money laundering investigation related to past business activities. The searches indicate increasing scrutiny on financial institutions and the enforcement of anti-money laundering regulations.</p>
<h2>US Congresswoman Targeted but Uninjured</h2>
<p>In the United States, Representative Ilhan Omar was sprayed with an unidentified liquid at a public event but remained unharmed. She continued speaking, affirming her stance against intimidation. The incident underscores heightened tensions in political discourse and the importance of maintaining safety during public engagements.</p>
