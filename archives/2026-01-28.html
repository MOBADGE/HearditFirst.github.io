    <h2>US Immigration Enforcement in Minnesota</h2>
<p>Following the killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend, Minnesota officials and local residents have intensified calls for the end of a federal immigration crackdown in the state. In response, Donald Trump said the government would "de-escalate" its enforcement operation in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have criticized the immigration actions but have mostly avoided directly attacking Trump. The criticism grew especially after two American citizens were killed by federal agents during the crackdown, raising questions about the approach and its consequences.</p>
<h2>Attack on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar</h2>
<p>Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was targeted during a town hall event when an unidentified liquid was thrown at her. Fortunately, she was uninjured and continued to speak at the event. The incident has further highlighted the tense and sometimes hostile political climate around immigration issues and public appearances by elected officials in Minnesota.</p>
<h2>Tensions in Iraq Over Prime Minister Selection</h2>
<p>Donald Trump also issued a warning related to Iraq's political future. He stated that the United States would "no longer help" Iraq if it chooses Nuri al-Maliki as its next prime minister. Trump asserted that Iraq would have "zero" chance of success without American support, indicating a firm stance on the country's leadership choices and signaling potential changes in US foreign policy engagement.</p>
<h2>Protests and Crackdown in Iran</h2>
<p>In Iran, young protesters shared with the BBC their experiences of a brutal government crackdown on recent demonstrations. Many spoke about witnessing friends and acquaintances killed as security forces suppressed the unrest earlier this month. The accounts paint a grim picture of the ongoing human rights situation in Iran and the serious consequences for those involved in the protests.</p>
<h2>Cultural Highlights: BTS Concert and Neil Young’s Offer</h2>
<p>On a lighter note, Mexico’s president requested that South Korea arrange more concerts by the popular band BTS after tickets for their latest show sold out in less than 40 minutes, with about a million fans competing for just 150,000 tickets. Meanwhile, musician Neil Young offered Greenlanders free access to his archives. This gesture aims to help reduce stress and threats that the people of Greenland feel amid Donald Trump’s threats directed at the territory.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Stories</h2>
<p>In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Carney denied that he walked back comments made in his Davos speech during a phone call with Trump. He described the situation with the US as “almost nothing normal,” reflecting ongoing challenges in trade talks. In South Korea, former first lady Kim faces accusations of accepting luxury goods as bribes, including handbags and jewelry, which has drawn public and media attention. Additionally, Abena Christine Jon’el, a Ghanaian resident, uses her prosthetic leg as a symbol of her patriotism and works to raise awareness about people living with disabilities.</p>
