    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise Over Iran Nuclear Deal</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has issued a warning to Iran that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal as the US military increases its presence in the Gulf. Trump described the US deployment as a "massive Armada" moving toward Iran, prompting a strong reaction from Tehran. Iranian officials stated they would “respond like never before” if necessary, signaling heightened tensions that could affect regional stability and international negotiations about Iran’s nuclear program.</p>
<h2>UK-China Relations in Focus Ahead of Xi Meeting</h2>
<p>The UK prime minister is preparing to visit China with hopes of strengthening economic and diplomatic ties. Despite the planned engagement, the visit faces significant criticism from domestic opponents concerned about the potential implications of closer relations with Beijing. The outcome of this meeting may influence trade agreements and future cooperation but remains controversial within the UK political landscape.</p>
<h2>Ukrainian Passenger Train Targeted by Drone Strike</h2>
<p>A drone attack on a crowded passenger train in northeastern Ukraine has resulted in five fatalities. The strike involved three drones targeting the train, causing panic among passengers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack. This incident highlights the ongoing conflict in the region and the risks faced by civilians in contested areas.</p>
<h2>European Defence and Security Debates</h2>
<p>The European Union’s foreign policy chief emphasized the urgent need to stop outsourcing the continent’s defence capabilities. The remarks come shortly after NATO’s secretary general remarked that Europe still relies heavily on the United States for its defence needs. This ongoing debate may influence future EU defence policies and efforts toward greater military autonomy.</p>
<h2>Amazon Confirms Large-Scale Job Cuts</h2>
<p>Amazon has officially confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs, following an accidental email sent to staff earlier that revealed the planned redundancies. The company has faced economic pressures leading to this substantial workforce reduction, reflecting broader challenges in the technology sector and impacting thousands of employees globally.</p>
<h2>Notable Incidents in the United States</h2>
<p>Several incidents caught attention domestically in the US. Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was sprayed with an unknown liquid while speaking at an event but remained unharmed and continued her remarks, condemning the act and asserting resilience against intimidation. In a separate matter, former President Trump stated his government would "de-escalate" immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota following renewed calls for change after the killing of Alex Pretti. Additionally, Ecuador has filed a complaint after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent tried to enter its consulate in Minneapolis, where consular staff blocked the attempt. These events highlight ongoing political and social tensions within the US.</p>
