    <h2>U.S. Immigration and Local Responses in Minnesota</h2>
<p>Following the weekend killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, there has been renewed public criticism of the federal immigration enforcement operation led by Donald Trump in the state. Trump stated that the government would "de-escalate" its activities there. Meanwhile, some Republican lawmakers are rethinking the approach to immigration enforcement following the deaths of two citizens linked to federal agents, as public anger grows. The debate highlights tensions between enforcing immigration laws and addressing community concerns about safety and civil rights.</p>
<h2>Attack on U.S. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar</h2>
<p>Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar faced an attack during a public event when she was sprayed with an unidentified liquid. Omar was not injured and continued speaking despite the incident. She responded defiantly, stating, "I don't let bullies win," underscoring her determination to remain active and engaged in her work. The event raises concerns about the rising aggression faced by public officials.</p>
<h2>Ukraine: Deadly Russian Drone Strike on Passenger Train</h2>
<p>A drone attack in northeastern Ukraine struck a crowded passenger train, killing five people. Ukrainian officials condemned the strike, which involved Russian drones targeting civilian transportation. This event is part of ongoing conflict dynamics in the region and further illustrates the dangers faced by non-combatants in the war.</p>
<h2>Judiciary and Political Corruption in South Korea</h2>
<p>Kim Keon Hee, South Korea’s former first lady, has been sentenced to 20 months in jail on bribery charges. She was also ordered to return a valuable Graff diamond necklace and repay approximately 12.85 million won in cash. The case reflects continued scrutiny of political figures and issues of corruption in the country.</p>
<h2>Rwanda's Legal Dispute Over Asylum Deal with the UK</h2>
<p>Rwanda is seeking £100 million from the UK, claiming it is owed payments related to a cancelled asylum agreement. However, the UK Home Office has stated it will contest the claim. This dispute is part of broader diplomatic and legal discussions on asylum policies and international agreements between countries.</p>
