    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump has warned that Iran’s time to negotiate a nuclear deal is running out amid increasing military activity in the Gulf region. In response, Tehran has declared that its armed forces are prepared to respond firmly to any aggression, stating they are “with their fingers on the trigger.” This escalation underscores rising tensions between the US and Iran, where diplomatic solutions remain uncertain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Iran, wounded protesters have reported that to avoid arrest, they are being treated secretly by medics in their homes rather than in hospitals. This is part of a broader government crackdown on demonstrations. Internet access, which was cut off in early January, is now returning but not uniformly across the country, adding further complications to communication and public safety in the region.</p>
<h2>Conflict Impact on Civilians in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck a crowded train in Ukraine when it was targeted by a Russian drone strike, resulting in the deaths of five people. A passenger who survived described the panic that ensued. This event highlights the ongoing risks civilians face in areas affected by the conflict and the challenges in protecting non-combatants during hostilities.</p>
<h2>UK-China Relations and Domestic Debate</h2>
<p>The UK prime minister is preparing for a visit to China with the aim of strengthening bilateral ties. However, this move has drawn strong criticism from political opponents within the UK, reflecting a broader debate about how to engage with China amid global geopolitical tensions. The visit is significant as it may influence future trade, diplomacy, and strategic relations between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Severe Weather Hits Portugal</h2>
<p>Storm Kristin has caused significant damage in Portugal, leading to the deaths of at least five people. The storm toppled trees, damaged homes, and left over 800,000 people without power. The impact demonstrates the ongoing challenge European countries face in managing extreme weather events and underscores the importance of emergency preparedness and infrastructure resilience.</p>
<h2>Investigations and Incidents in Europe and the US</h2>
<p>German authorities raided Deutsche Bank offices in Frankfurt and Berlin as part of a money laundering investigation related to past business dealings. The probe could have implications for the bank’s operations and regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>In the United States, Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar was targeted at a public event when someone sprayed her with an unidentified liquid. She was uninjured and continued speaking, stating, “I don’t let bullies win.” The incident adds to concerns about the safety of public officials and the climate of political hostility.</p>
<h2>Tragic Plane Crash in Colombia</h2>
<p>A plane operated by state airline Satena crashed in Colombia, killing all 15 people onboard, including 13 passengers and two crew members. The accident is under investigation, and it highlights ongoing challenges in aviation safety in the region.</p>
