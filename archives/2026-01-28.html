    <h2>International Tensions and Military Movements</h2>
<p>The US president issued a warning to Iran that "time is running out" as the US military is increasing its presence in the Gulf region. The president mentioned sending a "massive Armada" to the area and has previously promised to support protesters in Iran. This buildup signals escalating tensions between the two countries, which could impact regional stability in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Ukraine, President Zelensky condemned a Russian drone strike that targeted a busy passenger train in the northeast. The attack resulted in the deaths of five people, underscoring the ongoing conflict and its toll on civilians.</p>
<h2>Domestic Incidents and Political Events in the US</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, the killing of Alex Pretti reignited discussions about immigration enforcement. The US president responded by stating that the government would "de-escalate" operations in the state. This comes amid calls from local officials and residents to halt immigration activities following the tragedy.</p>
<p>Separately, US congresswoman Ilhan Omar was attacked during a public event when an unidentified liquid was thrown at her. She was uninjured and continued her speech, emphasizing that she does not allow bullies to prevail.</p>
<h2>Corporate News</h2>
<p>Amazon confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs after an accidental email to staff revealed the redundancies prematurely. This large-scale job reduction highlights ongoing challenges in the technology sector and may affect thousands of employees worldwide.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments Abroad</h2>
<p>In South Korea, Kim Keon Hee, the former first lady, was sentenced to 20 months in jail for bribery. She was also ordered to return a valuable diamond necklace and repay over 12 million won in cash, marking a significant legal consequence in the country's political landscape.</p>
<p>Ecuador has filed a complaint after a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent attempted to enter its consulate in Minneapolis, only to be stopped by consular staff. This incident could affect diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Disputes</h2>
<p>A veteran Indian politician, Ajit Pawar, died in a plane crash along with four others in Maharashtra state. The accident is a loss for the region and may have political repercussions.</p>
<p>In the UK-Rwanda asylum policy dispute, Rwanda is seeking £100 million in payments from the UK after an asylum deal was canceled. The UK Home Office has stated it will contest the claim, indicating a potential legal battle over the agreement's termination.</p>
<p>Lastly, a heartbreaking incident in the US saw a mother lose three sons after they fell through a frozen pond. She attempted to rescue them despite the dangerous ice conditions, but tragically, all three boys died.
