    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise Over Iran Nuclear Deal</h2>
<p>Former US leader Donald Trump has issued a warning to Iran, saying "time is running out" to revive the nuclear deal. This comes amid a growing US military presence in the Gulf region. Iran’s armed forces have responded by stating they are prepared to act and have their "fingers on the trigger" against any aggression. The situation remains tense, with the possibility of escalating conflict if diplomatic efforts do not succeed.</p>
<h2>Iran Protesters Receive Medical Care in Secret</h2>
<p>Following government crackdowns, wounded protesters in Iran are avoiding hospitals due to fear of arrest. Instead, they are being treated privately by medics willing to put their own safety at risk. Internet access, which was cut off in early January amid attempts to suppress protests, is gradually being restored but not fully available to everyone. These developments highlight ongoing unrest and the challenges facing those involved in the protests.</p>
<h2>UK-China Relations Under Scrutiny Ahead of Leadership Meeting</h2>
<p>The UK prime minister plans to visit China in an effort to strengthen bilateral ties. This trip comes despite sharp criticism from political opponents within the UK, who question the benefits of closer relations with China. The upcoming meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping aims to address economic and diplomatic issues, signaling a pivotal moment in UK foreign policy.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Train Targeted in Drone Strike</h2>
<p>A passenger on a crowded train in Ukraine described the chaos after it was struck by Russian drones, resulting in the deaths of five people. The attack underscores the continued conflict and risks faced by civilians in the region. Eyewitness accounts bring a human perspective to the ongoing violence and disruption caused by the conflict.</p>
<h2>Europe Faces Calls for Greater Defence Independence</h2>
<p>The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has urged Europe to stop relying so heavily on other countries for its defence needs. His comments follow statements from NATO’s secretary general emphasizing Europe's dependence on the United States for security. This debate highlights a critical question about Europe’s strategic autonomy and future defence policies.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Political Incidents in US and Europe</h2>
<p>Amazon confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs after an accidental email revealed the redundancies prematurely. The company aims to restructure amid changing market conditions. In Germany, Deutsche Bank offices in Frankfurt and Berlin were raided as part of an investigation into past money laundering allegations. Meanwhile, US congresswoman Ilhan Omar faced an attack when an unidentified liquid was thrown at her during a public event. She was unharmed and stated her resolve not to let "bullies win," continuing her remarks despite the incident.</p>
