    <h2>United States: Tensions in Minnesota and Political Incidents</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in Minnesota after the killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend. Local officials and community members have renewed calls for Donald Trump to stop his immigration enforcement operation there. Trump responded by saying the government will work to "de-escalate" the situation in the state.</p>
<p>In a related development, U.S. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, was targeted during a public event when an unknown liquid was sprayed at her. She was unharmed and continued her speech, stating, "I don't let bullies win."</p>
<p>Additionally, Ecuador has filed a complaint after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent tried to enter its consulate in Minneapolis without permission. Consular staff prevented the agent from entering, escalating diplomatic concerns.</p>
<h2>International Justice and Diplomatic Issues</h2>
<p>In South Korea, Kim Keon Hee, the country's former first lady, has been sentenced to 20 months in prison for bribery. She was also ordered to return a valuable Graff diamond necklace and repay 12.85 million won in cash.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rwanda is seeking £100 million from the United Kingdom after a plan for asylum cooperation between the two countries was canceled. The UK Home Office has stated it intends to challenge the claim.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Conflicts Around the World</h2>
<p>A plane crash in India's Maharashtra state claimed the life of veteran politician Ajit Pawar and four others. The crash is a significant loss for the region, though details about the cause remain limited.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, a Russian drone strike hit a crowded passenger train in the northeast, killing five people. Ukrainian officials condemned the attack, highlighting ongoing violence linked to the conflict in the region.</p>
<p>In Iran, reports from protesters speak of a brutal crackdown by security forces who violently suppressed demonstrations earlier this month. Young Iranians recounted witnessing deaths among their friends and neighbors, underscoring the severe human toll of the unrest.</p>
<h2>Human Interest: Personal Loss and Economic Changes</h2>
<p>A US mother shared a heartbreaking story after three of her sons died in a tragic accident when they fell through pond ice. Despite her efforts to save them, the ice broke repeatedly, preventing her rescue attempts.</p>
<p>On the economic front, Amazon has confirmed plans to cut around 16,000 jobs. This announcement followed an accidental internal email to employees that revealed the scale of redundancies before the company officially confirmed the layoffs. The move reflects ongoing challenges in the technology and retail sectors.</p>
