    <h2>U.S. Immigration Operations in Minnesota Under Scrutiny</h2>
<p>The killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota has led to renewed calls from local officials and residents for President Trump to end his administration's immigration enforcement operation in the state. Trump responded by saying the government will “de-escalate” its activities there. Meanwhile, some Republican lawmakers have criticized the immigration crackdown but have avoided direct attacks on Trump amid growing public anger over the deaths of two citizens linked to federal agents’ actions. The situation highlights rising tensions over immigration enforcement tactics and their impact on local communities.</p>
<h2>Attack on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar at Town Hall</h2>
<p>Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was attacked with an unknown liquid during a recent town hall meeting. Omar was not injured and continued her speech despite the incident. No further details were provided about the attacker or motives. This event adds to concerns about safety and security for public officials amid contentious political climates.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Faces Deadly Drone Strike on Passenger Train</h2>
<p>Ukrainian officials reported that Russian drones struck a crowded passenger train in the northeast of the country, killing five people. The attack on civilian transportation underscores ongoing violence and instability in Ukraine amid the conflict with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the drone strike, highlighting the humanitarian toll of the conflict as fighting continues.</p>
<h2>Former South Korean First Lady Sentenced for Bribery</h2>
<p>Kim Keon Hee, the former first lady of South Korea, has been sentenced to 20 months in jail on bribery charges. She was also ordered to return a Graff diamond necklace and repay 12.85 million won ($10,600) in cash. The case is part of broader scrutiny around corruption and misconduct among top figures in South Korea.</p>
<h2>Protests and Crackdown in Iran</h2>
<p>Young Iranians spoke to the BBC about witnessing friends and community members killed during a brutal crackdown on protests earlier this month. The testimonies reflect widespread grief and trauma as security forces suppressed demonstrations, illustrating the severe human cost of ongoing unrest in Iran.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Diplomatic Notes: BTS Concert Demand and Neil Young’s Offer</h2>
<p>In Mexico, approximately one million fans competed for just 150,000 tickets to a BTS concert, which sold out in less than 40 minutes. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has since asked South Korea to hold more BTS concerts to meet fan demand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, musician Neil Young offered free access to his archives for Greenlanders. This gesture came amidst worries in Greenland about threats from Donald Trump regarding the territory. Young said he hoped the offer would help reduce stress felt by Greenlanders.</p>
<h2>U.S.-Iraq Relations and Canadian-U.S. Trade Comments</h2>
<p>President Trump stated that the U.S. will “no longer help Iraq” if the country chooses Nuri al-Maliki as prime minister, warning Iraq would have “zero” chance of success without American support. This stance points to ongoing U.S. influence and strategic interests in Iraq.</p>
<p>In a separate diplomatic note, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Carney denied reports he had walked back remarks made at the World Economic Forum in Davos during a phone call with Trump. Carney also commented on the state of Canada-U.S. trade talks, noting, “there’s almost nothing normal in the US,” suggesting challenges ahead in negotiations.</p>
