    <div class="date">January 28, 2026</div>
    <h2>U.S. Political and Social Updates</h2>
<p>The killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota has intensified calls from local officials and residents for the end of an immigration enforcement operation led by Donald Trump in the state. In response, Trump said the government will "de-escalate" its activities there. Additionally, Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was sprayed with an unidentified liquid at an event but was uninjured and continued speaking. She described the incident as a stand against bullying.</p>
<h2>International Incidents and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Ecuador has filed a complaint after an ICE agent attempted to enter its consulate in Minneapolis but was prevented by consular staff. Meanwhile, in South Korea, Kim Keon Hee was sentenced to 20 months in jail on bribery charges. She was also ordered to return a valuable diamond necklace and repay around 12.85 million won in cash.</p>
<h2>Global Conflict and Tragedy</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, officials reported that a Russian drone strike targeted a crowded passenger train in the northeast, killing five people. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack. In India, veteran politician Ajit Pawar died along with four others in a plane crash in Maharashtra. In Texas, three brothers died after falling through the ice on a frozen pond; their mother attempted to rescue them but the ice broke repeatedly.</p>
<h2>Economic and Diplomatic Matters</h2>
<p>Amazon confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs, following an accidental internal email to staff that revealed the layoffs prematurely. On the diplomatic front, Rwanda is seeking £100 million from the UK related to a cancelled asylum deal. The UK Home Office has stated it will contest the claim.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Iran</h2>
<p>Young protesters in Iran have spoken to reporters about witnessing friends and others killed during a recent government crackdown on demonstrations. They described the violence and losses as part of a brutal response by security forces earlier this month. This account draws attention to ongoing unrest and human rights issues in the country.</p>
