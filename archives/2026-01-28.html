    <h2>Middle East Tensions Rise as US Military Builds Up in Gulf</h2>
<p>Former US leader Donald Trump has issued a warning to Iran, saying that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal. This comes as the US military increases its presence in the Gulf region amid ongoing tensions. In response, Tehran stated its armed forces are prepared to respond strongly if attacked, with soldiers "ready with their fingers on the trigger." These developments highlight a period of heightened uncertainty in diplomacy and security in a strategically important area.</p>
<h2>Continued Protests and Crackdown in Iran</h2>
<p>Protesters in Iran are facing harsh government repression. Many injured demonstrators are avoiding hospitals for fear of being arrested and instead are receiving medical treatment secretly at home, provided by medics willing to take risks. Meanwhile, Iran's internet service, which had been cut off since early January amid the crackdown, is gradually being restored but not for everyone. This partial restoration limits communication amid ongoing unrest.</p>
<h2>UK-China Relations Under Scrutiny Ahead of Visit</h2>
<p>The UK prime minister is preparing for a trip to China, aiming to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties. This visit is seen as an opportunity for benefits in trade and cooperation. However, the prime minister faces significant criticism at home from political opponents concerned about the nature and timing of engagement with China. The trip will be closely watched as global powers navigate complex relationships.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine: Drone Strike Hits Passenger Train</h2>
<p>A passenger described a panic on a crowded train in Ukraine following a Russian drone strike that killed five people. The attack on civilian infrastructure adds to the human toll of the ongoing conflict in the region and underscores the dangers faced by ordinary people caught in hostilities. The incident remains a stark example of the war's impact beyond the front lines.</p>
<h2>Political Unrest in the US and Job Cuts in Tech Sector</h2>
<p>In Minnesota, US congresswoman Ilhan Omar was targeted when an unidentified liquid was thrown at her during a public event. Uninjured, she vowed not to be intimidated by such acts. The incident came amid local calls for ending a controversial immigration operation after a recent fatal shooting involving community members.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs, confirming mass layoffs initially revealed by an email sent to staff by mistake. This marks a significant shift as the tech giant adjusts its workforce amid economic pressures. These events reflect ongoing political and economic challenges in the United States.</p>
<h2>EU Leaders Call for Stronger Defence Independence</h2>
<p>The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, emphasized the urgent need for Europe to stop relying heavily on other countries for its defence. Her remarks came shortly after NATO’s secretary general stated that Europe still depends on the United States for military security. This debate about Europe’s defence strategy is central to ongoing discussions about the continent’s readiness and sovereignty in a changing geopolitical landscape.</p>
