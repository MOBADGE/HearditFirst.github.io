    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 28, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions in the Gulf region are rising as former US President Trump issued a warning to Iran, saying that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal. Meanwhile, the US military is increasing its presence in the Gulf. Iran stated it is open to dialogue with the US but warned it would “respond like never before” if necessary. This standoff highlights the ongoing uncertainty in diplomatic efforts to manage nuclear proliferation in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In Europe, the EU’s foreign policy chief urged urgent action to stop outsourcing defense, emphasizing the need for greater European self-reliance. This call follows comments from NATO’s secretary general, who said Europe still depends heavily on the US for its defense. The evolving security dynamics underscore Europe's desire to strengthen its defense capabilities amid global tensions.</p>
<h2>Domestic Politics and Security in the US</h2>
<p>Minnesota has been the focus of recent unrest following the shooting of Alex Pretti. In response, Trump said the government would "de-escalate" its immigration operation in the state. These remarks come amidst renewed calls from local officials and communities to end the immigration enforcement actions, which have been a source of controversy.</p>
<p>Separately, Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar was sprayed with an unidentified liquid at an event but was uninjured and continued speaking. Omar stated, “I don't let bullies win,” reflecting her resilience in the face of the attack, which underscores ongoing political tensions within the US.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime News</h2>
<p>A man has been found guilty of assault after Barron Trump, son of Donald Trump, reported witnessing the attack during a video call in January 2025. This unusual circumstance of reporting highlights the varied ways law enforcement is adapting to modern communication technology in handling crimes.</p>
<p>In South Korea, the country's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, was sentenced to 20 months in jail for bribery. She was also ordered to return a Graff diamond necklace and repay approximately 12.85 million won. The sentence reflects ongoing efforts in South Korea to address corruption at high levels.</p>
<h2>Trade and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is on a visit to China, aiming to strengthen ties between the two countries. Despite facing strong criticism from political opponents at home, Starmer insisted the trip would bring benefits to the UK. With tensions often high in UK-China relations, this engagement may signal a strategic effort to advance economic and diplomatic interests.</p>
<h2>Corporate Developments</h2>
<p>Amazon confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs, a message that reached staff through an accidentally sent email. This significant reduction signals ongoing adjustments within the technology sector as companies respond to economic pressures and restructuring needs.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>Ecuador filed a formal complaint after an ICE agent tried to enter its Minneapolis consulate without permission. Consular staff prevented the entry, raising issues of diplomatic protocols and trust between countries in handling law enforcement matters abroad.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, President Zelensky condemned a Russian drone strike that killed five people on a packed passenger train in the country's northeast. The incident adds to the toll of the ongoing conflict and highlights the continuing risks to civilian life amid military actions.</p>
