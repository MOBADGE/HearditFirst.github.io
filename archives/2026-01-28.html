    <h2>Middle East Tensions and Iran Protests</h2>
<p>Tensions between the United States and Iran are rising amid warnings from Donald Trump that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal. The US military is increasing its presence in the Gulf, while Iranian armed forces remain prepared to respond to aggression, saying their "fingers are on the trigger." In addition, protests in Iran continue despite government crackdowns. Protesters report being treated in secret by medics willing to provide care at home to avoid arrest. The country's internet, which was shut down on January 8 as part of the crackdown, is slowly being restored but not for all users.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Drone Strike on Train</h2>
<p>A passenger on a busy train in Ukraine described the moment when Russian drones struck the train, killing five people. The attack caused panic among passengers, highlighting the ongoing dangers faced by civilians amid the conflict in the region. The incident underscores the continuing impact of the war on everyday life.</p>
<h2>Severe Storm Hits Portugal</h2>
<p>Storm Kristin has caused significant damage in Portugal, resulting in at least five deaths. The storm toppled trees, destroyed homes, and left over 800,000 people without power. Emergency services are dealing with the aftermath as the country works to restore normalcy.</p>
<h2>European Defence Debate</h2>
<p>The European Union's foreign policy chief emphasized the urgent need for Europe to strengthen its own defence capabilities instead of relying heavily on the United States. This statement follows comments from NATO's secretary general about Europe's dependence on US support for defence. The call may lead to discussions about increasing European military investment and strategic independence.</p>
<h2>Corporate and Political News</h2>
<p>Deutsche Bank is under investigation for past business relationships, leading to raids on its Frankfurt and Berlin offices. Meanwhile, Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs following an accidental email that revealed the planned layoffs hours earlier. In US political news, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was sprayed with an unidentified liquid during an event but was unharmed and continued her speech, saying, "I don't let bullies win."</p>
<h2>Aviation Accident in Colombia</h2>
<p>A plane carrying 13 passengers and 2 crew members crashed in Colombia, killing all 15 onboard. The state airline Satena confirmed that the aircraft suffered a fatal accident, but further details were not provided. The incident is under investigation.</p>
