    <h2>Legal and Political Developments</h2>
<p>A court in Hong Kong has sentenced media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who holds British citizenship, to 20 years in prison. Supporters of Lai have described the sentence as akin to a death penalty, while authorities contend it upholds the rule of law. Meanwhile, Palestinians have expressed concern over new Israeli measures in the West Bank, saying these policies effectively amount to annexation. The changes involve property laws, planning, licensing, and enforcement, potentially expanding Israeli control over the occupied territory.</p>
<h2>Jeffrey Epstein Case Updates</h2>
<p>In the United States, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is jailed as an associate of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, declined to answer questions during a congressional hearing by invoking her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. At the same time, survivors of Epstein's abuses have called for the full release of millions of files recently published by the Department of Justice. Many of these files contain redactions, prompting demands for complete disclosure. Additionally, Norwegian police are investigating diplomat Mona Juul and her husband Terje Rød-Larsen, noted for their role in the Oslo Accords, on allegations of aggravated corruption linked to the Epstein case.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>New York City has experienced extreme cold weather, resulting in the deaths of 18 people, mainly among the homeless population. In response, the city has increased the capacity of homeless shelters to accommodate the vulnerable during freezing conditions. In Mexico, the Canadian mining company Vizsla Silver Corp has reported that some of its workers who were kidnapped have been found dead, according to information provided by the families of the victims.</p>
<h2>Media and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny made history by performing an entirely Spanish-language set at the Super Bowl, the largest event in American sports. The performance marked a significant milestone for Latin music on a global stage. Former U.S. president Donald Trump criticized the show, describing it as "terrible."</p>
<h2>Public Appeals</h2>
<p>American television host Savannah Guthrie has made a public plea as a ransom deadline approaches for her missing mother, who is believed to be held by kidnappers. The video appeal aims to draw attention to the situation as efforts continue to secure her release.</p>
<h2>Security Forces in Iran</h2>
<p>BBC News Persian Forensic has confirmed that Iranian security forces used a wide range of deadly and non-lethal weapons during recent violence, including machine guns and machetes, which were involved in massacres that resulted in thousands of deaths. This investigative report sheds light on the scale and types of weapons deployed in these incidents.</p>
