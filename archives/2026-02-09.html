    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 09, 2026</div>
    <h2>Justice and Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been sentenced to 20 years in prison by a local court. Lai, who is also a British citizen, has supporters who describe the lengthy term as effectively a death sentence. Meanwhile, authorities in Hong Kong maintain the ruling upholds the rule of law.</p>
<p>In the United States, Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of the late Jeffrey Epstein, appeared in a congressional hearing but declined to answer questions about Epstein by invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. There is ongoing demand from survivors and others for the full release of files related to Epstein. Although the Department of Justice recently made millions of documents public, many parts remain redacted.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>In the West Bank, Palestinians have expressed strong opposition to new Israeli measures that affect property law, planning, licensing, and enforcement. These steps are seen by Palestinians as leading to a de facto annexation of more territory, heightening tensions in the long-standing conflict over the region.</p>
<p>Lebanon is grappling with infrastructure problems after two buildings collapsed, killing fifteen people. This latest incident is the fifth building collapse in Lebanon this winter, triggering calls for urgent action amid growing concerns about neglect and safety standards.</p>
<h2>International Security and Migration</h2>
<p>Reports from Iran reveal a diverse range of lethal and non-lethal weapons used by security forces resulting in thousands of casualties. BBC News Persian Forensic has confirmed the deployment of weaponry ranging from machine guns to machetes, underscoring the severity of the government's crackdown.</p>
<p>Off the coast of Libya, a migrant boat capsized, leading to the deaths of 53 people. The International Organization for Migration notes nearly 500 migrants have died or gone missing near Libya so far this year, highlighting the ongoing dangers faced by people attempting to cross the Mediterranean.</p>
<h2>Politics and Elections</h2>
<p>In Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party secured a strong electoral victory, winning 316 out of 465 seats. This outcome cements the leadership of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and provides a robust mandate for her government moving forward.</p>
<p>In South Korea, a controversial statement by Jindo county head Kim Hee-soo sparked outrage after suggesting the importation of young women from countries like Vietnam and Sri Lanka to address the low birth rate in rural areas. The comment has been widely criticized and brought attention to challenges around demographic shifts and social policy.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny made history by performing an entirely Spanish-language set at the Super Bowl halftime show. This marked a significant moment as he took center stage on one of the world’s most-watched entertainment events. Meanwhile, former U.S. president Donald Trump criticized the performance, describing it as "terrible," sparking further discussion on the show's reception.</p>
