    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 09, 2026</div>
    <h2>Asia and Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Jimmy Lai, a media tycoon and British citizen in Hong Kong, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Authorities describe the sentence as upholding the rule of law, while supporters of Lai view it as a harsh punishment. In the West Bank, Palestinians have criticized new Israeli policies that increase Israeli control over areas including property law and planning. These changes are seen by Palestinians as a move toward de facto annexation of the occupied territories.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings Connected to Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, known for her association with Jeffrey Epstein, appeared before Congress but chose not to answer questions about Epstein by invoking her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid self-incrimination. Meanwhile, survivors of Epstein's abuses are calling for the full release of millions of files about Epstein held by the US Department of Justice. Although some files have been made public, many remain partially redacted.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Public Reaction</h2>
<p>In South Korea, Jindo county head Kim Hee-soo caused outrage after suggesting the idea of "importing young women from Vietnam or Sri Lanka" to help young men in rural areas find partners amid a declining birth rate. This proposal has sparked considerable public criticism.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Human Tragedies</h2>
<p>Lebanon experienced another building collapse this winter, with two blocks falling and causing 15 deaths. This marks the fifth such incident amid growing concerns over neglect and building safety. Off the coast of Libya, a migrant boat capsized resulting in 53 deaths. The International Organization for Migration reported that nearly 500 people have died or gone missing trying to cross the Mediterranean from Libya so far this year.</p>
<h2>Politics and Culture Highlights</h2>
<p>Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s Liberal Democratic Party secured a significant victory in Japan’s recent election, winning 316 out of 465 seats. This marks a historic moment for Takaichi. In the United States, Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny made history with an all-Spanish performance at the Super Bowl, the sporting world’s largest stage. Former US political figure Donald Trump criticized the show, calling it "terrible."</p>
