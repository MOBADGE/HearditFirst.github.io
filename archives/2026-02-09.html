    <h2>Hong Kong Sentences Media Tycoon Jimmy Lai</h2>
<p>A Hong Kong court has sentenced Jimmy Lai, a media tycoon and British citizen, to 20 years in prison. Authorities say the sentence upholds the rule of law, but Lai’s supporters argue that the punishment is extremely harsh and effectively a death sentence. This case highlights the ongoing political tensions in Hong Kong and raises questions about press freedom and judicial independence in the region.</p>
<h2>Release of Epstein Files and Related Investigations</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice has released millions of files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. Many of the released documents remain heavily redacted, prompting survivors and advocates to call for full transparency. Meanwhile, in Norway, police are investigating diplomat Mona Juul and her husband Terje Rød-Larsen for alleged aggravated corruption linked to Epstein. The investigation focuses on connections between Epstein and prominent figures involved in diplomatic efforts, including the Oslo Accords.</p>
<h2>Extreme Cold in New York City Causes Deaths and Strain on Shelters</h2>
<p>New York City is coping with a severe cold snap that has resulted in 18 deaths. In response to the freezing temperatures, authorities have increased capacity at homeless shelters to provide protection for those at risk. The extreme weather has brought attention to the challenges faced by vulnerable populations during harsh winter conditions and the ongoing need for extended support services.</p>
<h2>Palestinian Concerns Over Israeli Measures in West Bank</h2>
<p>Palestinian officials have expressed strong opposition to new Israeli policies intended to tighten control over the occupied West Bank. These measures affect property laws, urban planning, licensing, and enforcement, which Palestinians say amount to de facto annexation. The changes could significantly alter the legal and administrative landscape of the West Bank, further complicating Israeli-Palestinian relations.</p>
<h2>Lebanon Faces Another Deadly Building Collapse</h2>
<p>Lebanon is experiencing a series of building collapses amid growing concerns about infrastructure neglect. The latest incident in the country’s ongoing crisis saw two blocks fall, killing at least 15 people. This marks the fifth such disaster during the winter season, underscoring urgent calls from residents and officials for improved safety regulations and stronger maintenance of the nation’s aging structures.</p>
