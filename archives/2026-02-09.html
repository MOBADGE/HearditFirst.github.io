    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 09, 2026</div>
    <h2>Asia-Pacific Politics</h2>
<p>Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her Liberal Democratic Party achieved a significant electoral victory, securing 316 out of 465 seats in the recent national election. This strong majority positions Takaichi and her party to advance their legislative agenda comfortably.</p>
<p>In South Korea, a controversial statement by Kim Hee-soo, head of Jindo county, sparked public outrage. He suggested "importing young women from Vietnam or Sri Lanka" to address the local birth rate and demographic challenges in rural areas. The comment has drawn criticism amid ongoing debates about immigration and social policy in South Korea.</p>
<h2>Middle East and North Africa</h2>
<p>Lebanon faced another tragic event as two blocks collapsed in a building disaster that killed fifteen people. This is the fifth such collapse this winter, raising serious concerns about worsening structural neglect and poor building maintenance amid the country's economic and infrastructure struggles.</p>
<p>In the West Bank, Palestinians are protesting new Israeli government measures they say amount to de facto annexation. These actions involve changes to property law, planning, licensing, and enforcement, all aimed at increasing Israeli control over the occupied territory. The situation remains a flashpoint in regional tensions and international diplomatic efforts.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Justice</h2>
<p>Jimmy Lai, a media figure and British citizen, was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a Hong Kong court. Authorities framed the sentence as an example of the rule of law, but Lai's supporters described it as a harsh punishment with fatal consequences for his freedom and work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, Ghislaine Maxwell, associated with Jeffrey Epstein, appeared before Congress but refused to answer questions, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Department of Justice has released millions of documents related to Epstein's activities; however, many are heavily redacted, prompting calls from survivors for full transparency.</p>
<h2>Migration and Maritime Safety</h2>
<p>A migrant boat capsized off the coast of Libya, resulting in the deaths of 53 people. The International Organization for Migration reports nearly 500 migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean near Libya so far this year, highlighting ongoing humanitarian and safety challenges related to migration in the region.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>At the Super Bowl, Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny made history by performing an entirely Spanish-language set, marking a significant cultural milestone on one of the world's biggest entertainment stages. The performance received mixed reactions, including criticism from former US President Donald Trump, who described the show as "terrible." Bad Bunny's appearance underscores the growing influence of Latin music and culture in mainstream American events.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict in Iran</h2>
<p>BBC News Persian Forensic has detailed the deployment of a wide range of weapons used by Iranian security forces in recent violent incidents. These include lethal and non-lethal arms, from machine guns to machetes, illustrating the severe crackdown measures taken amid ongoing unrest in Iran.</p>
