    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>The US president has warned that the United States will intervene if Iran kills protesters amid ongoing demonstrations and clashes. He stated, "we will come to their rescue," signaling a strong stance on protecting demonstrators. Meanwhile, tension continues in Ukraine and Russia. Russia accused Ukraine of killing 27 people in a New Year attack in the occupied Kherson region. Ukraine responded by emphasizing that it targets only military sites and complies with international law. Adding to leadership changes, Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukrainian military intelligence known for effective strikes against Russia, has been appointed to lead the presidential office.</p>
<h2>Economic and Trade Developments</h2>
<p>The US has decided to significantly reduce proposed tariffs on Italian pasta imports. The initial plan targeted 13 producers and threatened to raise prices for American consumers. This move may ease trade tensions and benefit US buyers. In the automotive sector, China's BYD has surpassed Tesla to become the world's top electric vehicle seller for the first time, marking a shift in the global EV market and reflecting China's growing influence in this industry.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns and Migration</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck off the coast of Gambia where a boat carrying around 200 migrants sank, leaving dozens missing. This incident highlights the dangers faced by West African migrants trying to reach Spain, as the route remains one of the world's most perilous. In India, families in Indore are mourning the deaths of four people reportedly caused by contaminated tap water, though some families suggest the death toll is higher. Authorities continue to investigate the situation.</p>
<h2>Political and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro expressed openness to dialogue with the US regarding drug trafficking during a state TV interview. However, he avoided responding to questions about an attack in Venezuela that the US had attributed to external actors. Meanwhile, in Japan, the prime minister has joined calls for improving facilities for women in parliament, focusing on the need for more female toilets in the historic parliament building, which dates back to 1936—before women were granted voting rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Health and Personal Updates</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, the US president revealed that he takes a higher daily dose of aspirin than typically recommended by doctors. He explained this choice by saying, "I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart," indicating his personal approach to managing heart health.</p>
