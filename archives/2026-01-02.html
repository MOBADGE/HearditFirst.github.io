    <h2>Tragic Fire in Swiss Bar Under Investigation</h2>
<p>A fire at a Swiss bar has claimed the lives of 40 people. Authorities believe the blaze likely started from sparklers on champagne bottles, and investigations are ongoing to determine whether any criminal prosecutions are needed. Families of some of the victims, including teenagers as young as 15, continue to seek information about missing loved ones believed to have been present during the incident. The tragedy has deeply affected the local community and raised questions about safety measures at public venues.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions and Conflict in Yemen</h2>
<p>Clashes in Yemen have intensified as Saudi- and UAE-backed forces confront each other, supporting rival sides in the country's ongoing conflict. This escalation threatens to further divide Yemen and complicates efforts to stabilize the region. The involvement of these powerful Gulf allies highlights the broader geopolitical stakes tied to the conflict, which has already caused significant humanitarian challenges.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Relations and Protests</h2>
<p>The US president has warned that the United States will intervene if Iran kills protesters amid ongoing demonstrations and clashes. After days of unrest, the US stance signals a willingness to come to the aid of those protesting, indicating heightened tensions between the countries. How this will affect diplomatic relations or the situation on the ground in Iran remains uncertain.</p>
<h2>Changes in Ukraine’s Leadership Amid Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appointed Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the Hur military intelligence unit, to lead the presidential office following a corruption scandal. Budanov’s intelligence unit has been credited with numerous effective strikes against Russia amid the conflict between the two countries. This leadership change suggests a focus on strengthening Ukraine’s intelligence efforts during the ongoing war.</p>
<h2>Business and Trade Updates: Pasta Tariffs and Electric Vehicles</h2>
<p>The US government has decided to significantly reduce proposed tariffs on Italian pasta imports. The initial plan targeted 13 producers with steep tariffs which would have raised prices for American consumers. Meanwhile, Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has surpassed Tesla as the world’s top EV seller for the first time, marking a shift in the global electric vehicle market. These developments reflect ongoing changes in international trade and industry competition.</p>
<h2>Migrant Tragedy Off West African Coast</h2>
<p>A boat carrying around 200 migrants sank off the coast of Gambia, leaving dozens missing. This incident underscores the dangers faced by West Africans attempting to reach Spain via one of the world’s most perilous migration routes. The tragedy adds to the ongoing humanitarian concerns about migrant safety and the risks involved in such journeys.</p>
