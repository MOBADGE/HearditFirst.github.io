    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The US president has warned that the United States will intervene if Iran harms protesters amid ongoing demonstrations and clashes in the country. He stated, "we will come to their rescue," signaling a potential escalation in international involvement depending on Iran’s actions. This development highlights rising tensions in the region and suggests the situation could draw in external powers if the violence continues or escalates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Venezuela’s president has expressed openness to talks with the United States on combating drug trafficking. In an interview with state TV, he did not directly address a recent attack in Venezuela that the US has claimed responsibility for, leaving some questions unanswered. These statements could indicate a cautious willingness to engage on shared security concerns despite ongoing political friction.</p>
<h2>Migration and Humanitarian Concerns</h2>
<p>A tragic incident occurred off the coast of Gambia where a boat carrying about 200 migrants sank, with dozens reported missing. This accident is part of a continuing pattern of dangerous sea crossings by West Africans attempting to reach Spain. The event underscores the risks faced by migrants and the enduring challenges in managing migration routes.</p>
<p>Separately, a report highlights the plight of millions of stateless people worldwide who live without official identification such as birth certificates. Lacking these documents often means limited access to rights and services, effectively rendering them invisible in society. This issue points to a significant humanitarian and legal challenge on a global scale.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business</h2>
<p>China's electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is expected to surpass Tesla in annual sales for the first time. This milestone would mark a significant shift in the global EV market, indicating growing competition and the expanding influence of Chinese companies in the automotive industry. The event may have implications for market dynamics and innovation in electric vehicles worldwide.</p>
<h2>Domestic Issues in Japan</h2>
<p>Japan’s parliament has launched a campaign, supported by the prime minister, to increase the number of female restrooms in the historic parliament building. The facility was built in 1936, before women had voting rights in the country, and currently offers inadequate facilities for female members and visitors. This initiative reflects ongoing efforts to address gender disparities and improve workplace conditions in government institutions.</p>
<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
<p>In the United States, the president revealed in a recent interview that he takes a higher daily dose of aspirin than is typically recommended by doctors, explaining this as a precaution against blood thickening in his heart. His comments bring attention to personal health decisions made by public figures, though they may differ from medical guidelines.</p>
<p>In India, families in Indore are mourning deaths linked to contaminated tap water. Officials report four fatalities, though relatives believe the true toll could be higher. This situation highlights ongoing water safety and public health challenges in the area.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Rescue Operations</h2>
<p>Several dozen people are presumed dead following a fire at a New Year party in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana. Investigations and identification of victims are ongoing. The tragedy has prompted a focus on safety regulations at public events.</p>
<p>Additionally, four men were recently rescued after their boat suffered motor failure and drifted toward the edge of a dam. The timely rescue prevented a potentially fatal accident, demonstrating the importance of emergency response capabilities in water-related incidents.</p>
