    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>The United States has issued a warning to Iran amid ongoing protests, with the US president stating that America "will come to their rescue" if Iran kills demonstrators. This follows several days of demonstrations and clashes in Iran. Meanwhile, tensions remain high in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Russia accused Ukraine of killing 27 people in a New Year attack in the occupied city of Kherson. Ukraine responded by emphasizing that its strikes target only military objectives and comply with international law.</p>
<p>In Ukraine’s political landscape, Kyrylo Budanov, who has led the country’s military intelligence and is credited with effective strikes against Russia, has been named to head the Ukrainian presidential office. This leadership change may have implications for how Ukraine manages its intelligence and strategic operations moving forward.</p>
<h2>US Domestic News</h2>
<p>The US president shared details about his health, revealing in an interview that he takes a higher daily dose of aspirin than doctors typically recommend. He explained his decision as a preventive measure, saying he does not want "thick blood pouring through my heart." This insight into his health regimen may attract attention regarding presidential health transparency.</p>
<h2>Latin America Relations and Issues</h2>
<p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro indicated openness to talks with the United States about drug trafficking in an interview on state television. However, Maduro avoided answering questions about a recent attack in Venezuela that the US claimed responsibility for. These developments could signal potential shifts or continuations in US-Venezuela relations, particularly concerning security and drug-related matters.</p>
<h2>Economy and Business</h2>
<p>In the electric vehicle market, China's BYD is poised to overtake Tesla as the world’s leading EV seller for the first time. This milestone reflects shifting dynamics in the global automotive industry and highlights BYD's growing influence in electric vehicle sales and technology.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Social Issues</h2>
<p>Millions of people around the world face challenges due to the lack of birth certificates, effectively rendering them invisible in official records. This statelessness affects access to services and legal protections. Meanwhile, in West Africa, a tragic incident occurred when a boat carrying 200 migrants sank off the coast of Gambia, with dozens reported missing. The route is known as one of the world's most dangerous for migrants attempting to reach Spain.</p>
<p>In India, families in Indore are mourning the deaths of at least four people who consumed contaminated tap water, although some allege the death toll is higher. This raises ongoing concerns about water safety and public health infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Social Infrastructure Reform</h2>
<p>In Japan, the prime minister has joined a campaign to increase the number of female toilets in the country’s parliament building, originally constructed in 1936, before women had voting rights. This move is part of broader efforts to address gender inclusivity and modernize parliamentary facilities to better reflect current demographics.</p>
