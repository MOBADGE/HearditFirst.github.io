    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Venezuela's president expressed openness to talks with the United States on drug trafficking issues during an interview with state TV. However, he avoided responding to questions about a recent attack in Venezuela that the US has claimed involvement in. This development could signal a potential thaw in otherwise tense relations, depending on how dialogue progresses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran continues to experience growing unrest as protests have reached their fifth day. Clashes between demonstrators and security forces have become increasingly violent, with videos circulating on social media showing cars set on fire during the confrontations. The situation remains fluid and may escalate further if tensions are not addressed.</p>
<h2>Migration and Humanitarian Concerns</h2>
<p>A tragic incident occurred off the coast of Gambia where a boat carrying approximately 200 migrants sank. Dozens are reported missing in what is another disaster along a perilous route frequently used by West African migrants attempting to reach Spain. This tragedy highlights ongoing risks faced by those undertaking dangerous journeys in search of better opportunities.</p>
<p>On a related humanitarian topic, millions of stateless people around the world continue to live without official birth certificates or documentation. This lack of legal identity renders them effectively invisible to governments, affecting their access to basic rights and services.</p>
<h2>Business and Technology</h2>
<p>China’s BYD is set to surpass Tesla as the world’s leading seller of electric vehicles for the first time based on annual sales figures. BYD’s rising prominence reflects the growing strength of Chinese firms in the global EV market and may influence competitive dynamics going forward as the industry evolves.</p>
<h2>Government and Society</h2>
<p>In Japan, the prime minister has spotlighted the need for more female-friendly facilities in the national parliament building, which was constructed long before women received voting rights in the country. This move aims to modernize the institution’s infrastructure and foster a more inclusive environment for female lawmakers.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In a separate story, former US president Donald Trump asserted in a recent interview that his health is "perfect." He discussed his makeup routine, ability to function on little sleep, and regular aspirin use, seemingly addressing public curiosity about his well-being.</p>
<p>Lastly, a 400-pound prop used in a live Indiana Jones recreation at Disney unexpectedly ran loose and injured an employee during the performance. This incident is a reminder of the unique risks involved in live entertainment productions.</p>
