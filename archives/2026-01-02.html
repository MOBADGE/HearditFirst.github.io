    <h2>Fire at Swiss Bar Kills 40</h2>
<p>A fire at a bar in Switzerland has resulted in the deaths of 40 people. Officials investigating the blaze believe it may have been started by sparklers on champagne bottles. They are also considering whether criminal prosecutions will be necessary. This tragedy has raised safety concerns regarding the use of sparklers indoors and event fire precautions. Families of teenagers reported missing after the fire have made urgent appeals for information, especially for those as young as 15 thought to have been at the venue. The situation remains fluid as rescue and identification efforts continue.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Tensions Amid Protests</h2>
<p>The US president has issued a warning to Iran, saying the United States will intervene if Iranian authorities kill protesters. This statement comes after days of demonstrations and clashes within Iran. The warning underscores heightened tensions between the two countries. The US president emphasized readiness to rescue protesters, signaling a potential stance of involuntary intervention if violence escalates further. The international community will be watching closely to see if the situation intensifies or if diplomatic measures can reduce hostilities.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and Russia Clash Over Kherson Region</h2>
<p>Russia has accused Ukraine of killing 27 people in an attack in the occupied Kherson region over the New Year period. Ukraine responded by stating it only targets military objectives and complies with international law. This incident marks another episode in the ongoing conflict affecting the area, highlighting the continued violence and suffering experienced by civilians. The claims and counterclaims add to the complexity of the conflict, with both sides emphasizing different narratives about responsibility and legality of recent strikes.</p>
<h2>Yemen Conflict Deepens with Gulf Backing</h2>
<p>Clashes in Yemen have recently brought forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates into direct confrontation. The two powerful Gulf allies support rival factions in the conflict, which threatens to further divide the country. The escalation increases risks of a wider and more entrenched conflict within Yemen, complicating existing humanitarian challenges. The involvement of external backers signals the continued geopolitical struggles in the region, which could have broader implications for peace efforts.</p>
<h2>Technology and Economy: BYD Surpasses Tesla</h2>
<p>Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world’s top seller of electric vehicles for the first time. This milestone marks a shift in the global EV market, where BYD's annual sales have outpaced its American rival. The development reflects changing competitive dynamics in the industry, driven by consumer demand and production strategies. This could influence the direction of EV innovation and market trends in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Migration Tragedy Off Gambia</h2>
<p>At least dozens of people are missing after a boat carrying around 200 migrants sank off the coast of Gambia. This is part of a perilous migration route used by many West Africans attempting to reach Spain. The incident highlights ongoing dangers faced by migrants undertaking sea crossings in search of better opportunities. Efforts to improve safety and humanitarian support remain critical as this tragic pattern continues.</p>
