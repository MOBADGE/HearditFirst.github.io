    <h2>Fire and Investigation in Swiss Bar Tragedy</h2>
<p>A devastating fire at a Swiss bar has killed 40 people. Initial investigations suggest the fire may have started due to sparklers used on champagne bottles. Authorities are assessing the situation to determine if criminal charges should be pursued. This tragedy has drawn wide attention because of the high casualty count and raises concerns about safety regulations in public venues.</p>
<h2>Families Search for Missing Teens After Fire</h2>
<p>Following the bar fire, families are urgently seeking information about teenagers who are unaccounted for. Some missing individuals are as young as 15 years old. The emotional impact on these families highlights the ongoing distress and uncertainty caused by the incident, underscoring the need for thorough search and rescue efforts.</p>
<h2>US Response to Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>The US president has issued a warning to Iran amid ongoing protests and clashes between demonstrators and officials. He stated that the US would intervene if Iranian authorities harm protesters, saying "we will come to their rescue." This statement signals escalating concern over human rights and could impact international relations depending on future developments in Iran.</p>
<h2>Changes in Ukraine’s Presidential Office Leadership</h2>
<p>Kyrylo Budanov, who has led Ukrainian military intelligence and been involved in operations against Russia, has been appointed to head the Ukrainian presidential office. This appointment follows a corruption scandal and may indicate a shift in the administration’s approach to governance and security.</p>
<h2>Economic Updates: US Tariffs and Global Trade</h2>
<p>In trade news, the US government has significantly reduced proposed tariffs on Italian pasta products. The original tariffs targeted 13 producers and threatened to raise prices for consumers. This tariff adjustment reflects ongoing negotiations and potential efforts to ease trade tensions with Italy.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chinese electric vehicle company BYD has surpassed Tesla to become the world’s top EV seller for the first time. This milestone reflects changes in the global electric vehicle market and highlights increased competition, especially from Chinese manufacturers.</p>
<h2>Other Noteworthy Events</h2>
<p>A boat carrying around 200 migrants sank off Gambia, resulting in dozens of people missing. This incident is part of a larger pattern of dangerous migration routes taken by West Africans seeking to reach Spain.</p>
<p>In the United States, a woman in Colorado was reportedly killed in a suspected mountain lion attack—the first fatal such incident in the state in over 25 years, pending confirmation. This rare event draws attention to wildlife encounters and public safety.</p>
<p>Lastly, Anthony Joshua’s driver has been charged over a vehicle crash in Nigeria that killed two members of Joshua’s team. Joshua was a passenger in the crash, which has brought focus to road safety concerns in the region.</p>
