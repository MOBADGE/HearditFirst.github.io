    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro has expressed openness to talks with the United States regarding drug trafficking issues. In an interview on state television, Maduro did not directly address a US claim about an attack in Venezuela but emphasized his willingness to engage in dialogue. This development could lead to renewed discussions between the two countries on security and cooperation, although details remain limited.</p>
<h2>Migration and Humanitarian Concerns</h2>
<p>A tragic incident off the coast of Gambia has left dozens missing after a boat carrying around 200 migrants sank. The vessel was traveling one of the most perilous migration routes from West Africa to Spain. This event highlights ongoing risks faced by people attempting to cross dangerous waters in search of better opportunities. International attention to migration safety and rescue efforts remains critical.</p>
<h2>Civil Unrest in Iran</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have entered their fifth day, with violent clashes reported between protesters and security forces. Videos circulating on social media show scenes of cars set ablaze and running battles in the streets. The unrest signals rising tensions within the country and potential challenges for Iranian authorities in managing dissent.</p>
<h2>Automotive Industry Shift</h2>
<p>China’s electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is on track to surpass Tesla in annual EV sales for the first time. This milestone would mark a significant shift in the global electric vehicle market, emphasizing China’s growing influence in clean energy transportation. The competition between BYD and Tesla could drive further innovation and expansion in the electric vehicle sector.</p>
<h2>Social Issues: Identity and Equality</h2>
<p>Globally, millions of people live without birth certificates, effectively rendering them stateless and invisible in official records. Lack of identification can severely limit access to basic services and legal rights, trapping individuals in poverty and exclusion. Meanwhile, in Japan, the prime minister has personally advocated for more female restrooms in the country’s parliament building, reflecting ongoing efforts to address gender equality and update outdated facilities in government institutions.</p>
<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
<p>In a recent health interview, US president Donald Trump shared that he takes a higher daily dose of aspirin than doctors typically recommend, explaining his concern about preventing "thick blood" affecting his heart. Additionally, an unusual accident occurred during a live Indiana Jones film scene reenactment at a Disney event, when a 400-pound runaway prop injured an employee. These incidents remind us of the importance of health precautions and safety measures in various settings.</p>
