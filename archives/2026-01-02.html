    <h2>International Relations: Venezuela Opens Door to US Talks on Drug Trafficking</h2>
<p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has expressed a willingness to engage in discussions with the United States on drug trafficking issues. In a recent interview broadcast on state television, Maduro indicated openness to such talks, though he avoided responding directly to questions about a recent attack in Venezuela that the US has claimed responsibility for. This signals a potential thaw in diplomatic interaction centered on shared concerns about illegal drug trade, which could impact regional security and cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Social Issues: Millions Lack Birth Certificates, Living as Stateless People</h2>
<p>An estimated millions of people around the world face life without official identification due to the absence of birth certificates. These individuals are often stateless, which severely limits access to basic rights, services, and protections. Without legal recognition, they remain invisible to governments, which exacerbates challenges related to education, healthcare, employment, and legal protections. Addressing this documentation gap is crucial for ensuring more inclusive societies and protection of human rights globally.</p>
<h2>Protests and Unrest: Violent Clashes Continue in Iran</h2>
<p>Iran has experienced ongoing unrest now entering its fifth day, with violent clashes reported between protesters and security forces. Social media videos show incidents of cars being set ablaze amid running battles in different parts of the country. The persistence and intensity of the protests highlight rising public discontent and a volatile security situation, which may lead to further instability unless addressed through dialogue or reforms by Iranian authorities.</p>
<h2>Economy and Business: Chinese EV Maker BYD Nears Top Spot, Set to Pass Tesla</h2>
<p>China's electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is poised to overtake American company Tesla as the world's leading seller of electric vehicles based on annual sales. This would be the first year BYD surpasses Tesla in this benchmark, reflecting the rapid growth of China’s EV market and BYD’s expanding global footprint. This development indicates shifting dynamics in the automotive industry, with increasing competition in the EV sector likely to influence pricing, innovation, and market strategy worldwide.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Concerns: Migrant Boat Sinks Off Gambia, Many Missing</h2>
<p>A boat carrying approximately 200 migrants sank off the coast of Gambia, leaving dozens unaccounted for. This tragic incident highlights the dangers faced by migrants attempting to reach Spain via one of the world’s most perilous migration routes. The sinking underscores ongoing humanitarian and safety challenges related to irregular migration across the Atlantic and raises urgent questions about protection and support for vulnerable populations undertaking these journeys.</p>
<h2>Domestic Developments: Japan’s Prime Minister Advocates for More Female Toilets in Parliament</h2>
<p>Japan is addressing a practical gender equity issue in its parliament building, constructed in 1936 before women’s suffrage was established in the country. The Prime Minister has joined calls for increasing the number of female toilets to better accommodate women members and visitors. This initiative reflects evolving awareness and commitment to creating a more inclusive environment in government institutions that historically lacked provisions for gender balance.</p>
