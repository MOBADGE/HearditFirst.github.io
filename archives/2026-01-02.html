    <h2>Venezuela Open to US Talks on Drug Trafficking</h2>
<p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has signaled openness to dialogue with the United States regarding drug trafficking issues. In a recent interview on state television, Maduro expressed a willingness to engage in talks, although he did not directly address questions about a recent attack in Venezuela that the US has claimed responsibility for. This potential cooperation could mark a shift in relations between the two countries, which have experienced tension in recent years. Future discussions may focus on curbing the drug trade in the region, which remains a significant concern for both nations.</p>
<h2>Statelessness and the Challenge of Lacking Birth Certificates</h2>
<p>Millions of people worldwide live without official birth certificates, rendering them effectively stateless and invisible in their own societies. Without these vital records, individuals struggle to access basic rights and services, such as education, healthcare, and legal employment. The lack of documentation leaves these individuals vulnerable to exploitation and marginalization. Addressing this issue requires coordinated efforts by governments and international organizations to ensure that every person can be officially recognized and protected under the law.</p>
<h2>Growing Unrest and Violence in Iran</h2>
<p>Protests in Iran have entered their fifth day, marked by increasing violence between demonstrators and security forces. Social media videos show ongoing clashes, including incidents of cars being set on fire amid running battles. The escalation in unrest highlights widespread dissatisfaction and volatile conditions within the country. How the government responds to the continuing protests will be crucial in determining whether the situation stabilizes or further deteriorates over the coming days.</p>
<h2>BYD Poised to Surpass Tesla in Electric Vehicle Sales</h2>
<p>Chinese automaker BYD is on track to become the world’s largest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), potentially overtaking American company Tesla for the first time in annual sales. This milestone would reflect the rapid growth of the Chinese EV market and highlight BYD’s expanding global influence in the automotive industry. The shift could affect competitive dynamics in the electric car market, encouraging innovation and changes in pricing strategies among leading manufacturers.</p>
<h2>Japan’s Prime Minister Supports More Female Toilets in Parliament</h2>
<p>Japan’s parliament building, constructed in 1936 before women gained voting rights in the country, currently has an insufficient number of toilets for female lawmakers and visitors. The Prime Minister of Japan has recently advocated for increasing the number of women’s toilets in the building. This move is part of broader efforts to make governmental spaces more inclusive and better accommodate gender diversity. Improving facilities may encourage greater female participation and representation in politics over time.</p>
<h2>Trump Addresses Health Amid Aging Concerns</h2>
<p>In an interview, former US President Donald Trump discussed his health, describing it as “perfect” despite widespread speculation about his aging. He mentioned using hand makeup, getting by on limited sleep, and regularly taking aspirin. Trump’s statements aim to reassure supporters and the public about his physical condition, possibly in anticipation of future political activities. Maintaining public confidence in a political figure’s health can be a significant factor in their ongoing influence and engagement.</p>
