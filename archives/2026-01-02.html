    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The US president has issued a strong warning to Iran amid ongoing protests and clashes. He stated that the United States "will come to their rescue" if Iranian authorities kill protesters, signaling possible US intervention to protect demonstrators. This development comes as tensions continue to rise in the region, suggesting potential diplomatic and security challenges ahead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Venezuela's president expressed openness to dialogue with the United States on issues concerning drug trafficking. In a state television interview, he indicated a willingness to engage in talks but avoided directly addressing a question about a recent attack in Venezuela that the US has claimed responsibility for. These remarks could signal a tentative step toward cooperation between the two countries on shared concerns.</p>
<h2>Migration and Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck off the coast of Gambia where a boat carrying 200 migrants sank, leaving dozens missing. This incident highlights the ongoing dangers faced by West African migrants trying to reach Spain via one of the world’s most perilous routes. Rescue efforts continue amid concerns over the large number of people unaccounted for.</p>
<p>In a separate story, millions of people worldwide remain stateless, living "in the shadows" without official birth certificates or identity papers. Lack of documentation denies them access to basic rights and services, underscoring a persistent global humanitarian issue.</p>
<h2>Environment and Public Health</h2>
<p>In India, officials have confirmed that four people died after consuming contaminated tap water in the city of Indore, though affected families believe the death toll may be higher. This raises concerns about water safety standards and the urgent need for improved infrastructure to prevent further health crises.</p>
<h2>Business and Economy</h2>
<p>China's electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is on track to surpass Tesla in annual global EV sales for the first time. This milestone marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape of the electric vehicle market, with implications for the future of the automotive industry and global green energy efforts.</p>
<h2>Domestic Affairs and Public Infrastructure</h2>
<p>In Japan, the prime minister is advocating for increased availability of female toilets in the country’s parliament building. The building, constructed in 1936 before women had the right to vote, has inadequate facilities for women lawmakers. This initiative highlights broader discussions about gender equity and modernization in public institutions.</p>
<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
<p>The US president revealed he takes a daily aspirin dose higher than what doctors typically recommend, explaining, "I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart." This personal health disclosure may invite public discussion on medical advice and presidential health transparency.</p>
<p>Separately, four men were rescued after their boat, suffering motor failure, drifted perilously close to a dam's edge. The incident, captured on video, ended safely but serves as a reminder of boating hazards and the importance of prompt rescue responses.</p>
<h2>Tragedy in Switzerland</h2>
<p>A major fire at the Crans-Montana resort in Switzerland may have claimed several dozen lives. Among those feared dead is a young Italian golfer. Authorities continue to investigate the cause and extent of the disaster, which has shocked the local community and visitors.</p>
