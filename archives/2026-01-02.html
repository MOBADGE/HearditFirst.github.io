    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 02, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has expressed openness to talks with the United States regarding drug trafficking issues. In a recent state TV interview, Maduro indicated willingness to engage in discussions but avoided directly addressing a US-claimed attack in Venezuela. This gesture could signal a potential easing of tensions between the two countries, though the situation remains uncertain.</p>
<h2>Social Issues</h2>
<p>Millions of people worldwide live without official birth certificates, effectively rendering them stateless and invisible in society. This lack of documentation restricts access to basic rights and services, leaving these individuals marginalized and vulnerable. The global challenge highlights the need for improved registration systems to ensure legal recognition for all.</p>
<h2>Protests and Unrest</h2>
<p>Unrest continues in Iran as protests entered their fifth day, marked by deadly clashes between protesters and security forces. Videos circulating on social media show cars set on fire amid ongoing confrontations, underscoring the intensity of the situation. The continuing demonstrations reflect deep-rooted grievances and could lead to further instability if not addressed.</p>
<h2>Migrant Crisis</h2>
<p>A boat carrying around 200 migrants sank off the coast of Gambia, leaving dozens missing. This tragedy is part of a frequent pattern on one of the world's most dangerous migration routes used by West Africans attempting to reach Spain. The incident highlights the ongoing risks faced by migrants and the humanitarian challenges involved in managing these crossings.</p>
<h2>Technology and Business</h2>
<p>China's electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is set to surpass Tesla in annual sales, a first for the company. This milestone indicates a significant shift in the global EV market, with the Chinese firm challenging the American competitor's dominance. The change may influence future developments in electric vehicle production and international competition.</p>
<h2>Environment and Public Safety</h2>
<p>In Indore, India, at least four deaths have been officially attributed to contaminated tap water, though local families believe the number may be higher. The incident raises concerns about water safety and public health infrastructure in the region. Ensuring access to clean water remains a critical issue for preventing further tragedies.</p>
