    <h2>Tragic Fire in Swiss Bar Under Investigation</h2>
<p>Authorities are investigating a deadly fire in a Swiss bar that killed 40 people. Officials suspect the blaze may have started due to sparklers placed on champagne bottles. They have not ruled out criminal charges as part of their inquiry. Meanwhile, families of teenagers believed to have been at the bar are urgently seeking news about their missing loved ones. Some of the missing are as young as 15, and relatives describe the situation as a nightmare as they wait for information.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions and Military Moves</h2>
<p>In ongoing geopolitical developments, Kyrylo Budanov, who has led the Hur military intelligence and claimed responsibility for several effective strikes, has been appointed to head a presidential office. In Yemen, conflict is intensifying as forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates clash. This confrontation between powerful Gulf allies threatens to deepen divisions within the country.</p>
<h2>Conflicts and Accusations</h2>
<p>Russia has accused Ukraine of killing 27 people in a New Year's attack in the occupied Kherson region. Ukraine maintains that its strikes target only military objectives and comply with international law. This exchange highlights ongoing hostilities in the region.</p>
<h2>U.S. and International News</h2>
<p>The US president has issued a warning that the United States will intervene if Iran kills protesters amid days of demonstrations and clashes. In trade news, the US has scaled back proposed tariffs on Italian pasta imports. This move downplays initial plans that might have led to higher prices for American consumers.</p>
<h2>Business and Transportation Incidents</h2>
<p>China's BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle seller for the first time, marking a significant shift in the EV market. In Nigeria, the driver of former heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua has been charged following a car crash that killed two members of Joshua's team. Joshua was in the vehicle but was not reported hurt.</p>
<h2>Migrant Boat Tragedy in West Africa</h2>
<p>A boat carrying around 200 migrants sank off the coast of Gambia, with dozens still missing. This incident adds to the dangers faced by those traveling one of the most perilous routes from West Africa to Spain. Rescue and recovery efforts are ongoing as the toll remains uncertain.</p>
