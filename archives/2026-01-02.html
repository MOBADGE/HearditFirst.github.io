    <h2>Tragic Fire at Swiss Bar Under Investigation</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities are investigating a fire that killed 40 people at a local bar, with initial findings suggesting the blaze may have started from sparklers attached to champagne bottles. Officials are assessing whether criminal charges should be filed in connection with the incident. The fire has also left families in distress, especially those with missing children believed to be as young as 15, who were at the venue during the tragedy. Efforts to locate the missing teens continue amid growing concern.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions in Yemen</h2>
<p>Clashes have escalated in Yemen, involving factions supported by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two powerful Gulf states backing opposing sides in the ongoing conflict. This confrontation further endangers Yemen’s stability and risks deepening divisions within the country. The rivalry between these allies complicates efforts to reach a peaceful resolution as violence intensifies.</p>
<h2>US Reacts to Protests in Iran</h2>
<p>The president of the United States has issued a warning indicating possible intervention if Iranian authorities use lethal force against protesters. His statement comes after several days of demonstrations and violent clashes in Iran. He emphasized that the US would "come to their rescue," signaling increased international attention on the protests occurring inside Iran.</p>
<h2>Changes in Ukraine’s Presidential Office Leadership</h2>
<p>Ukrainian leadership has appointed Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Hur military intelligence, to lead the presidential office following a corruption scandal. Budanov is known for directing highly effective strikes against Russian forces. This change represents a significant shift in the country’s leadership amid ongoing conflict with Russia.</p>
<h2>Global Trade and Transportation Updates</h2>
<p>In trade news, the United States has significantly reduced proposed tariffs on Italian pasta imports. This move prevents potential price increases for American consumers that could have resulted from steep tariffs on 13 Italian producers.</p>
<p>In transportation, a tragic accident occurred involving the car of former heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua. His driver has been charged after a crash in Nigeria that killed two members of Joshua’s team. Joshua was a passenger during the incident.</p>
<h2>Migrant Boat Disaster off West Africa</h2>
<p>A boat carrying approximately 200 migrants sank near Gambia, with dozens still missing following the disaster. This event is part of a recurring pattern of accidents on one of the world’s most perilous migration routes, used by West Africans attempting to reach Spain. Rescue and recovery efforts are ongoing amid fears of a high death toll.</p>
<h2>Electric Vehicle Market Shift</h2>
<p>China’s BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle seller for the first time, marking a shift in the global EV market. This milestone highlights the rising influence of Chinese manufacturers in the rapidly growing electric car industry.</p>
