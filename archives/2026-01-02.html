    <h2>Fire Tragedy in Swiss Bar Under Investigation</h2>
<p>A fire at a Swiss bar that killed 40 people is believed to have started due to sparklers being lit on champagne bottles, investigators said. Authorities are examining whether criminal charges are needed in connection with the blaze. The incident has raised questions about safety regulations at venues that host large gatherings.</p>
<p>Families of some of the victims, including teenagers as young as 15, remain desperate for news about missing loved ones. The tragedy has deeply affected the local community as efforts continue to clarify the cause and consequences of the fire.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions in Yemen Conflict</h2>
<p>Clashes in Yemen have brought forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates into direct confrontation. These two Gulf allies support different sides in an escalating conflict that threatens to deepen divisions within Yemen. The fighting highlights the complex regional dynamics and the challenges to peace in the country.</p>
<h2>Changes in Ukrainian Leadership Amid Conflict</h2>
<p>Ukraine's president has appointed Kyrylo Budanov, who leads the country's military intelligence agency known for carrying out effective strikes against Russia, to head the presidential office. This move follows a recent corruption controversy. The appointment could influence Ukraine's strategic approach as tensions remain high with Russia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia accused Ukraine of an attack in the occupied Kherson region over the New Year period that killed 27 people. Ukraine stated that its strikes target only military objectives and comply with international law, underscoring the ongoing conflict between the two nations.</p>
<h2>US Adjusts Trade and Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>The United States has decided to reduce proposed tariffs on Italian pasta imports after initial plans threatened to raise prices significantly for consumers. This adjustment may ease trade tensions and affect the US food market.</p>
<p>In foreign affairs, the US president warned Iran against harming protesters amid recent demonstrations and clashes in the country, stating that the US would intervene to protect them. This signals heightened American involvement in Iranian internal matters.</p>
<h2>Other Global Updates</h2>
<p>China's BYD has surpassed Tesla to become the world's largest electric vehicle seller for the first time, marking a shift in the global EV market and reflecting China's growing dominance in this sector.</p>
<p>In West Africa, dozens of people are missing after a boat carrying around 200 migrants sank off the coast of Gambia. This tragic event is part of a dangerous migration route many West Africans travel in hopes of reaching Spain and better opportunities. Efforts to improve safety on these routes remain critical.</p>
<p>Lastly, Anthony Joshua's driver in Nigeria has been charged following a car crash that killed two members of Joshua's team. Joshua was a passenger at the time but was not injured. The incident has prompted legal scrutiny and brought attention to road safety concerns.</p>
