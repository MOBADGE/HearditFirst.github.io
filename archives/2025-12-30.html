    <h2>Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, Russian military losses are increasing at an unprecedented rate, according to data compiled by the BBC from soldiers' obituaries. This rapid rise in casualties underscores the intensity of the conflict. Meanwhile, the US president has expressed hope to swiftly advance to the next phase of a ceasefire in Gaza following discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. He issued a stern warning that the militant group Hamas would face severe consequences if it fails to disarm. In addition, Russia accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on a presidential residence, an allegation Ukraine's President Zelensky vehemently denied, calling it "typical Russian lies."</p>
<h2>US and International Security</h2>
<p>The US president also addressed recent military actions against facilities linked to Venezuelan drug operations, confirming a strike on a "big facility" but stopping short of confirming media reports attributing the explosion to a CIA drone strike. On another front, he downplayed Chinese military drills conducted near Taiwan, which followed the US announcement of an $11 billion arms sale to the island. This suggests a cautious approach amid escalating military posturing in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<h2>Political News from Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Bangladesh mourns the death of Khaleda Zia, the country's first female prime minister, who died at the age of 80. Zia's political career was marked by a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Sheikh Hasina, which shaped the country's political landscape for decades. Zia's passing marks the end of an era in Bangladeshi politics and may influence future political dynamics.</p>
<h2>Accident Involving British Boxer Anthony Joshua</h2>
<p>British heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua was involved in a car crash in Nigeria that resulted in the deaths of two members of his team, who were also close friends. Joshua himself sustained only minor injuries. The incident is a significant personal tragedy and will likely affect Joshua's immediate plans in the sport.</p>
<h2>Environmental Concerns: Mediterranean Sharks</h2>
<p>Researchers warn that great white sharks face extinction in the Mediterranean Sea due to overfishing and illegal fishing practices. This highlights ongoing environmental challenges and the need for stronger protections to preserve marine biodiversity in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Australia, police have reported that the father-and-son gunmen responsible for an attack in Bondi, which killed 15 people, acted alone and had not received weapons training in the Philippines, despite spending a month there. In Spain, Cecilia Giménez, known for her attempt to restore the fresco "Ecce Homo" which famously became nicknamed "Monkey Christ," has died. Her restoration effort brought unexpected fame to the artwork and sparked widespread discussion about art restoration.</p>
