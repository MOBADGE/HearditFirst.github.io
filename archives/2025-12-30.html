    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Russia's losses in Ukraine have increased at an unprecedented rate, as documented by the BBC through analysis of Russian soldiers' obituaries. This rise in casualties highlights the ongoing intensity of the conflict. Meanwhile, tensions remain high around the Gaza conflict. Following talks with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, the US president expressed hope for a quick progression to the next phase of the ceasefire. However, he warned Hamas that failure to disarm would lead to severe consequences.</p>
<p>In Turkey, security forces detained 357 suspected members of the Islamic State group during nationwide raids. These arrests came shortly after a siege in the town of Yalova, where three police officers were killed, underscoring continuing security challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Ukraine and Russia</h2>
<p>Russia accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on the presidential residence of Vladimir Putin. Ukraine denied responsibility, with President Zelensky dismissing the claim as “typical Russian lies.” This incident adds to the heightened tensions and ongoing information disputes between the two countries amid their prolonged conflict.</p>
<h2>Politics and Leadership</h2>
<p>Bangladesh mourns the death of Khaleda Zia, its first female prime minister, who died aged 80. She and Sheikh Hasina, an ousted prime minister, were longtime rivals whose political feud deeply influenced Bangladesh's recent history. Zia’s passing marks the end of a significant chapter in the country’s politics.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>A petition has gathered over 23,000 signatures calling for a national tribute in France to honor film star Brigitte Bardot, who died recently. Bardot was a major cultural figure, and this movement reflects public appreciation for her impact on French cinema.</p>
<p>Also, fans of K-pop are reacting to the breakup of the band NewJeans following a bitter dispute with their record label, Ador. The label has dropped member Danielle Marsh, and it is unclear whether another member, Minji, will return.</p>
<p>In Spain, Cecilia Giménez, who became known worldwide after an infamous failed attempt to restore a fresco nicknamed "Monkey Christ," has died. Her unique contribution to art restoration became a cultural curiosity and tourist attraction.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Research warns that great white sharks face extinction in the Mediterranean Sea. Overfishing and illegal fishing activities are major factors driving this decline, raising concerns about the future of marine biodiversity in the region.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>British heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua survived a car crash in Nigeria that sadly killed two of his team members and close friends. Joshua sustained minor injuries in the accident, which has been a tragic moment for his team and fans.</p>
