    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 30, 2025</div>
    <h2>Protests in Iran Over Currency Collapse</h2>
<p>The Iranian rial reached a record low against the US dollar on Sunday, triggering protests among shopkeepers in Tehran. These demonstrations quickly spread to other areas as people expressed frustration over the declining currency's impact on daily life and the economy. The protests highlight growing economic pressures within Iran, with the falling value of the rial contributing to rising costs and uncertainty for many citizens. The government’s response and whether the unrest will expand further remain important developments to watch.</p>
<h2>Challenges to Russia-Ukraine Peace Prospects</h2>
<p>Efforts to achieve a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine face significant obstacles, notably over territorial control and the status of a major nuclear power plant in Europe, which is currently occupied by Russian forces. These "thorny" issues complicate negotiations and raise concerns about regional security. Meanwhile, the number of Russian soldiers’ deaths in Ukraine is rising rapidly, adding urgency to peace talks. How the parties address these disputes will determine the prospects for reducing conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Major Bank Theft in Germany</h2>
<p>In Germany, police reported a daring theft from a bank branch in Gelsenkirchen during the quiet days after Christmas. Thieves used a drill to break into the high street bank and stole approximately €30 million. Authorities are investigating the heist, which highlights challenges for security in financial institutions, especially during holiday periods. The case remains under active inquiry.</p>
<h2>Aid Restrictions in Gaza Draw Criticism</h2>
<p>Israel announced it will bar 37 aid organizations from operating in Gaza, a move criticized by foreign ministers from ten countries, including the UK. Officials described the new restrictions as "restrictive" and "unacceptable" because of their potential impact on humanitarian access. This decision comes amid ongoing tensions in the region, and its effects on aid delivery in Gaza may further complicate humanitarian efforts.</p>
<h2>Significant Shifts in Middle East Conflict Dynamics</h2>
<p>The United States president expressed hope to quickly reach a second phase of a Gaza ceasefire following talks with Israel’s leader. He also issued a warning that Hamas will face serious consequences if it fails to disarm. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates announced plans to withdraw from Yemen after a Saudi strike on a port controlled by separatists, revealing strains within the alliance fighting against the Houthis. These developments suggest shifting alliances and ongoing volatility in Middle Eastern conflicts.</p>
<h2>Notable Deaths and Arrests</h2>
<p>Bangladesh mourns the death of Khaleda Zia, the country’s first female prime minister, who passed away at age 80. Her long-standing political rivalry with another former prime minister shaped the nation’s political landscape for decades. Meanwhile, Turkey conducted nationwide raids resulting in the detention of 357 people suspected of ties to the Islamic State group, shortly after an attack that killed three police officers. These incidents underscore ongoing political and security challenges in their respective regions.</p>
