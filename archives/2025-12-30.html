    <h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Protests have spread across Iran following the Iranian rial’s record low against the US dollar. The unrest began with shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly expanded, reflecting economic frustrations. Meanwhile, in Gaza, Israel plans to revoke the licenses of 37 aid groups operating in the region. This move has sparked criticism from foreign ministers of 10 countries, including the UK, who described the new restrictions as "restrictive" and "unacceptable." In related news, the US president expressed hopes to quickly advance to a second phase of a ceasefire in Gaza after talks with Israel's Netanyahu, while warning Hamas of severe consequences if it does not disarm.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Negotiations over a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine face significant challenges. Key issues include the status of territories and control over Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, currently held by Russian forces. On the battlefield, Russian military losses in Ukraine are reportedly increasing at the fastest rate since the conflict began. This escalation in casualties comes as international pressure mounts for a peace agreement.</p>
<h2>South Asia Political News</h2>
<p>Bangladesh’s political scene marks a significant moment with the death of Khaleda Zia, the country’s first female prime minister, at the age of 80. Her long-standing rivalry with former prime minister Sheikh Hasina shaped the country’s politics for decades. Her passing may lead to shifts that could impact Bangladesh’s political landscape going forward.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security in Europe</h2>
<p>In Germany, police are investigating a major bank robbery where thieves managed to steal €30 million from a branch in Gelsenkirchen. The heist took place during the quiet period after Christmas, and authorities are assessing how the criminals gained entry and escaped undetected.</p>
<h2>Transport and Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Eurostar services have resumed following disruptions caused by power issues in the Channel Tunnel, but passengers continue to report delays and difficulties. Many travelers have been stranded or forced to seek alternative routes, indicating ongoing operational challenges despite service restoration.</p>
<h2>Cultural News from France</h2>
<p>In France, there is a growing call for a national tribute to Brigitte Bardot, the renowned film star who passed away recently. A petition supporting the homage has attracted over 23,000 signatures, demonstrating broad public interest in honoring her legacy.</p>
