    <h2>Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The United States is actively working toward a ceasefire deal in Gaza, with the US president expressing hope to reach the next phase of the truce "very quickly." He also reinforced a tough stance against Hamas, warning that the group "will have hell to pay" if it does not disarm. This comes amid ongoing tensions in the region and recent diplomatic talks with Israeli leader Netanyahu.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, amid the ongoing conflict with Russia, Russian losses are reportedly rising faster than ever. A BBC investigation tracking Russian soldiers’ obituaries highlights a steep increase in casualties. Russia recently accused Ukraine of a drone attack on a presidential residence, an allegation dismissed by Ukrainian President Zelensky as "typical Russian lies." These developments underscore the continued volatility in Eastern Europe with no immediate resolution in sight.</p>
<h2>Political and Security Developments</h2>
<p>Turkey has detained 357 people suspected of being members of the Islamic State in a series of nationwide raids. This crackdown follows the killing of three police officers during a siege in the town of Yalova. The Turkish authorities’ response indicates heightened security efforts amid terror threats within the country.</p>
<p>In the Asia-Pacific region, tensions remain high as China conducted military drills near Taiwan following the US announcement of an $11 billion arms deal with the island. The US president, however, downplayed the significance of these drills, signaling a relatively calm public stance amid the military displays.</p>
<h2>Notable Deaths</h2>
<p>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, has died at the age of 80. Her long-standing political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina shaped much of the country’s modern political landscape. Zia's death marks the end of an era in Bangladeshi politics.</p>
<p>In Spain, Cecilia Giménez, who gained international attention for her unsuccessful attempt to restore the fresco "Ecce Homo," has passed away. Her restoration effort earned the painting the nickname "Monkey Christ," highlighting an unusual moment in art history that attracted both humor and interest worldwide.</p>
<h2>Environment and Science</h2>
<p>Researchers warn that great white sharks face extinction in the Mediterranean Sea. Overfishing and illegal fishing practices have seriously depleted shark populations, putting one of the ocean’s most iconic predators at risk. This loss could have significant ecological consequences, emphasizing the need for stronger marine conservation measures.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Sports</h2>
<p>The K-pop band NewJeans has broken up following a bitter dispute with their record label, Ador. The label has dropped member Danielle Marsh, while the future of another member, Minji, remains uncertain. This split marks a notable disruption in the popular music scene as fans await further news.</p>
<p>In sports, British heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria. While Joshua himself suffered only minor injuries, two team members who were close friends died in the accident. The incident is a sobering reminder of the risks athletes sometimes face outside their sporting careers.</p>
