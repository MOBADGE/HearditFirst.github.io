    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 30, 2025</div>
    <h2>Middle East and South Asia</h2>
<p>Protests have spread across Iran after the national currency, the rial, hit a record low against the US dollar. The unrest began with shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly expanded. Meanwhile, in Yemen, the United Arab Emirates has announced it will withdraw from the conflict following a Saudi airstrike on a separatist-held port. This move comes amid growing tensions between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who have supported rival factions in the ongoing war against the Houthis.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia, the country’s first female prime minister, has died at the age of 80. Zia was known for her long-standing political rivalry with the ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a feud that shaped much of Bangladesh’s recent political landscape.</p>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>Efforts to negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine face major obstacles related to territorial disputes and control over Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, currently occupied by Russian forces. At the same time, losses for Russia in the conflict are rising sharply. The BBC has documented a significant increase in obituaries for Russian soldiers, marking the conflict’s growing human cost. Meanwhile, the US is actively pushing for a peace agreement.</p>
<h2>Crime and Security</h2>
<p>In Germany, police in Gelsenkirchen reported a high-value bank robbery in which thieves stole €30 million. The attack occurred in the days after Christmas, exploiting a quieter period to break into a busy high street branch. In Turkey, nationwide raids resulted in the detention of 357 individuals suspected of having links to the Islamic State group. These arrests followed a deadly siege in the town of Yalova where three police officers were killed.</p>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p>Eurostar, the operator of cross-Channel train services, has warned passengers about ongoing delays after services resumed following power problems in the Channel Tunnel. Many travelers have been stranded or forced to seek alternative routes, highlighting continuing challenges for this key transport link between the UK and mainland Europe.</p>
<h2>Cultural News</h2>
<p>A petition calling for a national tribute to Brigitte Bardot has gained more than 23,000 signatures since the actress and animal rights activist died on Sunday. Supporters are urging the French government to officially recognize her legacy.</p>
<h2>International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has expressed hope to quickly advance to the second phase of a ceasefire in Gaza. Following talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump warned that Hamas would face severe consequences without disarmament, signaling ongoing efforts to stabilize the region.</p>
