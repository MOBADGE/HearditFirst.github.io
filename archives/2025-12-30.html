    <h2>Protests in Iran Over Currency Collapse</h2>
<p>The Iranian rial hit a record low against the US dollar, causing economic distress that sparked protests in Tehran. Shopkeepers led demonstrations that quickly spread to other areas. The currency's plummet highlights ongoing financial instability in Iran. These protests may continue as citizens express frustration over economic hardships, and the government’s response could influence the country’s social and political situation in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Challenges to Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Efforts to negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine face significant obstacles. Two key issues are the control of certain territories and the fate of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which remains under Russian occupation. These "thorny" topics complicate the peace process, suggesting that progress toward a ceasefire and resolution might be slow and difficult. The international community remains watchful, as outcomes here could affect regional stability.</p>
<h2>Rising Russian Casualties Highlight Conflict Intensity</h2>
<p>BBC documentation shows a recent sharp increase in reported deaths among Russian soldiers in the Ukraine conflict. This surge in fatalities reflects a heightened intensity and cost of the ongoing war. Meanwhile, the United States is pushing for a peace agreement, indicating growing international concern over the war's human toll. The rising losses could influence Russia’s domestic situation and its willingness to engage in negotiations.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns: German Bank Heist and Turkish Anti-IS Raids</h2>
<p>In Germany, thieves used the quieter post-Christmas period to break into a high street bank in Gelsenkirchen, stealing around €30 million. Police are investigating the sophisticated operation, highlighting vulnerabilities even in busy urban centers during holiday slowdowns.</p>
<p>Separately, Turkey conducted nationwide raids resulting in the detention of 357 suspected members of the Islamic State group. These arrests followed a deadly siege in Yalova where three police officers died. These actions underscore ongoing security challenges in the region related to terrorism and law enforcement efforts to counter extremist threats.</p>
<h2>Middle East Dynamics: UAE Plans Yemen Withdrawal and Gaza Ceasefire Talks</h2>
<p>The United Arab Emirates announced plans to withdraw from Yemen following a Saudi strike on a separatist-held port, reflecting strains within the Saudi-UAE alliance in the conflict against Houthi forces. This development could shift the balance of power and efforts toward conflict resolution in Yemen.</p>
<p>In Gaza, US-led diplomacy continues as the US president expressed hope for a speedy move to the next phase of a ceasefire. He also warned that Hamas would face severe consequences if it failed to disarm. These remarks come amid ongoing tensions and efforts to stabilize the region.</p>
<h2>Notable Death and Tributes in South Asia and France</h2>
<p>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, passed away at age 80. Her decades-long political rivalry with Sheikh Hasina significantly shaped Bangladesh’s political landscape. Her death marks the end of an era in the country's politics.</p>
<p>In France, a petition has gathered more than 23,000 signatures calling for a national tribute to film star Brigitte Bardot, who died on Sunday. The move reflects Bardot’s lasting impact on French culture and public life.</p>
