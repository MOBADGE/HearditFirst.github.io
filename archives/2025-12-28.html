    <h2>French Cinema Icons Pass Away</h2>
<p>Two renowned figures in cinema passed away recently. French actress Brigitte Bardot died at age 91. Bardot rose to fame in the 1950s as a symbol of sexual liberation and brought a fresh charm and sensuality to French cinema, reshaping its image. Later in life, she became a controversial figure due to making homophobic and racist remarks. Meanwhile, Iranian filmmaker Bahram Beyzai also died at age 87. He was a significant figure in Iranian cinema, noted for his film *Bashu, the Little Stranger*, which was restored and won an award at this year's Venice Film Festival.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Myanmar</h2>
<p>Myanmar held a widely criticised election amid increasing repression. The polls closed recently on the first day of voting, with observers calling the election a "sham." The vote is seen by many as a move by the military junta to solidify its control over the country. Alongside the election, there has been a renewed crackdown on dissent, raising concerns about the state of democracy and human rights in Myanmar.</p>
<h2>Storms Cause Disruptions Across Nordic Countries</h2>
<p>A major storm swept through parts of Sweden, Finland, and Norway, resulting in three fatalities and widespread power outages affecting thousands of homes. The storm's impact has led to difficult conditions across the region, with emergency services responding to the aftermath. This severe weather event highlights the challenges Nordic countries face during intense winter storms.</p>
<h2>Mount Etna Erupts Again</h2>
<p>Mount Etna, located in Italy, erupted while skiers were on its slopes. Scientists reported increased volcanic activity, with craters continuously emitting ash. This eruption is part of Mount Etna's frequent activity, and monitoring efforts continue as the situation develops. The event attracted attention given its timing during the ski season and the mountain's status as one of Europe's most active volcanoes.</p>
<h2>Security and Health News</h2>
<p>In Italy, police arrested nine individuals accused of raising approximately €7 million over two years to support Hamas, a militant group. Authorities are investigating the network and its fundraising activities. Meanwhile, in Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro is undergoing medical treatment for persistent hiccups that have troubled him for nine months. His wife reported he was already in hospital recovering from hernia surgery. These developments underscore ongoing security concerns in Europe and health challenges affecting notable public figures internationally.</p>
