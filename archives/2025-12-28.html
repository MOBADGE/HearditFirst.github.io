    <div class="date">December 28, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Myanmar has held a widely criticised election that began on Sunday, amid renewed suppression of dissent. Observers view the vote as an effort by the military junta to solidify its control over the country. The election has drawn international concern, as the environment for free political participation remains highly restricted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine’s negotiations with Russia continue to be tense. Ahead of a planned meeting in Florida with Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia "doesn't want peace." Discussions are expected to focus on possible territorial concessions and security guarantees, reflecting the ongoing challenges in seeking a resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>In Italy, nine people were arrested for allegedly raising approximately €7 million (£6 million) for Hamas over more than two years. Authorities are investigating the funding operation aimed at the militant group, highlighting ongoing concerns about financing terrorist activities in Europe.</p>
<h2>Social and Human Rights Issues</h2>
<p>A report from Iran Human Rights (IHR) revealed that executions in Iran have more than doubled in 2025. At least 1,500 executions have been verified up to early December. This sharp increase has drawn international attention to human rights abuses in the country.</p>
<p>In the United States, there has been a record increase in remittances sent back home by Hondurans fearing deportation amid immigration crackdowns under Donald Trump's administration. The surge in money sent to Honduras reflects the anxieties within immigrant communities and the broader impact of shifting US immigration policies.</p>
<h2>Weather and Natural Events</h2>
<p>A major storm has swept across the Nordic countries, resulting in the deaths of two people in Sweden. The storm caused widespread power outages, affecting thousands of homes in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Authorities continue to manage the aftermath as communities work to restore services.</p>
<p>In the United States, New York experienced heavy snowfall that led to significant travel disruptions. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, and over 3,000 were delayed due to the winter storm, challenging residents and travelers alike.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mount Etna in Italy has shown increased volcanic activity this week, with continuous ash emissions from its craters. Skiers were reportedly gliding down snowy slopes as the volcano erupted, reminding observers of the ongoing volcanic risks in the region.</p>
<h2>Maritime Incident</h2>
<p>The Coral Adventurer cruise ship is under investigation after hitting a reef on its first trip since being involved in a tragic incident. The ship had previously left a passenger, Suzanne Rees, stranded on a remote island, where she was later found dead. The investigation aims to determine the circumstances surrounding both events.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Brigitte Bardot, famed for her iconic roles in 1950s cinema, is remembered for bringing a fresh blend of charm and sensuality to the screen during that era. She played a key role in transforming the film industry with her unique style and presence, which helped modernize cinematic culture following the more reserved period before.</p>
