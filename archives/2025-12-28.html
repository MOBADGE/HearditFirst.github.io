    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 28, 2025</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Myanmar held a widely criticized election on December 28, amid accusations that the vote is a sham designed to legitimize the military junta’s grip on power. Observers noted that the election took place alongside a renewed crackdown on dissent throughout the country. This development suggests the junta is aiming to consolidate its authority despite international and domestic opposition.</p>
<p>In related international diplomacy, Volodymyr Zelensky said on the same day that Russia "doesn't want peace" shortly before a meeting in Florida with Donald Trump. The talks are expected to cover contentious issues including territorial concessions and security guarantees. How these discussions progress could have significant implications for ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict involving Russia.</p>
<h2>Security and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Italian authorities arrested nine people accused of raising millions of euros for Hamas over more than two years. The suspects reportedly collected about €7 million (£6 million) to support the militant group. This crackdown highlights ongoing concerns about international funding networks for designated militant organizations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Iran, executions reportedly doubled in 2025 according to the Iran Human Rights group, which verified at least 1,500 executions by early December. The rise in capital punishment underscores continuing human rights concerns in the country.</p>
<h2>Natural Events</h2>
<p>A major storm swept through Nordic countries on December 28, causing the deaths of three people in Sweden and knocking out power to thousands of homes in Sweden, Finland, and Norway. The storm demonstrates the vulnerability of northern European nations to severe weather events during winter months.</p>
<p>In Italy, Mount Etna erupted as skiers enjoyed nearby slopes. Volcanologists noted increased volcanic activity this week, with craters emitting ash continuously. While eruptions are frequent at the site, the timing highlights the intersection of natural hazard and recreational tourism.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>French cinema remembers Brigitte Bardot, described as a revolutionary figure who brought a blend of charm and sensuality that refreshed the industry after the 1950s. Her legacy endures as an icon of cinematic style and social change.</p>
<p>Iranian filmmaker Bahram Beyzai died at 87. His film "Bashu, the Little Stranger" recently received renewed recognition with an award for its restored version at the Venice Film Festival. Beyzai was a major figure in Iranian cinema, and his passing marks the end of an era in the film world.</p>
<h2>Social and Economic Issues</h2>
<p>Remittances from Hondurans in the US to their home country have surged amid fears of deportation linked to an intensified immigration crackdown. Increased cash flows are playing a crucial role in supporting families back in Honduras during an uncertain political and social climate for migrants abroad.</p>
<h2>Maritime Incident</h2>
<p>The cruise ship Coral Adventurer is under investigation after hitting a reef on its first trip following a fatal incident in which a passenger, Suzanne Rees, was left behind on a remote island and later found dead. This incident raises questions about safety and protocols in the cruise industry going forward.</p>
