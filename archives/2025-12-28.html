    <div class="date">December 28, 2025</div>
    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
<p>French actress Brigitte Bardot has died at the age of 91. Bardot was known as a symbol of sexual liberation in the 1950s and played a key role in revitalizing French cinema with her distinctive blend of charm and sensuality. However, later in life, she became a controversial figure due to making homophobic and racist remarks. Her death marks the end of an era for a figure who was both celebrated and criticized.</p>
<h2>Politics in Myanmar</h2>
<p>Myanmar held a highly disputed election amid a renewed government crackdown on dissent. Observers have criticized the vote as a “sham” intended to consolidate the junta’s power rather than reflect the will of the people. These events show continued challenges to democratic processes in the country and signal ongoing political instability.</p>
<h2>Nordic Storms</h2>
<p>A major storm swept across parts of Sweden, Finland, and Norway, resulting in three deaths. Thousands of homes were left without power as the severe weather struck the Nordic region. Recovery and repair efforts are underway, but the scale of the outages highlights how vulnerable infrastructure can be to extreme weather events.</p>
<h2>Crime in Suriname</h2>
<p>Nine people, including five children, were stabbed to death in Suriname in a violent incident. The police have detained a male suspect, who was shot in the leg during the arrest, and two other victims remain seriously injured. This tragic event has shocked the local community and raised concerns about public safety.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement in Italy</h2>
<p>Italian police arrested nine individuals accused of raising around €7 million (£6 million) over two years for Hamas, a militant group. The operation reflects ongoing monitoring and enforcement actions aimed at disrupting financial networks supporting militant activities in Europe.</p>
<h2>Human Rights in Iran</h2>
<p>Executions in Iran are reported to have doubled in 2025, according to the Iran Human Rights group. They have verified at least 1,500 executions up to early December. This sharp increase underscores growing concerns about the use of capital punishment in the country and its human rights implications.</p>
