    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Polls closed on the first day of Myanmar’s national election, which has drawn widespread criticism and is labeled a "sham" by observers. The vote took place amid a renewed crackdown on dissent and is seen as a move by the military junta to solidify its grip on power. Meanwhile, in discussions related to the ongoing conflict involving Russia and Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia is “not interested in peace” ahead of his meeting with Donald Trump in Florida. The talks are expected to focus on potential territorial concessions and security guarantees as part of negotiating efforts.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Weather</h2>
<p>A major storm swept across Nordic countries, causing three deaths in Sweden and leaving thousands of homes without power in parts of Finland, Sweden, and Norway. The storm’s impact on infrastructure and communities highlights ongoing challenges for the region during winter conditions. In Italy, geological activity was notable as Mount Etna erupted with continuous ash emissions. Skiers on the snow-covered slopes witnessed the intensifying volcanic activity, which is common but poses risks to nearby areas.</p>
<h2>Crime and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Italian authorities arrested nine individuals suspected of raising approximately €7 million over a period of more than two years to support Hamas, a militant group. This investigation sheds light on the financial networks linked to militant organizations in Europe. Separately, the Coral Adventurer cruise ship is under investigation following an incident in which a passenger, Suzanne Rees, was left on a remote island and later found dead. The ship also hit a reef during its first trip after the tragic event.</p>
<h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>Two notable figures in international cinema passed away. Brigitte Bardot, the French actress known for symbolizing sexual liberation in the 1950s and later sparking controversy with homophobic and racist remarks, died aged 91. She was credited with revolutionizing French cinema with her unique blend of charm and sensuality. In Iran, Bahram Beyzai, a prominent filmmaker, also died at age 87. His film "Bashu, the Little Stranger," was recently restored and honored at the Venice Film Festival, reflecting his lasting influence on Iranian cinema.</p>
<h2>Human Rights</h2>
<p>A report from Iran Human Rights indicates that executions in Iran have roughly doubled in 2025 compared to previous years, with at least 1,500 verified executions reported by early December. This sharp increase draws international concern over human rights practices in the country and highlights ongoing issues related to the justice system and political climate.</p>
