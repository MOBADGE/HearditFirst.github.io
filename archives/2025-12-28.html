    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 28, 2025</div>
    <h2>Entertainment and Culture</h2>
<p>French cinema has lost a significant figure with the death of actress Brigitte Bardot at the age of 91. Bardot became an iconic symbol of sexual liberation in the 1950s, known for her blend of youthful charm and continental sensuality that helped modernize French cinema during that era. However, her legacy is complicated by her later years, when she attracted controversy due to homophobic and racist remarks. Bardot’s influence on film and culture remains notable, reflecting both transformative and contentious aspects of her public life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Spain, the town of Ibi hosted its annual festival "Els Enfarinats," a traditional event marked by a playful food fight involving flour, eggs, and fireworks. This lively celebration draws attention for its unique cultural expression and community spirit, offering a stark contrast to some of the more serious global events today.</p>
<h2>Global Politics and Conflict</h2>
<p>Myanmar held an election widely criticised as a "sham," amid reports of a harsh crackdown on dissent. Observers view the vote as a move to consolidate the military junta's grip on power rather than a free and fair democratic process. The election's outcome confirms the ongoing challenges faced by the country's pro-democracy forces and the international community's concerns about human rights and governance in Myanmar.</p>
<p>In Italy, authorities arrested nine individuals accused of raising millions of euros for Hamas over more than two years. Police estimate the suspects collected around €7 million (£6 million), highlighting concerns about funding networks supporting militant groups in Europe. These arrests mark a significant step in ongoing efforts to disrupt illicit financial channels linked to terrorism.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Security</h2>
<p>A report by Iran Human Rights (IHR) indicates that executions in Iran have roughly doubled in 2025 compared to previous years, with at least 1,500 executions verified up until early December. This sharp increase underscores continuing international alarm over Iran’s judicial and human rights practices.</p>
<p>In Suriname, a tragic incident unfolded with nine people, including five children, stabbed to death. The police detained a male suspect after shooting him in the leg, while two other individuals remain seriously injured. Authorities continue to investigate the motive and circumstances surrounding this violent event.</p>
<h2>Environment and Weather</h2>
<p>A major storm swept across Nordic countries, including Sweden, Finland, and Norway, causing widespread disruption. Three people lost their lives, and thousands of homes were left without power, demonstrating the significant impact of severe weather on communities in this region. The storm highlights ongoing concerns about climate-related extreme weather events in Northern Europe.</p>
<h2>Travel and Safety</h2>
<p>A cruise ship, the Coral Adventurer, is under investigation after striking a reef on its first trip following a separate incident involving the death of a passenger, Suzanne Rees. Rees was found dead on a remote island where she had been accidentally left behind by the ship. The incident raises questions about safety protocols and responsibility within the cruise industry.</p>
<h2>Health</h2>
<p>Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro has been receiving medical treatment for persistent hiccups that lasted nine months. The 70-year-old was already hospitalized for hernia surgery when the hiccup spasms required additional care. This health matter, while personal, may have wider public interest given Bolsonaro's prominence.</p>
