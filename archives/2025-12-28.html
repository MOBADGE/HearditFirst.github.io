In her later years, she became known for making controversial homophobic and racist comments. Meanwhile, Bahram Beyzai, an influential Iranian cinema figure, died aged 87. His legacy includes the film *Bashu, the Little Stranger*, which was recently honored with an award at the Venice Film Festival following its restoration.</p>
<h2>Myanmar Election Draws Criticism</h2>
