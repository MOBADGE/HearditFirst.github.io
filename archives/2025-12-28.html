    <h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
<p>French cinema icon Brigitte Bardot has died aged 91. Bardot rose to fame in the 1950s as a symbol of sexual liberation, revolutionising French cinema with her distinctive blend of youthful charm and sensuality. Over time, she became a more divisive figure due to her homophobic and racist remarks. Bardot’s influence on film and popular culture remains significant, marking her as one of the most recognizable actresses of her era.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Myanmar</h2>
<p>Polling closed on the first day of Myanmar’s election, which has faced widespread criticism and is described by some observers as a "sham." The vote is accompanied by a renewed crackdown on dissent, raising concerns that the military junta aims to solidify its grip on power rather than facilitate genuine democratic progress. The international community continues to watch closely as the situation unfolds, with questions about the election’s legitimacy and its impact on Myanmar’s political future.</p>
<h2>Storm Causes Disruptions in Nordic Countries</h2>
<p>A major storm swept across parts of Finland, Sweden, and Norway, resulting in three fatalities in Sweden. The severe weather caused widespread power outages, leaving thousands of homes without electricity. Emergency services have been responding to the storm’s impact, as communities in the Nordic region deal with the aftermath and work to restore essential services.</p>
<h2>Violent Attack in Suriname</h2>
<p>Nine people, including five children, were stabbed to death in Suriname in an incident that left two others seriously injured. Police have detained a male suspect, who was shot in the leg during the arrest. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the motive and circumstances surrounding this tragic event.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement Actions in Europe</h2>
<p>Italian police have arrested nine people suspected of raising around €7 million for Hamas over more than two years. Authorities are investigating the funding network supporting the militant group. Meanwhile, Iran has reportedly seen a significant rise in executions in 2025, with the Iran Human Rights group verifying at least 1,500 executions up to December, indicating a doubling compared to previous years.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Brazilian figure Jair Bolsonaro is undergoing medical treatment for persistent hiccups that lasted nine months. Bolsonaro was already hospitalized for hernia surgery when the hiccups reportedly began. In maritime news, the cruise ship Coral Adventurer is under investigation after it struck a reef on its first trip since being implicated in a case where passenger Suzanne Rees was found dead on a remote island after being left behind. The circumstances surrounding her death are still being examined.</p>
<h2>Cultural Tradition in Spain</h2>
<p>In lighter news, the Spanish town of Ibi hosted its annual food fight festival "Els Enfarinats," where locals and participants engage in throwing flour, eggs, and fireworks.
