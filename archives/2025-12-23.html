    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>US Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>New information has emerged about former US president Donald Trump's connections to Jeffrey Epstein, a late convicted sex offender. A US prosecutor disclosed that Trump traveled on Epstein's plane more frequently than previously known. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Additionally, Trump announced that the US government will either keep or sell oil seized from Venezuela, along with plans to retain tankers intercepted off the Venezuelan coast. These developments highlight ongoing legal and geopolitical issues surrounding Trump and US foreign policy.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russian forces have captured the town of Siversk in eastern Ukraine. This advance brings Russia closer to controlling the last cities in the "fortress belt" region of Donetsk still held by Ukraine. The capture is significant as it marks continued pressure on Ukraine's eastern front during the ongoing conflict, potentially impacting future military and diplomatic developments in the region.</p>
<h2>Libya Military Leadership</h2>
<p>Libya’s army chief, General Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad, died in an air crash in Turkey. The plane, which took off from Ankara with the general and four others onboard, lost signal before the crash. This sudden death may have implications for Libya’s military stability and political landscape as the country continues to navigate complex internal conflicts.</p>
<h2>US Economy Shows Strength</h2>
<p>The US economy grew at its fastest rate in two years, driven by strong consumer spending. This economic growth exceeded expectations, suggesting resilience in consumer demand and potential positive momentum as the year closes. The faster growth rate could influence future economic policies and business confidence.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>Several crises are unfolding globally with serious humanitarian implications. In Nigeria, gunmen abducted 28 Muslim travellers, including women and children, who were en route to a religious festival. In the Great Lakes region, thousands fleeing violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo are facing dire conditions in Burundi, with children and pregnant women among the most vulnerable, some going without food for days. These events underscore ongoing challenges related to security and humanitarian assistance in these areas.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>An officer shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi has returned home from the hospital, a recovery his family describes as a "miracle." In Texas, a tragic plane crash claimed five lives, including those on a Mexican Navy plane transporting a child burn victim to the US for medical care. Meanwhile, Israel extended a legal order granting the government authority to close foreign broadcasters considered security threats, a measure initially introduced during the Gaza war. This reflects ongoing tensions affecting media freedom in the region.</p>
