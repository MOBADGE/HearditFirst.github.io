    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>Public Safety and Tragedies</h2>
<p>Jack Hibbert, a police officer who was shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, has returned home for Christmas. His family described his recovery and homecoming as a "miracle." Meanwhile, several tragic accidents occurred recently: a Mexican Navy plane crashed in Texas while transporting a child burn victim to the United States on behalf of a charity, killing all five aboard. In Laos, a ferry sank on the Mekong River, causing panic among tourists and resulting in the deaths of a local woman and two children, with others rescued from the disaster.</p>
<h2>US Policy and Military Developments</h2>
<p>The United States is intensifying actions regarding Venezuelan oil shipments, with the president announcing the pursuit of a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela, following a recent blockade on sanctioned tankers. Additionally, plans for a new "Golden Fleet" of battleships, named after the president himself, were unveiled. This initiative aims to revive American shipbuilding and counterbalance China's naval expansion.</p>
<h2>Technology and Security</h2>
<p>Amazon has blocked 1,800 job applications it identified as attempts by suspected North Korean agents to gain remote working IT positions using stolen or fake identities. In a related technology note, innovative methods such as showers and baths are being explored to cool large data centres more efficiently and sustainably, addressing environmental challenges associated with expanding digital infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Health and Medicine</h2>
<p>The US regulator approved the first pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy. This marks a significant shift in obesity treatment by offering an oral alternative to previous injectables, potentially expanding access and ease of use for patients seeking weight management options.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Politics</h2>
<p>Vince Zampella, co-creator of the popular Call of Duty video game series, died in a car crash in California when his vehicle caught fire on a highway in Los Angeles. In political news, the recent release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein has drawn little public reaction from conservative influencers despite ongoing implications. The documents continue to pose potential political risks for the current US president and his supporters.</p>
