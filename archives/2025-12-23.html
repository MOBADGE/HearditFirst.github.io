    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across multiple regions of Ukraine on December 23. The strikes targeted several cities, resulting in power outages affecting many areas. Three people have died due to the attacks. This escalation in hostilities comes amid ongoing tensions and has caused disruptions to infrastructure and civilian life.</p>
<h2>United States and Venezuela Oil Disputes</h2>
<p>The US president announced plans to retain or sell oil that American forces seized from Venezuela. In addition to the oil, the US also intends to keep several tankers intercepted off Venezuela's coast. These actions underscore continuing disputes over resources and influence in the region.</p>
<h2>New Weight-Loss Drug Approval</h2>
<p>The US regulatory body approved a new pill form of the Wegovy weight-loss drug. This marks a shift from existing injectable weight-loss treatments, making the medication more accessible and potentially more appealing to patients seeking easier options for weight management.</p>
<h2>Tragedies in Texas and Laos</h2>
<p>A Mexican Navy plane crashed in Texas, killing five people. The aircraft was transporting a child burn victim to the US for charity care when the accident occurred. Separately, a ferry sank on the Mekong River in Laos, causing panic among tourists and locals. At least one local woman and two children are feared dead in the disaster, highlighting ongoing transportation safety risks in the region.</p>
<h2>Security Measures and Technology</h2>
<p>In response to security concerns, Israel’s parliament extended a law that allows the government to close foreign broadcasters considered threats during the Gaza conflict. Meanwhile, Amazon reported blocking 1,800 job applications from individuals suspected to be North Korean agents. These applicants used stolen or fake identities to seek remote IT jobs, according to Amazon’s chief security officer.</p>
<h2>Notable Death and Naval Plans</h2>
<p>Vince Zampella, co-creator of the popular Call of Duty video game series, died in a car crash and fire in Los Angeles. On another front, the US president announced plans to revive American shipbuilding by creating a "Golden Fleet" of battleships named after himself. This is part of efforts to strengthen the US naval presence amid competition with China.</p>
