    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across multiple Ukrainian cities, resulting in the deaths of three people. The strikes caused widespread power outages in several regions, further disrupting daily life in the country. This escalation reflects the ongoing tensions and violence in Ukraine, with impacts on civilian infrastructure and security. The situation remains unstable and could lead to additional humanitarian challenges.</p>
<h2>U.S. and Venezuela Oil Seizures</h2>
<p>The US president announced that oil seized from Venezuela will either be kept or sold by the United States. Additionally, the US plans to retain tankers intercepted off the Venezuelan coast. These actions highlight ongoing tensions related to Venezuelan oil and maritime enforcement, with implications for US-Venezuela relations and international maritime law.</p>
<h2>Israeli Media Regulation</h2>
<p>Israel’s parliament passed a bill extending temporary powers that allow the closure of foreign broadcasters deemed security threats. These powers were initially introduced during the Gaza war and now have been expanded. This legislative move indicates continued government efforts to regulate foreign media under national security justifications, potentially affecting press freedom and the flow of information.</p>
<h2>Advances in Weight-Loss Medication</h2>
<p>A new development in medicine came with the approval of Wegovy in pill form by a US regulator. Wegovy is the first pill weight-loss drug of its kind to gain approval, marking a shift from injectable to oral medication for weight management. This change could make weight-loss treatment more accessible and easier to use for many people.</p>
<h2>Tragic Accidents and Disasters</h2>
<p>Two major tragedies have been reported recently. In Texas, a plane carrying a child burns victim crashed, resulting in five deaths. The plane was operated by the Mexican Navy and was transporting the child on behalf of a charity caring for burn victims. Separately, a ferry sank on the Mekong River in Laos, causing panic among passengers. A local woman and two children are believed to have died in the incident as people struggled to escape the sinking vessel. Both events have caused heartbreak and highlight ongoing safety concerns in transportation.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>- Jack Hibbert, a police officer who was shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, has returned home from the hospital, with family describing the recovery as a “miracle.”  
- The US president revealed plans to rebuild American naval capacity with new battleships called the "Golden Fleet," named after himself, aiming to catch up with China.  
- Vince Zampella, a co-creator of the Call of Duty video game series, died in a car crash in California when his vehicle caught fire.  
- Amazon reported blocking 1,800 job applications suspected to come from North Korean agents using stolen or fake identities, targeting remote IT positions.</p>
<p>These developments reflect ongoing concerns about public safety, technological security, and geopolitical competition.</p>
