    <h2>US Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump has admitted to travelling on planes owned by late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein more times than previously disclosed. This remark comes amid long-standing denials from Trump regarding any wrongdoing connected to Epstein. The revelation adds to ongoing scrutiny around Epstein’s network and the extent of its connections.</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump stated that the US will retain or sell oil and tankers it has seized from Venezuela. He confirmed the intention to keep control of these tankers intercepted off Venezuela’s coast, signaling continued tensions in US-Venezuelan relations and impacting regional oil dynamics.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Eastern Europe</h2>
<p>In Ukraine, government forces have suffered a significant setback with the loss of the town of Siversk in the Donetsk region. The fall of this embattled eastern town brings Russian forces closer to capturing the last remaining “fortress belt” cities under Ukrainian control in the area. This development marks a critical shift on the ground and may influence the broader trajectory of the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<h2>International Incidents and Crises</h2>
<p>Tragedy struck in Libya when General Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad, the army chief, was killed in a plane crash in Turkey. The jet, carrying al-Haddad and four others, disappeared shortly after taking off from Ankara. The loss is likely to impact Libya’s military leadership and internal security situation.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, 28 Muslim travellers including women and children were abducted by gunmen in central regions while en route to a religious festival. The attack highlights ongoing security challenges in the country’s central areas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands fleeing violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo have arrived in Burundi, facing dire conditions. Aid agencies report that vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnant women, are going days without adequate food and medical care, underscoring a growing humanitarian crisis.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns in Iran</h2>
<p>UN experts have called for Iran to halt the execution of Zahra Tabari, a 67-year-old woman activist sentenced to death after a trial reportedly lasting less than 10 minutes. The case has drawn international attention and concern over due process and human rights protections in Iran.</p>
<h2>US Economy and Recovery</h2>
<p>The US economy expanded at its fastest pace in two years, supported primarily by strong consumer spending. This growth exceeded expectations, offering signs of resilience amid global economic uncertainties. The positive economic data may influence future policy decisions and market sentiments.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>In Australia, police officer Jack Hibbert, who was seriously injured when shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, has made a remarkable recovery. Returning home this Christmas has been described by his family as a “miracle,” emphasizing the personal impact behind headline events.</p>
<p>In Texas, five people died after a plane carrying a child burns victim crashed. The Mexican Navy plane was transporting the child to the US as part of a charity’s care program for burns victims, making the accident particularly tragic.</p>
