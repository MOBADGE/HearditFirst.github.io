    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>US Political and Legal News</h2>
<p>A US prosecutor stated that former US president Donald Trump traveled on the private plane of Jeffrey Epstein, a late convicted sex offender, more frequently than had been previously disclosed. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing or improper association with Epstein. This development adds new context to ongoing scrutiny of Trump’s connections with Epstein, though no further details about legal implications have been provided.</p>
<p>In related US news, Trump also announced that the US government will keep or sell oil that was seized from Venezuela. Additionally, he said tankers intercepted off the coast of Venezuela will remain in US possession. This signals a firm stance by the US on controlling Venezuelan oil resources amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ukrainian forces lost control of the eastern town of Siversk after Russian capture, marking a significant gain for Russia in the Donetsk region. The fall of Siversk brings Russian forces closer to taking over the last “fortress belt” cities held by Ukraine in this area. This development underscores continued intense fighting and territorial shifts in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<h2>International Security and Crises</h2>
<p>In Libya, contact has been lost with a jet carrying General Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad, who leads the Libyan army, along with four others. The aircraft took off from Ankara, Turkey, on Tuesday evening before communication was lost. The circumstances surrounding this incident remain unclear and may have implications for security and military stability in the region.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, gunmen abducted 28 Muslim travelers, including women and children, as they were traveling to a religious festival. Such attacks reflect ongoing security challenges in central Nigeria, especially involving vulnerable civilian populations during periods of travel and religious observance.</p>
<p>Aid agencies are reporting dire conditions for thousands fleeing violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo into neighboring Burundi. Among those most affected are children and pregnant women, some of whom have gone without food for days. This humanitarian situation highlights the ongoing impact of conflict in the Congo region and the urgent need for relief efforts.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The US economy grew at its fastest pace in two years, driven largely by strong consumer spending. This growth exceeded previous expectations and points to continued economic resilience. How long this momentum will last remains a topic of interest for economists and policymakers as they monitor inflation and other financial factors.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Australia, police officer Jack Hibbert, who was severely injured after being shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, has returned home for Christmas. His family described his recovery and homecoming as a “miracle,” highlighting the positive outcome after a critical injury.</p>
<p>In Texas, a plane crash resulted in five deaths, including a child burn victim. The Mexican Navy plane was transporting the child to the US for charitable medical care when it crashed. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident.</p>
<p>In Israel, parliament passed a bill extending temporary powers allowing the closure of foreign broadcasters perceived as security threats. These measures, initially introduced during the Gaza war, give the government increased authority to shutter media outlets on security grounds.</p>
