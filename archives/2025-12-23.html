    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>Law Enforcement and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Jack Hibbert, a police officer who was shot twice during an attack in Bondi, including a gunshot to the head, has returned home from the hospital. His family called this recovery a "miracle." The shooting incident had raised concerns about officer safety and the risks law enforcement personnel face daily. His return home brings a hopeful update after what was a serious injury.</p>
<h2>US-Venezuela Relations and Energy Policy</h2>
<p>The US president announced plans to keep or sell oil tankers and cargo seized from Venezuela. This includes retentions of tankers intercepted off the Venezuelan coast. The decision signals continued US engagement in the region and shapes ongoing economic and diplomatic relations with Venezuela, especially in the context of energy resources and maritime security.</p>
<h2>Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Advances</h2>
<p>The US regulator has approved a pill form of the weight-loss drug Wegovy, marking a significant change in how such medications are administered. Previously available only as injections, this new format could make weight-loss treatments more accessible and convenient for patients. This development may influence future drug formulations and obesity treatment approaches.</p>
<h2>International Tragedies and Disasters</h2>
<p>Two tragic accidents have occurred recently. In Texas, a Mexican Navy plane carrying a child burn victim for treatment in the US crashed and resulted in five deaths. Separately, a ferry disaster on the Mekong River in Laos caused panic among tourists and locals, with a local woman and two children feared dead. Rescue efforts were ongoing in Laos, highlighting issues of transportation safety in the area.</p>
<h2>Technology and Security</h2>
<p>Amazon announced it blocked 1,800 job applications suspected to be from North Korean agents attempting to secure remote IT positions using stolen or fake identities. This incident underscores ongoing cyber and security challenges for global tech companies, particularly in vetting applicants and safeguarding sensitive digital environments.</p>
<h2>Naval Industry and Military Plans</h2>
<p>The US president unveiled a plan to rebuild the nation’s naval capacity by creating a so-called "Golden Fleet" of battleships named after himself. The initiative aims to revitalize American shipbuilding, which has fallen behind China in recent years. This plan reflects broader efforts to enhance military capacity and assert naval strength.</p>
<h2>Technology Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Cooling large data centers remains a significant environmental and technical challenge. Innovative methods, including the use of showers and baths to cool computing equipment, are being explored to make data centers greener. As demand for data processing grows, finding sustainable cooling solutions is key to reducing the carbon footprint of digital infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Cultural Note</h2>
<p>Vince Zampella, co-creator of the popular video game series Call of Duty, died in a car crash in Los Angeles. His passing marks the loss of an influential figure in the video game industry known for his creative contributions.</p>
