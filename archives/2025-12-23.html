    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across several cities in Ukraine, resulting in at least three deaths. The strikes caused significant damage to infrastructure, leaving multiple regions without power. This escalation adds to the ongoing conflict and raises concerns about further instability in the region.</p>
<h2>US Policy on Venezuela Oil</h2>
<p>The US president announced plans to either keep or sell oil and tankers seized off the coast of Venezuela. This move signals a firm stance on Venezuelan assets collected by the US and could impact relations between the two countries, as well as global oil markets.</p>
<h2>Israeli Media Regulation</h2>
<p>Israel’s parliament passed a bill extending powers introduced during the Gaza conflict to shut down foreign broadcasters deemed security threats. This legislation expands temporary authority to regulate media outlets, reflecting heightened security concerns in the region.</p>
<h2>Advances in Weight-Loss Treatment</h2>
<p>A US regulator approved the first-ever pill form of the weight-loss drug Wegovy. Previously available only as injections, this new form could make treatment more accessible and convenient for people managing obesity, potentially influencing healthcare approaches to weight management.</p>
<h2>Tragic Travel Incidents</h2>
<p>Two separate accidents resulted in multiple deaths this week. In Texas, a Mexican Navy plane crashed while transporting a child burns patient to the US, killing five people onboard. Meanwhile, a ferry disaster on the Mekong River in Laos caused panic as tourists scrambled for safety; a local woman and two children are feared dead. Both incidents highlight ongoing risks in transportation and emergency response challenges.</p>
<h2>Technology and Security</h2>
<p>Amazon reported blocking 1,800 job applications suspected to be from North Korean agents attempting to secure remote IT jobs using stolen or fake identities. This revelation underscores continuing cybersecurity threats related to state-backed actors targeting global tech companies.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Vince Zampella, co-creator of the popular video game Call of Duty, died in a car crash in Los Angeles. His passing marks a significant loss in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>The US president also announced plans to revitalize the American naval shipbuilding sector, including creating a "Golden Fleet" of battleships named after himself. This initiative aims to restore US naval prominence, especially in competition with China.</p>
