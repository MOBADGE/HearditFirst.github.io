    <h2>US Politics and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>New information has emerged regarding former US president Donald Trump's travel on a plane owned by the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A US prosecutor has stated that Trump traveled on Epstein's plane more frequently than was previously known. Trump has long denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein. In a separate statement, Trump said the US will keep or sell oil seized from Venezuela and also intends to retain the tankers intercepted off the Venezuelan coast. These developments continue to keep Trump in the public eye amidst ongoing legal and political scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>The eastern Ukrainian town of Siversk has been captured by Russian forces, according to recent reports. This victory brings Russia closer to controlling the last remaining cities still held by Ukraine in the Donetsk region’s so-called "fortress belt." The loss marks a significant moment in the ongoing conflict, as control over these strategic areas is critical for both sides. The situation remains fluid, with the potential for further shifts in territory and impact on the broader regional conflict.</p>
<h2>International Incidents and Security Concerns</h2>
<p>In Turkey, Libya’s army chief Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad was killed in a plane crash along with four others. The aircraft lost contact shortly after departing Ankara, raising concerns about the circumstances of the crash and its potential impact on Libya’s military leadership.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, 28 Muslim travelers, including women and children, were abducted by gunmen while en route to a religious festival. The attack highlights continuing security challenges in central Nigeria.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Crises</h2>
<p>Aid agencies report dire conditions for thousands of people fleeing violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo who have taken refuge in neighboring Burundi. The most vulnerable among them, including children and pregnant women, are facing food shortages and harsh conditions as they await assistance.</p>
<h2>US Economy</h2>
<p>The US economy expanded at its fastest rate in two years, driven by strong consumer spending. This growth exceeded expectations and indicates continued economic resilience. The economic performance may influence policy decisions and market confidence going into the new year.</p>
<h2>Additional News</h2>
<p>- In Israel, parliament has extended a bill that allows the government to close foreign broadcasters temporarily. These powers were initially introduced during the Gaza war to shutter outlets considered security threats.</p>
<p>- In Texas, five people died after a Mexican Navy plane crashed. The aircraft was transporting a child who was being cared for by a charity specializing in burns victims.</p>
<p>- In Australia, police officer Jack Hibbert, who was shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, has made a remarkable recovery and returned home for Christmas. His family called his recovery a "miracle."</p>
