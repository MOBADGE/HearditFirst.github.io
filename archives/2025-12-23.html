    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Fighting has intensified in the Ukrainian region of Odesa, with Russia escalating attacks. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said the assaults aim to block Ukraine’s access to maritime routes, which are essential for the country’s logistics and trade. This escalation underscores ongoing tensions in the region and could impact Ukraine’s economy and the flow of goods through the Black Sea.</p>
<h2>US Advances in Weight-Loss Medication</h2>
<p>The US regulator has approved the pill form of Wegovy, making it the first of its kind in the weight-loss drug category. Previously available only as an injection, Wegovy’s new oral form could make it more accessible and convenient for people seeking medical assistance to manage their weight. This approval may mark a shift in how obesity and related conditions are treated.</p>
<h2>US-Venezuela Oil Tanker Actions</h2>
<p>The US president announced that the country is pursuing a third oil tanker linked to Venezuela following recent orders to block sanctioned tankers from entering or leaving Venezuelan ports. This move is part of a broader US effort to enforce sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and pressure the Venezuelan government. It represents increased US intervention in regional energy supplies and geopolitical relations.</p>
<h2>Human Interest: Officer Recovers After Shooting</h2>
<p>Jack Hibbert, a police officer who was shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, Australia, has returned home for Christmas. His family described the recovery and homecoming as a "miracle." Hibbert’s case highlights challenges faced by law enforcement and the significance of community and family support in healing after violent incidents.</p>
<h2>Security Concerns in Tech Industry</h2>
<p>Amazon reported blocking 1,800 job applications from individuals suspected to be North Korean agents. According to Amazon’s chief security officer, these applicants attempted to secure remote IT jobs using stolen or fake identities. This development highlights ongoing cybersecurity threats and the lengths that state-backed actors may go to infiltrate technology companies.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
