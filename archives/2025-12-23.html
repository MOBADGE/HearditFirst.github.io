    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia launched a large-scale attack across multiple cities in Ukraine, involving missile and drone strikes. The attacks caused widespread power outages in several regions and resulted in three deaths. This escalation adds to ongoing tensions in the area, impacting civilian infrastructure and raising concerns about further violence.</p>
<h2>US Politics and Military Developments</h2>
<p>The US president announced plans to keep or sell oil seized from Venezuela, along with intentions to retain tankers intercepted near Venezuelan waters. Additionally, he unveiled a proposal to revive American shipbuilding, aiming to improve naval capacity through a new fleet of battleships named the "Golden Fleet," named after himself. These moves reflect a focus on asserting US influence in energy resources and military strength.</p>
<h2>Israel Expands Media Restrictions</h2>
<p>Israel's parliament passed a bill extending powers first introduced during conflict with Gaza, allowing temporary closure of foreign broadcasters judged to be security threats. This measure broadens the government’s ability to limit media operations amid ongoing security concerns, affecting the media landscape in the region.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Tragedies</h2>
<p>A Mexican Navy plane carrying a child burn victim to the US crashed in Texas, killing all five on board. The child was being transported as part of charity efforts supporting burn victims. Separately, a ferry disaster on the Mekong River in Laos caused panic as tourists scrambled to safety; a local woman and two children are feared dead.</p>
<h2>Health and Technology Updates</h2>
<p>The US regulator approved a new pill form of the weight-loss drug Wegovy. This marks a shift in weight-loss treatments, as Wegovy becomes the first drug of its kind approved in pill form rather than injections, potentially increasing accessibility for patients.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In California, Vince Zampella, a co-creator of the popular video game Call of Duty, died in a car crash on a Los Angeles highway after his vehicle caught fire. Meanwhile, Amazon blocked about 1,800 job applications suspected to be from North Korean agents attempting to secure remote IT positions using stolen or fake identities, signaling increased cybersecurity vigilance by private companies.</p>
<h2>Injury Recovery Story</h2>
<p>Jack Hibbert, a police officer who survived a gunshot to the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, has gone home from the hospital. His family described his recovery as a "miracle," highlighting a positive outcome amid the year-end news cycle.</p>
