    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Libya's army chief, Gen Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad, died in an air crash in Turkey after losing signal shortly following takeoff from Ankara. The incident also involved four other people on board. Meanwhile, in eastern Ukraine, Russia has captured the town of Siversk, bringing it closer to seizing the remaining Ukrainian-controlled cities in the Donetsk region's "fortress belt." These developments mark significant escalations in ongoing conflicts in both Libya and Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns</h2>
<p>United Nations experts are calling on Iran to halt the execution of Zahra Tabari, a 67-year-old woman activist. Her family reports that her trial lasted less than 10 minutes before she was sentenced to death. This case has drawn international attention as part of broader concerns about the treatment of political activists in Iran.</p>
<p>At the same time, in central Nigeria, 28 Muslim travelers—including women and children—were abducted by gunmen while en route to a religious festival. The incident highlights ongoing security challenges and risks faced by civilians in parts of Nigeria.</p>
<h2>US Economy and Political Developments</h2>
<p>The US economy has grown at its fastest pace in two years, supported by strong consumer spending that exceeded expectations. This economic growth comes amid ongoing political developments related to former president Trump. He stated the US will keep or sell oil seized from Venezuela and plans to retain intercepted tankers off Venezuela's coast. In recent days, newly released Epstein files included emails referencing Ghislaine Maxwell, but conservative political influencers have remained notably quiet, even as potential political risks remain for Trump.</p>
<h2>Domestic News</h2>
<p>In Australia, police officer Jack Hibbert, who survived being shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, has returned home for Christmas. His family described the recovery and return as a "miracle," highlighting a rare positive development amid troubling violence.</p>
<h2>Regional Relations</h2>
<p>Tensions between India and Bangladesh have intensified after recent deadly protests in Bangladesh. These events have further strained the already fragile relations between Delhi and Dhaka, complicating diplomatic efforts in the region.</p>
