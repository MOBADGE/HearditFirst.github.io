    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 23, 2025</div>
    <h2>Law Enforcement and Public Safety</h2>
<p>Jack Hibbert, a police officer who was shot in the head and shoulder during an attack in Bondi, has made a remarkable recovery and returned home for Christmas. His family described his homecoming as a "miracle," highlighting the seriousness of his injuries and the hopeful progress in his recovery.</p>
<p>In another tragic incident, a plane carrying a child burns victim crashed in Texas, resulting in five deaths. The Mexican Navy aircraft was transporting the child to the US on behalf of a charity dedicated to caring for burn victims.</p>
<h2>International Affairs and Security</h2>
<p>The Israeli parliament has passed a bill extending temporary powers introduced during the Gaza war. These expanded powers allow the government to shutter foreign broadcasters considered a security threat. This move reflects ongoing concerns about information and media during times of conflict.</p>
<p>In related international security news, Amazon disclosed it had blocked 1,800 job applications suspected to be from North Korean agents. These applicants tried to secure remote IT jobs using stolen or fake identities, according to Amazon’s chief security officer.</p>
<h2>US Political and Military Developments</h2>
<p>The US president announced plans to keep or sell oil and tankers seized off the coast of Venezuela. This statement signals the US’s intention to maintain control over assets intercepted during operations near Venezuela.</p>
<p>Additionally, the president unveiled a plan to revive American shipbuilding with a new "Golden Fleet" of battleships named after himself. This initiative aims to boost the US naval capacity, which officials say has fallen behind China’s growing fleet.</p>
<h2>Health and Technology Advances</h2>
<p>The US regulator has approved a pill form of the weight-loss drug Wegovy. This marks the first approval of its kind, as Wegovy had previously been available only as an injection. The pill option may offer a more convenient choice for people seeking weight-loss treatments.</p>
<h2>Accidents and Disasters</h2>
<p>A ferry sank on the Mekong River in Laos, causing panic and screams as tourists scrambled to safety. The incident resulted in at least three people feared dead, including a local woman and two children. Rescue efforts are ongoing as authorities assess the disaster's full impact.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Culture</h2>
<p>Vince Zampella, co-creator of the popular video game Call of Duty, died following a car crash and fire on a Los Angeles highway. He was recognized as an influential figure in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>In political news related to media scrutiny, the latest release of Epstein files did not produce significant public reaction from conservative influencers. However, some analysts suggest there may still be political risks for the US president linked to the documents.</p>
