    <div class="date">February 20, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a limited military strike on Iran, according to recent statements. This threat comes shortly after he gave Iran approximately ten days to agree to a deal aimed at curbing its nuclear program. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued a ruling that limits the authority to impose tariffs, which weakens Trump’s ability to manage international trade issues if he pursues a second term. These developments may impact U.S. foreign policy and international negotiations going forward.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>NASA aims to send humans back around the Moon in early March, targeting the Artemis II mission launch after completing a successful "wet dress rehearsal," a key pre-launch test. This mission represents a significant step in lunar exploration and could pave the way for further human space travel beyond Earth’s orbit.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime News</h2>
<p>In Cameroon, three soldiers have been sentenced to prison for the killing of 21 civilians in the country’s Anglophone region. The prison sentences are rare in this conflict-ridden area, marking an unusual instance of accountability.</p>
<p>In Austria, a climber has been found guilty following the death of his girlfriend from hypothermia during a mountain trip on Grossglockner in January 2025. The case highlights risks associated with extreme mountain climbing.</p>
<p>In France, a soldier died after being shot in the head during a “game” with fellow soldiers, which involves attempting to disarm one another. Authorities are investigating the incident as an accident linked to military practices.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has been released after nearly nine months in prison, following the passage of an amnesty law. His release could affect political dynamics within the country.</p>
<p>In India, a mother and her infant were tragically burnt to death after a mob accused the woman of practising witchcraft. The incident draws attention to ongoing issues related to superstition and mob violence in certain communities.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of the online fashion retailer Asos, has died after falling from an apartment block in Thailand. Griffiths had left Asos in 2005 but remained a significant shareholder.</p>
<p>In Italy’s city of Catania, authorities reported that a dog was purposely trained to illegally dump rubbish. The city condemned these actions, emphasizing that creative methods should not be used as excuses for antisocial behavior.</p>
