    <h2>International Politics</h2>
<p>Former US leader Donald Trump has faced a setback as the Supreme Court ruled against his approach to imposing tariffs on other countries. This ruling weakens Trump's ability to unilaterally manage trade relations through tariffs, which was a key part of his plans for a potential second term. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East remain high as Trump announced that the world has "10 days" to see if Iran agrees to a nuclear deal. The United States is sending additional forces to the region amid ongoing negotiations with Iran, signaling increased pressure on the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>Nasa has set a target to launch humans around the Moon in early March, moving forward with the Artemis II mission. This follows a successful "wet dress rehearsal," a critical practice involving fueling the rocket and simulating launch conditions. The mission aims to advance human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit, marking an important step toward future lunar exploration and possibly supporting long-term goals such as a sustainable human presence on the Moon.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime News</h2>
<p>In Cameroon, three soldiers received rare prison sentences for the killing of 21 civilians in the Anglophone region, an area experiencing ongoing conflict. This marks an uncommon instance of accountability for military personnel involved in violence against civilians. In Austria, a climber was found guilty after his girlfriend died of hypothermia during a trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025. The case highlights the potential dangers of extreme sports and the legal consequences following such tragedies.</p>
<h2>Tragic Incidents</h2>
<p>A French soldier died after being accidentally shot in the head during a so-called "game" among soldiers, which involved trying to disarm colleagues and disable their weapons. Authorities are investigating the incident, which reveals risks associated with military practices even outside combat. In India, a mother and her infant were burnt to death by a mob amid accusations of witchcraft. Eyewitnesses reported that rumors led to the attack, underscoring ongoing issues of violence fueled by superstition in some regions.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Stories</h2>
<p>Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of online clothing retailer Asos, died after falling from an apartment block in Thailand. Griffiths helped start the company in 2000 and remained an important shareholder until after 2005. In Italy, authorities reported a dog trained to illegally dump rubbish, prompting a statement from the city of Catania that warned against using "ingenuity" as an excuse for uncivil behavior. This unusual story highlights local efforts to combat environmental violations using creative but problematic methods.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>Juan Pablo Guanipa, a Venezuelan opposition politician, was released after nearly nine months in prison. His release came following the passage of an amnesty law, reflecting ongoing political shifts and attempts to ease tensions within Venezuela's polarized political landscape.</p>
