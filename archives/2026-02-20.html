    <h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>Nasa is preparing to send humans back around the Moon with the Artemis II mission, targeting an early March 2026 launch. This follows a successful "wet dress rehearsal" test, in which the rocket and spacecraft systems were tested fully fueled. The mission is an important step in advancing human space exploration beyond Earth’s orbit and could pave the way for future crewed lunar landings.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions in the Middle East remain high as the US increases its military presence amid ongoing negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. Former US leader Donald Trump warned that the world has 10 days to see if Iran agrees to a deal, cautioning that "bad things" could happen otherwise. The situation underscores the fragility of diplomatic efforts and the risks of conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>In Cameroon, a rare legal development saw three soldiers sentenced to prison for the killing of 21 civilians in the country's troubled Anglophone region. Such accountability is uncommon in the conflict zone and may signal a shift toward addressing human rights abuses. Meanwhile, in Austria, a climber was found guilty after his girlfriend died of hypothermia during a trip on Grossglockner mountain in 2025, highlighting the risks involved in extreme sports and questions of responsibility.</p>
<h2>Politics and Human Rights</h2>
<p>Venezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa was released after almost nine months in prison, following the passage of an amnesty law. His release may have implications for Venezuela’s political climate and ongoing struggles between opposition groups and the government.</p>
<h2>Society and Tragedy</h2>
<p>Two tragic deaths have been reported this week. In India, a mother and her infant were burnt to death by a mob following allegations of witchcraft, according to eyewitness accounts. This incident reflects deep social challenges around superstition and violence in some regions. In a separate incident, Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of online fashion retailer Asos, died after falling from an apartment block in Thailand. Griffiths had left the company five years after founding it but remained a major shareholder.</p>
<h2>Culture and Public Figures</h2>
<p>Eric Dane, an actor known for his roles in television series including "Grey’s Anatomy" and "Euphoria," died at age 53 after battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a common form of motor neurone disease. His passing has been marked by fans and colleagues in the entertainment industry.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>In Italy’s city of Catania, authorities uncovered a case where a dog had been trained to illegally discard rubbish. Officials condemned the act, emphasizing that creative tricks should not be used to excuse irresponsible behavior. Additionally, the group Hamas is in the process of electing a new interim leader after the deaths of its top leaders in confrontations with Israel, reflecting ongoing instability in the region.</p>
