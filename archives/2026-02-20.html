    <h2>International Politics and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The United States is closely watching negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. President Donald Trump issued a warning that the world has 10 days to see if Iran agrees to a deal, or else "bad things happen." Meanwhile, the US is increasing military forces in the Middle East as part of its strategic posture during these tense talks.</p>
<p>In a related development, the Supreme Court delivered a ruling that limits the US government's ability to impose tariffs when dealing with other countries. This decision reduces Trump's leverage in future trade negotiations and could shift the dynamics of US foreign economic policy.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>NASA is preparing to send humans back around the Moon with the Artemis II mission. After completing a successful "wet dress rehearsal" — a full launch simulation including fueling — the agency has targeted early March for the launch. This mission marks the next step in NASA's lunar exploration program and could pave the way for future crewed landings on the Moon.</p>
<h2>Legal and Human Rights Issues</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has been released from prison after nearly nine months. His release followed the passage of an amnesty law, signaling a possible easing of political tensions in the country.</p>
<p>In Cameroon, three soldiers received rare prison sentences for the killing of 21 civilians in the Anglophone region, an area troubled by conflict. This judgment stands out given the difficulties in holding military personnel accountable for abuses in the region.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Accidents</h2>
<p>In Austria, a climber was found guilty in the death of his girlfriend, who froze to death from hypothermia during a January 2025 expedition on the Grossglockner mountain. In another unfortunate incident, a French soldier died after being accidentally shot in the head during a military "game" designed to disarm colleagues and disable their weapons, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>In India, a mother and her infant were killed by a mob after rumors spread accusing her of practicing witchcraft. This tragic event highlights ongoing issues with superstition and violence in some communities.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of the online fashion retailer Asos, died after falling from an apartment block in Thailand. Griffiths left the company five years after founding it in 2000 but remained a significant shareholder.</p>
<p>In Italy, authorities uncovered a dog trained to illegally dump rubbish, a case that drew public criticism for turning cleverness into a form of incivility. The city of Catania condemned the act, emphasizing social responsibility.</p>
