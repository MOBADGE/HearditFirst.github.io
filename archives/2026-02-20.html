    <div class="date">February 20, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security</h2>
<p>Former U.S. leader Donald Trump has indicated he is considering a limited military strike against Iran. This statement follows his recent warning that Iran has about 10 days to agree to a deal aimed at curbing its nuclear program. The situation signals heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, with potential implications for regional stability and diplomatic negotiations ahead.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>NASA has announced plans to launch the Artemis II mission in early March, aiming to send humans back around the Moon. The agency reached this decision after successfully completing a "wet dress rehearsal," a crucial test involving fueling and countdown procedures. This milestone marks an important step in NASA's broader goal of sustaining human presence in deep space and potentially returning humans to the lunar surface.</p>
<h2>Legal and Human Rights Developments</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has been released after nearly nine months in prison. His freedom comes following the passage of an amnesty law, a move that could signal shifts in the country's political environment and offer new opportunities for dialogue. Meanwhile, in Cameroon, three soldiers received rare prison sentences for the killing of 21 civilians in the country's Anglophone region. These convictions are notable given the ongoing conflicts and high levels of violence in that area.</p>
<h2>Tragic Incidents</h2>
<p>Several tragic events have been reported recently. An Austrian climber was found guilty after his girlfriend died of hypothermia during a mountain trip on Grossglockner in January 2025. In India’s Tripura state, a mother and her infant were reportedly burnt to death by a mob following accusations of witchcraft. Additionally, in France, a soldier died after being shot in the head during a military "game" intended to disarm colleagues. These events highlight ongoing issues related to safety, superstition, and accidents within various communities.</p>
<h2>Unusual News</h2>
<p>Italian authorities in Catania have uncovered a dog trained to illegally dump rubbish, prompting the city to issue a warning that ingenuity should not excuse incivility. Separately, Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of the fashion retailer Asos, died after falling from an apartment block in Thailand. Griffiths had played a significant role in the company’s founding in 2000 and remained a large shareholder years after leaving.</p>
<h2>Middle East Political Developments</h2>
<p>The armed group Hamas is holding a vote to elect a new interim leader following the deaths of its top leaders in strikes by Israel. This leadership change could affect the group's future actions and influence the dynamics of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
