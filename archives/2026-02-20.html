    <h2>US Politics and International Relations</h2>
<p>The US Supreme Court has issued a ruling that weakens President Donald Trump's ability to use tariffs as a tool in his dealings with other countries. This decision represents a significant setback for Trump's plans if he pursues a second term, limiting how the US can impose trade restrictions. Meanwhile, Trump has also issued a warning to Iran, stating that the world has 10 days to see if a nuclear deal can be reached with the Islamic Republic; otherwise, "bad things happen." The US is increasing its military presence in the Middle East as negotiations continue.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>Nasa is preparing to send humans on a mission around the Moon in early March. This follows a successful "wet dress rehearsal," which is a practice run of the Artemis II mission's launch procedures. The upcoming mission aims to build on previous achievements in lunar exploration and is important for advancing human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit.</p>
<h2>Legal and Crime News</h2>
<p>In a rare legal outcome in Cameroon, three soldiers received prison sentences for the killing of 21 civilians in the country's troubled Anglophone region. This marks an uncommon instance of accountability within the military amid ongoing conflict. In Austria, an individual was found guilty after his girlfriend died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025. The case drew attention to the dangers of mountain expeditions and responsibility among climbing partners.</p>
<h2>Tragedies and Accidents</h2>
<p>A French soldier died after being shot in the head during a so-called "game" with other soldiers, which involves trying to disarm a colleague and disable their weapon. Prosecutors confirmed the incident was part of this risky practice. In Thailand, Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of the online fashion retailer Asos, died after falling from an apartment block. Griffiths had left the company as an active manager five years earlier but remained a major shareholder.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Human Rights</h2>
<p>In India, a mother and her infant were burnt to death after a mob attacked their home amid rumors that the woman was practicing witchcraft. Eyewitnesses reported rising tensions leading to this tragic act of violence fueled by superstition. In Italy, authorities discovered a dog that had been trained to illegally dump rubbish, prompting a warning from the city of Catania against justifying incivility with "ingenuity."</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Venezuela</h2>
<p>Juan Pablo Guanipa, an opposition politician in Venezuela, was released after nearly nine months of imprisonment. His release follows the passage of an amnesty law, indicating a potentially shifting political atmosphere in the country.</p>
