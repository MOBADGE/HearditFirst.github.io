    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 20, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>The United States is closely watching developments in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. Donald Trump has issued a warning that the world has 10 days to see if an agreement can be reached with Iran, cautioning that "bad things happen" if talks fail. Meanwhile, the US is increasing its military presence in the Middle East amid these high-stakes discussions.</p>
<p>In another significant development, the Supreme Court has issued a ruling that restricts the US government's power to impose tariffs on other nations. This decision is seen as a setback for Donald Trump's plans that involved using trade tariffs to influence international relations, potentially limiting his ability to negotiate in a possible second term.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>NASA is preparing to send humans back around the Moon with its Artemis II mission, targeting an early March launch date. This follows a successful "wet dress rehearsal," a key test involving fueling the rocket and simulating launch operations. The mission is an important milestone in NASA's broader efforts to return humans to lunar orbit and ultimately to the surface.</p>
<h2>Justice and Security</h2>
<p>Cameroon has seen a rare instance of accountability where three soldiers received prison sentences for the killing of 21 civilians in the country's Anglophone region, a conflict zone marked by unrest. This judicial action stands out as an uncommon consequence for military personnel in the area.</p>
<p>In France, a soldier has died after being shot in the head during what prosecutors described as a "game" involving attempts to disarm colleagues and disable their weapons. The incident highlights risks within military training or culture demanding further attention.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa was released after nearly nine months in prison following the passage of an amnesty law. His freedom could signal shifting political dynamics in the country.</p>
<p>Tragically, in India, a mother and her infant were burned to death by a mob after allegations surfaced that she practiced witchcraft. Eyewitness accounts say the mob attacked her home, underscoring ongoing challenges related to superstition and community violence.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>In Austria, a climber was found guilty in connection with the death of his girlfriend, who died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.</p>
<p>Also, Quentin Griffiths, who co-founded the online fashion retailer Asos in 2000, has died after a fall from an apartment block in Thailand. Griffiths left the company five years after founding it but remained a significant shareholder.</p>
<p>Finally, in Italy, authorities discovered that a dog had been trained to illegally dump rubbish, prompting the City of Catania to warn that creativity should not excuse irresponsible behavior.</p>
