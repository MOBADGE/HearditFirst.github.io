    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 20, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions in the Middle East have risen as the US increases military forces in the region amid ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran. Former US president Donald Trump has issued a warning that the world has about 10 days to see if Iran will agree to a deal; otherwise, "bad things" may happen. This development highlights the fragile state of diplomacy concerning Iran's nuclear programme and raises concerns about possible future conflict.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the armed group Hamas is in the process of electing a new interim leader following the deaths of its top leaders in Israel. This leadership change is significant as it may impact the group's future actions and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<h2>Environment and Crime</h2>
<p>In Zimbabwe, authorities have successfully used lion DNA to convict poachers for the first time. By matching genetic material to a lion database, investigators could identify a missing animal linked to illegal hunting. This marks an important step in wildlife conservation and law enforcement.</p>
<p>In South Africa, farmers face mounting fears as foot-and-mouth disease spreads through livestock. The government has started a vaccination programme to contain the outbreak; however, officials have been criticized for their slow response. The situation could have severe economic impacts if the disease continues to spread.</p>
<h2>Human Interest</h2>
<p>A mysterious donor in Japan has generously donated $3.6 million worth of gold bars to the city of Osaka to help fix its water system. The mayor expressed deep appreciation and surprise over the anonymous gift. This unusual act of philanthropy could bring significant improvements to local infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Health</h2>
<p>Eric Dane, an actor known for his roles in "Grey’s Anatomy" and "Euphoria," has died at the age of 53. He had been living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neurone disease. His passing has been mourned by fans and colleagues alike.</p>
<p>In music news, Zach Top made headlines by winning the first ever Grammy Award for best traditional country album. He is noted for bringing traditional country music to new and broader audiences, signaling a renewed interest in the genre.</p>
<h2>Government and Public Interest</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump has directed the government to prepare for the release of files on extraterrestrials and unidentified flying objects (UFOs). He cited the "tremendous interest" among the public on this topic. This move may lead to new information being made available about previously confidential government investigations into UFOs.</p>
<h2>Legal and Judicial</h2>
<p>An Austrian climber was found guilty following the death of his girlfriend, who froze to death due to hypothermia during a climbing expedition on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025. The verdict concludes a tragic case that had drawn attention to safety and responsibility in extreme mountain sports.</p>
