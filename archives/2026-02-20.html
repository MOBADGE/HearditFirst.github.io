    <h2>Global Trade and Tariffs</h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down some of the sweeping tariffs introduced under the Trump administration, creating uncertainty in global trade markets. In response, Trump announced a new 10% tariff on certain imports. This move reflects ongoing tensions in trade policy and could affect international business relations. How nations and companies adjust to these changes will be important to watch in the coming months.</p>
<h2>U.S. and Middle East Tensions</h2>
<p>Trump has signaled that he is considering a limited military strike on Iran. This announcement follows his recent statement giving Iran about ten days to reach an agreement on curbing its nuclear program. The situation remains tense, and any military action or diplomatic resolution could have significant implications for regional stability and international relations.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration Update</h2>
<p>Nasa is planning to send humans around the Moon with the Artemis II mission, targeting an early March launch. This decision follows a successful "wet dress rehearsal," a critical test of the spacecraft's readiness. The mission represents an important step in NASA's broader goals of lunar exploration and could pave the way for future space travel.</p>
<h2>Legal Accountability in Cameroon</h2>
<p>In Cameroon, three soldiers have been sentenced to prison for the killing of 21 civilians in the country's Anglophone region. Such prison terms are rare in this context and mark a notable development in efforts toward accountability in the troubled area. The verdict may have implications for human rights and military conduct in the region.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Tragedies</h2>
<p>Several tragic incidents have drawn attention around the world. An Austrian climber was found guilty after his girlfriend died of hypothermia during a mountain expedition in January 2025. In France, a soldier died of a gunshot wound during a military "game" intended to disarm colleagues. In India, a mother and her infant were burnt to death by a mob following allegations of witchcraft. These events highlight ongoing risks and social issues in various communities.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous News</h2>
<p>Asos co-founder Quentin Griffiths died after a fall in Thailand. Meanwhile, a dog in Italy was reportedly trained to illegally dump rubbish, prompting city officials to condemn the act as incivility. In Venezuela, opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa was released from prison following the passage of an amnesty law after nearly nine months in detention.</p>
