    <h2>U.S. Supreme Court Limits Tariff Powers</h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a ruling that reduces the government’s ability to impose tariffs on other countries. This decision affects policies put in place during Donald Trump’s administration and complicates future trade negotiations. With fewer tools to address unfair trade practices through tariffs, the ruling reshapes how the U.S. might engage economically on the global stage moving forward.</p>
<h2>NASA Prepares for Moon Mission Launch</h2>
<p>NASA is targeting early March to launch the Artemis II mission, which aims to send humans around the Moon. The space agency recently completed a "wet dress rehearsal," a key test involving fueling and countdown procedures for the rocket. This mission represents a critical step in returning people to lunar orbit and advancing human space exploration beyond Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Developments in Venezuela and Cameroon</h2>
<p>In Venezuela, opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has been released after nearly nine months in prison. His freedom followed the passage of an amnesty law, signaling a shift in the country's political climate and potentially impacting negotiations between the government and opposition forces.</p>
<p>In Cameroon’s Anglophone region, three soldiers received prison sentences for the killing of 21 civilians. This rare judicial action marks a significant step toward accountability in a region experiencing ongoing conflict and human rights abuses.</p>
<h2>Tragic Incidents in Europe and India</h2>
<p>A court in Austria found a climber guilty following the death of his girlfriend from hypothermia during a climb on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025. The ruling highlights the risks of mountain expeditions and the legal responsibilities involved.</p>
<p>In Italy, authorities uncovered a case where a dog was trained to illegally dump rubbish in Catania. The city condemned the act, stating that creativity should not be used to justify uncivil behavior.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an Indian state, a mother and infant were burnt to death after a mob accused the woman of witchcraft. Eyewitnesses reported that the mob attacked her home following rumors, illustrating ongoing social tensions and violence over superstition.</p>
<h2>Notable Deaths</h2>
<p>Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of the online fashion retailer Asos, died after falling from an apartment block in Thailand. He co-founded the company in 2000 and held substantial shares even after departing the firm in 2005.</p>
<p>Actor Eric Dane, known for roles in Grey's Anatomy and Euphoria, passed away at age 53. He had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neurone disease, which he had battled before his death.</p>
<h2>Tensions Rising Over Iran Nuclear Deal</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has issued an ultimatum, stating that the world has ten days to see if Iran will agree to a nuclear deal. The U.S. is deploying additional forces to the Middle East amid ongoing negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. This development raises concerns about stability in the region and the potential for escalated conflict depending on the coming days' outcomes.</p>
