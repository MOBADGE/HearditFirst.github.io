    <h2>International Politics and Security</h2>
<p>Former US president Donald Trump faces a setback to part of his foreign policy approach after a recent Supreme Court ruling. The decision limits the executive branch's ability to impose tariffs without Congress's approval, weakening tools previously used to negotiate with other countries. This ruling might affect how future administrations manage trade relations and respond to economic challenges globally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions remain high in the Middle East as the US intensifies its military presence in the region. Trump stated that Iran has a 10-day window to reach a nuclear agreement, warning of potential negative consequences if no deal is achieved. The US move signals the importance of ongoing negotiations with Iran and reflects broader concerns about security and diplomacy in the area.</p>
<h2>Space Exploration</h2>
<p>NASA has set its sights on early March for the Artemis II mission launch, aiming to send humans back around the Moon. This follows a successful "wet dress rehearsal," a key test involving fueling the rocket and practicing countdown procedures. The mission represents a significant step toward sustained human exploration beyond Earth, potentially paving the way for future lunar bases or crewed missions to Mars.</p>
<h2>Legal and Human Rights Issues</h2>
<p>In Cameroon, three soldiers were sentenced to prison for the killing of 21 civilians in the country's Anglophone region. This rare legal action highlights ongoing efforts to address human rights abuses amid long-standing conflict. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa was released after nearly nine months in prison, following the passage of an amnesty law. His release may signal shifts in Venezuela's political climate, though broader tensions persist.</p>
<h2>Tragic Incidents and Crime</h2>
<p>Several tragic events have occurred recently. In Austria, a climber was found guilty following the death of his girlfriend, who froze to death during a mountain expedition on Grossglockner in early 2025. In France, a soldier died after being accidentally shot in the head during a military game designed to disarm colleagues, underscoring dangers even in routine activities.</p>
<p>In India’s Jharkhand state, a mother and her infant died from burns after a mob attacked their home amid witchcraft allegations. This incident points to ongoing social challenges and the risks faced by vulnerable individuals due to superstition and violence.</p>
<h2>Unusual News and Community Issues</h2>
<p>Authorities in Catania, Italy, issued a rare warning after discovering a dog trained to illegally dump rubbish. The city condemned the behavior as a misuse of creativity, emphasizing civic responsibility and community standards.</p>
<p>Additionally, the fashion industry mourned the loss of Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of the online fashion retailer Asos. Griffiths, who helped start the company in 2000 and was a significant shareholder until his passing, died after falling from an apartment block in Thailand.</p>
