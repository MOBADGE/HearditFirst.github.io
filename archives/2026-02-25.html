    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 25, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Politics</h2>
<p>The US president delivered a lengthy State of the Union address that strongly appealed to his political supporters and included taunts directed at his opponents. According to the BBC's Anthony Zurcher, the speech gave little indication of any shift in the president’s current policies or approach. This suggests the administration may continue following its existing course in the near future.</p>
<h2>International Security</h2>
<p>Japan has announced plans to deploy missile systems on Yonaguni island by 2031. The island is strategically located near Taiwan, a key flashpoint in the region due to growing tensions between Taiwan and China. This move highlights increasing security concerns in East Asia and may impact regional military dynamics.</p>
<h2>Australian Threats and Crime</h2>
<p>In Australia, a Chinese dance group was reportedly threatened with bomb attacks at the home of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese if the group did not cancel its performances. Meanwhile, Australian police have arrested suspects in connection with the murder of 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian, who was mistakenly kidnapped and was not the intended target. These incidents underline ongoing security challenges both in cultural affairs and law enforcement.</p>
<h2>Conflict in Sudan</h2>
<p>Sudan’s Kordofan region has seen intensified drone attacks focused on gold and oil-rich areas, resulting in high casualties. The escalation marks the gold and oil zones as a critical new front in the country’s ongoing conflict, where peace efforts remain stalled.</p>
<h2>Europe-China Relations</h2>
<p>Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz has arrived in Beijing for his first official visit. Before departure, he emphasized that it would be a mistake for Germany to "decouple" from China, signaling a desire to maintain strong economic and diplomatic ties amid global geopolitical shifts.</p>
<h2>Senegal’s Proposed Law</h2>
<p>The prime minister of Senegal has proposed legislation that would significantly toughen penalties for "acts against nature," a phrase used in the bill to criminalize certain behaviors. The proposal includes increasing prison sentences to between five and ten years, reflecting ongoing debates about LGBT rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Institutional Developments</h2>
<p>In France, the director of the Louvre museum, Laurence des Carrs, has resigned just months following a high-profile heist. President Emmanuel Macron described the resignation as "an act of responsibility," suggesting accountability measures are being taken in response to the incident. In South Korea, Min Hee-jin, a former K-pop executive, has expressed deep distress over the potential breakup of the popular group NewJeans and has announced she will forgo an $18 million payout in an effort to keep the group together.</p>
<h2>US Federal Investigation Concerns</h2>
<p>A Democrat has alleged that the FBI director’s use of a private jet caused delays in several investigations. These allegations surfaced shortly after the director was seen celebrating in Italy with the US men’s hockey team following their Olympic victory. The claims raise questions about potential conflicts between personal activities and official duties within high-level government agencies.</p>
