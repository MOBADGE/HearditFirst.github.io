    <div class="date">February 25, 2026</div>
    <h2>US Politics</h2>
<p>The US president delivered a long State of the Union address that mainly appealed to his supporters and included taunts directed at his critics. According to the BBC's Anthony Zurcher, the speech did not indicate any significant change in direction for his administration. Instead, it focused on energizing his base as the political landscape remains highly polarized.</p>
<h2>Security and Crime in Mexico and Australia</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in Guadalajara, Mexico, following violent actions by cartel members seeking revenge for the killing of Nemesio "El Mencho" Oseguera, a prominent figure. Residents reported ongoing threats, and concerns about further violence persist.</p>
<p>In Australia, authorities charged two individuals with the murder of an 85-year-old grandfather, Chris Baghsarian. The incident began as a kidnapping stemming from mistaken identity. The case has highlighted ongoing issues related to violent crime and public safety.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Defense</h2>
<p>Japan announced plans to deploy missiles on Yonaguni island by 2031. Yonaguni is strategically located near Taiwan, a self-governing territory experiencing increased tensions with China. This deployment reflects growing regional security concerns amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Germany's chancellor made her first visit to Beijing, where she was urged by German business groups to address trade imbalances and raise concerns about competition and export controls with China. The visit underscores the complex economic relationship between Europe and China.</p>
<h2>Health Aid and Research Disputes</h2>
<p>Zimbabwe has rejected a health aid agreement with the United States, describing it as "lopsided." The main issue involves access to biological samples and a failure on the US side to share the benefits of research derived from those samples. This rejection points to ongoing challenges in international health collaboration and data sovereignty.</p>
<h2>Culture and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In South Korea, Min Hee-jin, former K-pop executive, publicly urged that the popular group NewJeans should not be broken up, even stating she would forgo an $18 million payout if the group remains intact. She expressed emotional distress over the group's potential dissolution.</p>
<p>In Senegal, the prime minister proposed stricter anti-LGBT legislation, which would increase prison terms for what the bill calls "acts against nature" to between five and ten years. This move could affect social and human rights discussions in the country.</p>
<p>Separately, in Australia, a Chinese dance group's upcoming tour has been disrupted by a bomb threat targeting the Prime Minister’s residence. The threat demanded the cancellation of the group's performances, leading to heightened security concerns ahead of the event.</p>
