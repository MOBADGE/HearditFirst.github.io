    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 25, 2026</div>
    <h2>U.S. State of the Union Address</h2>
<p>The U.S. president delivered a lengthy State of the Union speech that focused on appealing to his political base and challenging his opponents. According to a BBC analysis, the address showed little indication of any change in policy direction. The speech’s tone and content suggest the president’s intent to solidify his core supporters rather than pivot toward new approaches or broader consensus.</p>
<h2>Rising Tensions in East Asia</h2>
<p>Japan has announced plans to deploy missiles on its Yonaguni island by 2031. This island is situated near Taiwan, which is a self-governing territory facing increasing tensions with China. The missile deployment reflects Japan’s efforts to strengthen defense capabilities in a strategically sensitive area amid regional security concerns.</p>
<h2>Security Threats in Australia</h2>
<p>A Chinese dance group touring Australia faced a bomb threat demanding cancellation of its performances. The threat targeted the residence of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, warning of explosives if the shows proceeded. Australian authorities have responded by arresting several individuals linked to a related kidnapping and murder case, although the victim was reportedly not the intended target.</p>
<h2>Conflict Intensifies in Sudan’s Resource Region</h2>
<p>Drones have been used in intensified attacks across Sudan’s Kordofan region, particularly targeting the country’s key gold and oil zones. These attacks have resulted in mass casualties as the prolonged conflict continues without a clear resolution. The fighting in this resource-rich area remains one of the pivotal fronts in Sudan's ongoing instability.</p>
<h2>Germany’s Engagement with China</h2>
<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrived in Beijing for his first official visit to China. Before the trip, he cautioned against "decoupling" Germany’s economy from China, suggesting that maintaining engagement is preferable. This stance highlights Germany’s approach to balancing economic interests with geopolitical challenges in its relationship with China.</p>
<h2>Social Policy Changes in Senegal</h2>
<p>The Prime Minister of Senegal has proposed a new bill that would toughen penalties related to LGBT issues. The legislation seeks to increase prison terms from five to ten years for what it describes as "acts against nature." This move signals a potential tightening of social policies affecting LGBT communities in Senegal.</p>
