    <h2>Violence in Mexican City Escalates</h2>
<p>The city of Culiacán in northern Mexico has become increasingly violent as rival groups within the Sinaloa drug cartel clash for dominance. Residents face widespread fear as the conflict turns parts of the city into a war zone. This surge in cartel-related violence poses serious challenges for local authorities and impacts the daily lives of ordinary people. How Mexican officials respond to this escalation will be critical in restoring safety to the area.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Relations Await Key Talks</h2>
<p>The United States and Iran are preparing for a significant round of negotiations in Geneva scheduled for Thursday. These talks could influence upcoming decisions relating to Iran's future by the US president, whose plans remain unclear following the recent State of the Union address. Observers view these discussions as potentially decisive for the relationship between the two countries and regional stability.</p>
<h2>Bill Gates Addresses Epstein Connection</h2>
<p>Bill Gates acknowledged his association with Jeffrey Epstein during a meeting with foundation staff. He apologized and emphasized that he was not involved in any illicit activities, stating, "I did nothing illicit. I saw nothing illicit." This comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Gates’ past contacts with Epstein, and the foundation is seeking to address concerns raised among its members.</p>
<h2>Deadly Incident Near Cuba’s Coast</h2>
<p>Cuban authorities report that border guards shot and killed four people aboard a US-registered speedboat near an island off Cuba’s northern coast. Six other passengers sustained injuries in the incident. Details of why the border guards opened fire have not been clarified, but the event highlights the tensions and dangers in this region’s maritime border areas.</p>
<h2>Spain Releases Files on 1981 Coup Attempt</h2>
<p>Spain has declassified documents related to the attempted coup in 1981 in an effort to clarify historical details and dispel ongoing conspiracy theories. The timing coincides with the death of Antonio Tejero Molina, the figure who led the coup. This release could deepen public understanding of that turbulent period in Spain’s history and help to settle debates about the event’s true nature.</p>
<h2>International Religious Visit Planned</h2>
<p>Pope Leo is set to visit four African countries in April, marking a historic occasion as he will be the first pope to visit Algeria, a nation with a predominantly Muslim population. This trip may strengthen interfaith dialogue and reflect ongoing efforts to build bridges between religious communities in Africa. The visit is being watched closely as a symbol of outreach and international engagement.</p>
