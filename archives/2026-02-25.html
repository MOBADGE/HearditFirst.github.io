    <h2>Violence in Mexican City Escalates</h2>
<p>Culiacán, a city in northern Mexico’s Sinaloa state, has become a battleground as rival factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel fight for control. BBC correspondents report widespread fear among residents as violence surges, creating conditions likened to a war zone. The conflict has involved explosions and street clashes, disrupting daily life and raising concerns about public safety. The ongoing cartel feud highlights the ongoing challenges Mexico faces with organized crime and the impact on local communities.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Relations Await Key Talks</h2>
<p>The United States is poised for a potentially pivotal moment in relations with Iran ahead of upcoming discussions in Geneva scheduled for Thursday. After the recent State of the Union address, the US president has not detailed any specific plans regarding Iran, leaving global observers uncertain about the direction of policy. The Geneva talks could influence future engagements between the two countries, with implications for international diplomacy and regional security.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in Brazil</h2>
<p>Two brothers who are politicians in Brazil have been convicted for ordering the murder of Marielle Franco, a prominent councillor in Rio de Janeiro. Franco’s death at 38 years old sparked national protests and brought attention to violence against public figures. This conviction marks a significant moment in Brazil’s judicial response to political violence and may affect ongoing discussions about justice and accountability in the country.</p>
<h2>Spain Publishes Files on 1981 Coup Attempt</h2>
<p>Spain has declassified official files relating to the attempted coup d’état in 1981, aiming to address persistent conspiracy theories surrounding the event. The release coincides with the death of Antonio Tejero Molina, the coup’s principal figure. By making these documents public, Spanish authorities seek to promote transparency and historical understanding about a crucial moment in the country's recent history.</p>
<h2>International and Local News Briefs</h2>
<p>In New York City, the police department is seeking four individuals accused of injuring officers during a snowball fight incident. The police commissioner described the conduct as “disgraceful,” indicating tensions between authorities and community members over the event.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Switzerland, victims of a deadly bar fire will receive a solidarity payout. This financial contribution will support the 115 injured and families of the 41 people who lost their lives, demonstrating community and governmental support after the tragedy.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe has declined a US health aid agreement, citing concerns over unequal benefits related to biological samples and data sharing. Officials in Zimbabwe highlighted issues with the deal that they felt compromised fair access to the advantages of research collaborations.</p>
<p>Lastly, Pope Leo is set to visit four African countries this April, including Algeria, marking the first papal visit to the mostly Muslim nation. This trip reflects ongoing efforts to foster interfaith dialogue and strengthen ties with diverse communities in Africa.</p>
