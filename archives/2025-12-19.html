    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 19, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Security and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Russian leader Vladimir Putin stated in a televised event that claims of a planned attack on Europe are "nonsense." He promised that Russia would not engage in more wars if Western countries treat Russia with respect. This statement comes amid ongoing tensions in the region and may impact future diplomatic relations between Russia and Western nations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Union has agreed to provide a €90 billion loan to Ukraine. The funds are intended to support Ukraine amid conflict but will only be repayable if Russia compensates for war damages. The EU is avoiding the use of Russian assets to finance this loan, signaling a cautious approach to financial support linked to the conflict.</p>
<h2>Crime and Public Safety</h2>
<p>A violent attack occurred in Taipei's metro system when a suspect set off a smoke bomb and then carried out a knife attack. Three people were killed in the incident, which began at the city's main metro station before moving to another nearby station. Authorities are investigating the motivations and circumstances behind the attack.</p>
<p>In Germany, a 61-year-old man was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for drugging, raping, and filming his wife over several years. He posted the videos online, leading to his conviction. This case highlights ongoing concerns about domestic abuse and online criminal behavior.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues</h2>
<p>A French court has rejected a request to suspend the Shein website over concerns regarding the sale of childlike sex dolls. The fast-fashion company welcomed the court's decision, emphasizing that protecting French consumers remains its priority. The judgment will affect ongoing discussions about regulation of online sales and consumer safety.</p>
<h2>Public Protests and Unrest</h2>
<p>In Bangladesh, protests have resumed following the death of a protest leader involved in movements that led to the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Demonstrators set fire to newspaper offices, and staff described scenes of chaos and difficulty breathing due to smoke. The unrest underscores ongoing political tensions within the country.</p>
<h2>Health and Public Welfare</h2>
<p>Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit has been reported to likely need a lung transplant due to pulmonary fibrosis, a condition causing stiffened lungs and breathing difficulties. The palace's announcement sheds light on her serious health challenges and may prompt discussions on treatment and public awareness of this disease.</p>
<h2>Travel and Tourism Changes</h2>
<p>Starting February, tourists visiting Rome's Trevi Fountain will be required to pay a €2 fee if they do not live in the city. This new charge aims to manage the high number of visitors to the historic Baroque monument and may influence tourism patterns in the area.</p>
<h2>US Policy Update</h2>
<p>The United States has suspended its green card lottery program after the suspect in a recent university shooting and a separate murder of an MIT professor entered the country via this scheme. This move reflects concerns about security and immigration processes following violent incidents.</p>
