    <h2>International Support for Ukraine</h2>
<p>EU leaders have agreed on a €90 billion loan package to support Ukraine. The loan is structured so that repayments will only begin if and when Russia pays reparations related to the ongoing conflict. This financial assistance aims to help Ukraine recover and maintain stability despite the challenges of war. The decision to exclude the use of Russian assets for immediate repayment highlights the EU's cautious approach in the matter.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy Changes</h2>
<p>In response to a deadly shooting at Brown University and the murder of an MIT professor, the United States has suspended its green card lottery program. The suspect in these incidents had entered the country through this lottery scheme. This move reflects increased scrutiny of immigration mechanisms following violent crimes linked to entrants under certain programs.</p>
<h2>Gun Control Measures in Australia</h2>
<p>Australia has announced its largest gun buyback initiative since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, following a recent attack in Bondi. The buyback aims to reduce the number of firearms among civilians and strengthen public safety. This decision signals the government’s continued commitment to tightening gun laws after past tragedies and recent violent events.</p>
<h2>Civil Unrest in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Protests in Bangladesh have intensified after the death of a prominent protest leader who was part of the movement that helped remove former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from power. During recent demonstrations, newspaper offices were set on fire, and staff described the experience as frightening, with some recalling "gasping for air." The ongoing unrest points to deep political tensions within the country.</p>
<h2>TikTok Agreement in the US</h2>
<p>The owner of TikTok, ByteDance, has reached agreements to prevent a US ban on the popular video-sharing app. This deal concludes years of efforts by Washington to compel ByteDance to sell its US operations. However, it remains unclear how these developments will affect the user experience for Americans on the platform, leaving some uncertainty about the future of TikTok in the US market.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Legal Tensions in South Africa</h2>
<p>South Africa has responded defiantly after the United States threatened consequences following a raid on a refugee center. Part of the dispute involves allegations that the US employed Kenyan workers without proper work permits to process refugee applications. This incident highlights ongoing challenges in managing refugee services and diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
