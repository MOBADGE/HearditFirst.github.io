    <h2>Russia-West Relations</h2>
<p>Russian leader Vladimir Putin stated in a televised marathon that allegations of a planned attack on Europe by Russia are "nonsense." He emphasized that Russia would avoid starting new wars if Western countries treated Russia with respect. This comment comes amid ongoing tensions between Russia and the West, highlighting an ongoing diplomatic standoff. Putin’s remarks could signal an openness to easing tensions, but the situation remains complex.</p>
<h2>EU Support for Ukraine</h2>
<p>The European Union has agreed to provide a €90 billion loan to Ukraine. However, they specified that the loan would be repayable only once Russia pays reparations related to the war. The EU leaders chose not to use Russian assets for immediate funding, reflecting caution about Moscow’s role and future responsibilities. This financial assistance is part of broader Western support for Ukraine in its ongoing conflict, with implications for the dynamics of the war and the future post-war recovery.</p>
<h2>Israeli Prisoner Abuse Allegations</h2>
<p>Two Palestinian men have come forward to the BBC, reporting experiences of sexual abuse while held in Israeli prisons. These claims echo broader reports about the treatment of prisoners under Israeli authority, which Israel denies. The allegations raise concerns about human rights and conditions within the region’s detention facilities, potentially affecting diplomatic discussions and international scrutiny of Israel's policies.</p>
<h2>Violence in Taiwan</h2>
<p>A violent incident occurred in Taipei when a knife attacker killed three people after setting off a smoke bomb in the city's main metro station. The suspect then targeted another nearby station before being stopped. This attack shocked the local community and raised issues about public safety in major urban transit areas. Authorities are investigating the motive and security implications of the event.</p>
<h2>Local News: Rome and Norway</h2>
<p>Starting in February, tourists visiting Rome will have to pay a €2 fee to get close to the Trevi Fountain, one of the city’s famous Baroque landmarks. This measure aims to possibly manage visitor numbers and preserve the site.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Norway, the palace announced that Crown Princess Mette-Marit is likely to need a lung transplant due to pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease that makes breathing difficult. This health update has drawn public attention and support as she faces a serious medical condition.</p>
