    <h2>Russia-West Relations</h2>
<p>Russian leader Vladimir Putin said in a lengthy televised discussion that claims Moscow planned an attack on Europe are "nonsense." He vowed that Russia would avoid further wars if Western countries treat Russia with respect. This statement comes amid ongoing tensions and conflict involving Russia and its neighbors. Putin’s comments signal a conditional willingness for peace but emphasize Moscow’s demand for recognition and respect from Western nations.</p>
<h2>European Union Support for Ukraine</h2>
<p>European Union leaders have agreed to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan. Notably, this financial support will not come from seized Russian assets. The loan is structured to be repayable only after Russia compensates for the damages caused during the war. This initiative reflects the EU’s continued commitment to support Ukraine while maintaining a firm stance on accountability and reparations from Russia.</p>
<h2>United States Releases Epstein Files</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice is set to release thousands of previously confidential files related to Jeffrey Epstein by this Friday. This action follows a legislative deadline backed by strong bipartisan support in Congress. The release of these documents could shed new light on Epstein’s activities and the extent of his network, responding to longstanding public and legal interest in the case.</p>
<h2>Violence in Taiwan's Capital</h2>
<p>In Taipei, a knife attacker killed three people after detonating a smoke bomb at the city's main metro station and continuing his rampage at a nearby station. This incident has raised security concerns about public transportation safety in Taiwan's capital. Authorities are investigating the motives behind the attack and reviewing measures to prevent similar events in the future.</p>
<h2>Gun Policy Changes in Australia and the US</h2>
<p>Following a shooting incident at a university in Brown, the United States has suspended its green card lottery scheme, as the suspect in that shooting and a related murder entered the country through this program. Meanwhile, Australia announced its largest gun buyback scheme since 1996, triggered by a recent violent attack in Bondi. This move aims to reduce firearm availability and prevent future tragedies, highlighting global efforts to address gun violence through policy changes.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Health Updates</h2>
<p>UN experts report some improvement in food supplies in Gaza but warn that around 100,000 people remain in "catastrophic conditions." Israel disputes this assessment, stating the report does not reflect the reality and overlooks the aid entering the area. In Norway, Crown Princess Mette-Marit has pulmonary fibrosis and is likely to need a lung transplant. This serious health update underscores ongoing concerns about her condition and the treatment required.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories touch on international diplomacy, conflict response, security, and public health, each with potential implications for regional stability and global cooperation in the months ahead.</p>
