    <h2>Support for Ukraine's Recovery</h2>
<p>The European Union has agreed to provide a €90 billion loan package to Ukraine to help support its ongoing recovery efforts. Ukraine had requested that the EU use €200 billion of frozen Russian assets to fund the assistance, but this proposal did not gain unanimous support, with Belgium opposing the move. The agreed loan aims to provide much-needed financial support to Ukraine without accessing these frozen assets. This decision reflects continued EU commitment to Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict and the complexities of funding mechanisms within the bloc.</p>
<h2>Changes in U.S. Immigration Policy After Tragic Shooting</h2>
<p>The United States has suspended its green card lottery program following a recent university shooting that also involved the murder of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. The suspect entered the country through this lottery scheme, which raises questions about immigration screening and security measures. The suspension represents a cautious response by U.S. officials as they review policies related to visa issuance and public safety concerns.</p>
<h2>Australia's Largest Gun Buyback Since 1996</h2>
<p>In response to a recent attack at Bondi Beach, Australia has announced a new gun buyback scheme, the largest since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, which led to significant gun law reforms. The program aims to reduce the number of firearms in circulation as part of efforts to enhance public safety and prevent further violence. This move signals the government’s commitment to addressing gun-related threats following tragic incidents.</p>
<h2>TikTok Owner Reaches Deal to Avoid U.S. Ban</h2>
<p>ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has signed a series of agreements intended to resolve longstanding disputes with U.S. regulators. These deals effectively end years of attempts by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its American operations. The resolution may stabilize TikTok’s position in the U.S. market, ensuring continued access for users while addressing concerns over data security and foreign ownership.</p>
<h2>Remembering Ukraine’s Forgotten Soldiers</h2>
<p>There is growing awareness about the plight of Ukrainian soldiers who have died by suicide, a subject that remains stigmatized and underreported. Although official statistics are not available, estimates suggest that hundreds of soldiers have taken their own lives amid the prolonged conflict. This issue highlights the mental health challenges faced by military personnel and the need for enhanced support and recognition for those affected.</p>
