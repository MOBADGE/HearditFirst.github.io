    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 19, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Conflict</h2>
<p>Russia's leader spoke during a lengthy TV broadcast, denying claims that Russia planned an attack on Europe and calling such allegations "nonsense." He stated that Russia would refrain from engaging in further wars if the West treated Russia with respect. This statement comes amid ongoing tensions involving the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a related development, European Union leaders agreed to provide a €90 billion loan to Ukraine. However, the loan will only be repayable once Russia pays reparations for the war. Importantly, EU leaders decided against using Russian assets to fund the loan, highlighting ongoing concerns over how to support Ukraine while managing relations with Russia.</p>
<h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>A violent attack occurred in Taipei’s metro system, where a suspect used a smoke bomb followed by a knife attack, resulting in three deaths. The attacker began the spree at Taipei’s main metro station before moving to another nearby station. Authorities are responding to the incident as they investigate the motive and details.</p>
<p>In Germany, a 61-year-old man was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in prison for drugging, raping, and filming his wife over several years. The man also posted videos online, leading to his conviction. This case has underscored concerns about domestic abuse and online exploitation.</p>
<h2>Politics and Society</h2>
<p>In the United States, Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk, publicly endorsed JD Vance for president during a conservative conference known as Turning Point USA America Fest. The event was marked by debates and criticisms among conservative figures, reflecting ongoing divisions within the political right.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is experiencing fresh protests following the death of a leader associated with demonstrations that previously led to the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protesters set fire to newspaper offices, and staff recalled struggling to breathe amid the chaos, indicating continuing instability and social unrest in the country.</p>
<h2>Health and Public Policy</h2>
<p>Norway’s Crown Princess Mette-Marit is facing a serious health challenge, as officials announced she likely requires a lung transplant. She suffers from pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that stiffens the lungs and makes breathing difficult. The palace made the information public, drawing attention to her medical condition.</p>
<h2>Tourism and Culture</h2>
<p>Rome is introducing a new policy to charge tourists a €2 fee to access the area near the Trevi Fountain, starting in February. The fee will apply to visitors who do not live in Rome. This measure aims to manage crowds and preserve this famous Baroque monument while generating revenue from tourism.</p>
