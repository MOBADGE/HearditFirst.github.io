    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 19, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>Russia's leader spoke during a lengthy televised session, denying claims that Russia planned an attack on Europe, calling them "nonsense." He also said there would be no more wars if Western countries treated Russia with respect. Meanwhile, the European Union agreed to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan to support its recovery from the war with Russia. EU leaders specified that the loan would only be repayable once Russia pays reparations related to the conflict, rejecting the use of seized Russian assets for repayment.</p>
<h2>United States Legal and Policy Updates</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice will not meet a Friday deadline to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein, despite a congressional mandate supported almost unanimously. In another development linked to US security, the government has suspended the green card lottery program. This decision follows a shooting at a university in Brown and the murder of an MIT professor, both incidents involving a suspect who had entered the US through this lottery scheme.</p>
<h2>Tragic Events in Asia</h2>
<p>Violence struck Taiwan's capital when a knife attacker began a deadly spree at the main Taipei metro station, then moved to a nearby station. The assault, which included the use of smoke bombs, resulted in three deaths. In Bangladesh, protests have reignited following the death of a protest leader connected to the movement that ousted the former prime minister, Sheikh Hasina. During the protests, newspaper offices were set on fire, causing chaos and distress among staff.</p>
<h2>Legal Cases and Consumer Issues in Europe</h2>
<p>In Germany, a man was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for drugging, raping, and filming his wife over several years, with the videos posted online. In France, a court rejected a request to suspend the Shein website after complaints about childlike sex dolls being sold through the fast-fashion retailer. Shein expressed satisfaction with the decision and emphasized its commitment to protecting French consumers.</p>
<h2>Health and Humanitarian Concerns</h2>
<p>Norway’s crown princess is dealing with pulmonary fibrosis, a lung condition that makes breathing difficult, and officials say she likely needs a lung transplant. Meanwhile, UN-backed experts report improvements in food supplies in Gaza but warn that around 100,000 people remain in "catastrophic conditions." Israel disputed this assessment, stating that the report does not reflect the current situation and overlooks the aid being delivered to the Gaza Strip.</p>
