    <h2>International Aid to Ukraine</h2>
<p>The European Union has agreed to provide a €90 billion loan package to Ukraine to support the country amid ongoing challenges. Ukraine had initially requested the use of €200 billion from frozen Russian assets to fund the aid. However, due to opposition from Belgium and possibly other member states, the EU decided not to tap into these frozen funds. This financial support aims to help Ukraine's economy and reconstruction efforts, although debates about utilizing Russian assets continue to influence the broader geopolitical situation.</p>
<h2>Gun Control Measures in Australia and the United States</h2>
<p>In Australia, the government announced its largest gun buyback scheme since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. This measure follows a recent deadly attack in Bondi and represents a significant step toward tightening gun control laws, which were previously reformed after the 1996 tragedy. The scheme aims to reduce the number of firearms in circulation, contributing to public safety.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, authorities suspended the green card lottery program after it surfaced that the suspect involved in a university shooting and the murder of an MIT professor had entered the country through this scheme. The suspension reflects concerns about immigration pathways and public safety, pending further investigation.</p>
<h2>TikTok Deal and US Regulatory Challenges</h2>
<p>The owner of TikTok, ByteDance, has signed a deal with US authorities that is expected to end years of pressure from Washington to sell the company's US operations. This development may allow TikTok to continue its presence in the American market without facing a full ban. Despite this, it remains unclear how the user experience in the US will be affected, as negotiations and regulatory scrutiny persist.</p>
<h2>Protests and Unrest in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>In Bangladesh, protests erupted following the death of a protest leader who was part of movements that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Demonstrators set fire to newspaper offices, leading to chaotic scenes where staff recalled struggling to breathe amid the smoke. This unrest highlights ongoing political tensions and social divisions within the country.</p>
<h2>Public Health Concerns in India</h2>
<p>A troubling health issue emerged in India, where five children with thalassemia in Madhya Pradesh tested positive for HIV. This case comes shortly after a similar incident in Jharkhand state. Such developments have caused devastation and concern among families and health officials, raising questions about medical safety and blood transfusion protocols in these regions.</p>
