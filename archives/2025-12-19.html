    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 19, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Relations</h2>
<p>Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, stated during a four-hour televised session that allegations of Russia planning an attack on Europe are "nonsense." He added that Russia would not engage in further wars if Western countries treated Russia with respect. Meanwhile, European Union leaders have agreed on a €90 billion loan to support Ukraine. This loan is structured to be repayable only once Russia pays reparations related to the ongoing war, underlining continued European financial backing for Ukraine amid the conflict.</p>
<h2>Security and Crime</h2>
<p>In Taiwan, a knife attack at Taipei’s main metro station, followed by an incident at a nearby station, resulted in three deaths. The attacker initially triggered a smoke bomb before carrying out the stabbing spree. In Germany, a court sentenced a 61-year-old man to eight-and-a-half years in prison for drugging, raping, and filming his wife over several years, with the videos posted online.</p>
<h2>US Legal and Policy Updates</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice announced it will not meet a Congressional deadline to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein, despite a bill that secured near-unanimous support in Congress requiring full disclosure by Friday. Separately, the US government has suspended its green card lottery program following a shooting at Brown University and the murder of an MIT professor. The suspect in these incidents had entered the US through this lottery scheme, prompting the suspension.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the US</h2>
<p>At a recent conservative conference, Turning Point USA America Fest, Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk, publicly endorsed JD Vance for president. The event also saw heated exchanges among conservatives, reflecting ongoing debates within the political group.</p>
<h2>Public Unrest and Judicial Matters in Asia and Europe</h2>
<p>In Bangladesh, protests reignited after the death of a protest leader connected to the movements that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protesters reported traumatic experiences, including being trapped in smoke-filled offices set on fire. In France, a court rejected a request to suspend the Shein website over concerns about its sale of childlike sex dolls. Shein stated its priority remains protecting French consumers following the judgment.</p>
<h2>Health News</h2>
<p>Norway’s Crown Princess Mette-Marit has been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease that stiffens lung tissue and makes breathing difficult. The royal palace indicated she will likely require a lung transplant in the future to manage the condition.</p>
