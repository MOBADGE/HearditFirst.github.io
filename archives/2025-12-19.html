    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has said there will be no more wars if Western countries treat Russia with respect. During a televised marathon, he dismissed reports claiming Russia planned an attack on Europe as "nonsense." This statement comes amid ongoing tensions between Russia and Western nations. Meanwhile, European Union leaders have agreed to provide a €90 billion loan to Ukraine to support its recovery. The loan is structured to be repaid only once Russia pays reparations for the war, making clear the EU's stance on holding Russia financially accountable.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Human Rights</h2>
<p>Two Palestinian men have told the BBC they were sexually abused while detained in Israeli prisons, echoing recent reports about the treatment of prisoners. Israel denies these allegations. These claims highlight ongoing concerns about human rights and prisoner treatment in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<h2>Crime and Safety</h2>
<p>A violent attack occurred in Taipei when a suspect used a smoke bomb to create chaos in the city's main metro station before moving to a nearby station and stabbing people. The attack resulted in three deaths, raising security concerns in Taiwan’s public transport system.</p>
<h2>Social and Legal Issues</h2>
<p>In Germany, a 61-year-old man was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in prison after drugging, raping, and filming his wife over a long period. He shared the videos online, and the case has drawn attention to issues of domestic abuse and online exploitation.</p>
<h2>Consumer and Cultural News</h2>
<p>The French court has rejected a request to suspend the Shein website over concerns regarding childlike sex dolls. Shein, a fast-fashion company, welcomed the decision and emphasized its commitment to protecting French consumers. In Rome, tourists will face a new €2 fee starting February if they want to get close to the Trevi Fountain. The charge does not apply to local residents and aims to help manage the heavy flow of visitors at the Baroque landmark.</p>
<h2>Health and Royal News</h2>
<p>Norway’s Crown Princess Mette-Marit is facing serious health challenges due to pulmonary fibrosis, a disease that causes lung stiffness and breathing difficulties. The palace has indicated she will likely need a lung transplant to manage the condition.</p>

<p>This summary covers the main developments in international politics, human rights issues, public safety, legal matters, cultural updates, and health news from today.</p>
