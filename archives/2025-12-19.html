    <h2>European Union Approves Loan for Ukraine</h2>
<p>The European Union has agreed to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan package that aims to support the country's ongoing needs. Ukraine had initially requested the EU to use €200 billion in frozen Russian assets to fund its recovery, but this proposal faced opposition, particularly from Belgium. As a result, the loan deal excludes the use of these frozen assets. This funding signals continued EU financial support amid the conflict in Eastern Europe, although the rejection of using Russian assets could impact Ukraine's longer-term financial prospects.</p>
<h2>United States Suspends Green Card Lottery Program</h2>
<p>The US government has suspended the Diversity Visa (green card) lottery program following a recent university shooting and the murder of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor. The suspect in these attacks was admitted to the country through the lottery scheme. The suspension comes as officials reassess security measures linked to immigrant entry routes. The move reflects heightened scrutiny on how individuals enter the United States and the potential implications for public safety.</p>
<h2>Gun Control Efforts in Australia After Bondi Attack</h2>
<p>Australia has announced its largest gun buyback scheme since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, following a recent attack in Bondi. The new program aims to reduce the number of firearms in circulation by encouraging owners to voluntarily surrender weapons. This initiative builds on Australia’s history of strict gun laws introduced after the Port Arthur tragedy, which had led to significant declines in gun violence. The government's renewed efforts underline a commitment to preventing future attacks and enhancing public safety.</p>
<h2>TikTok Avoids US Ban with New Deal</h2>
<p>The owner of TikTok, ByteDance, has reached agreements with US authorities that could prevent a ban of the popular app in America. This deal ends years of attempts by Washington to compel ByteDance to sell its US operations amid concerns about data privacy and national security. However, it remains unclear how the agreement will affect the user experience for Americans. The resolution marks a significant step in the ongoing debate over foreign technology companies operating in the US market.</p>
<h2>Health Crisis in India: Children Test HIV Positive</h2>
<p>In India’s Madhya Pradesh state, five children with thalassemia have unexpectedly tested positive for HIV, sparking concern among families and health officials. This follows a similar incident reported recently in the neighboring state of Jharkhand. The cases have devastated parents and raised alarm about medical safety and infection control practices in healthcare facilities. Authorities are investigating the cause to prevent further infections and address public health vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Remembering the Victims of the Bondi Shooting</h2>
<p>Communities continue to honor the victims of the Bondi shooting, which occurred earlier this week. Hundreds gathered in a paddle-out event at Bondi Beach to pay tribute to those affected by the attack. Stories of bravery have emerged from the incident, including acts by lifeguards, a courageous mother, and individuals who lost their lives while trying to help others. These events highlight the human impact of the tragedy and the resilience of the community in its aftermath.</p>
