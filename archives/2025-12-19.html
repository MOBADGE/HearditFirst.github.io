    <h2>Europe and Ukraine</h2>
<p>The European Union has agreed to provide a €90 billion loan package to Ukraine to support its ongoing needs. Ukraine had requested the EU use €200 billion of frozen Russian assets to fund the aid, but Belgium opposed this, leading to an agreement that excludes using those assets. This financial support comes amid continuing tensions between Ukraine and Russia and highlights the EU’s commitment to assist Ukraine, though it stopped short of seizing Russian funds for this purpose.</p>
<h2>US Policy on Immigration and Technology</h2>
<p>In the United States, officials have suspended the green card lottery program after revelations that the suspect in a recent university shooting and the murder of an MIT professor had entered the country through this scheme. This pause signals a review of the program’s security and screening measures.</p>
<p>Separately, the owner of TikTok, ByteDance, has signed new agreements that will prevent the US government from banning the social media platform. After years of efforts to force ByteDance to sell its American operations over national security concerns, the agreements aim to allow TikTok to continue operating in the US. However, questions remain about how these deals will affect the user experience and data privacy for Americans.</p>
<h2>Gun Control and Public Safety in Australia</h2>
<p>In Australia, the government has announced its largest gun buyback scheme since the landmark reforms after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. This new program follows a recent shooting attack in Bondi and represents a major step to curb gun violence. The buyback intends to reduce the number of firearms in circulation and strengthen public safety measures.</p>
<h2>Social Unrest in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>Bangladesh is experiencing renewed protests after the death of a protest leader who played a role in ousting former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Demonstrators targeted newspaper offices, setting parts ablaze and forcing employees to recall moments of panic as they struggled to breathe amid the smoke. This unrest underlines ongoing political tensions and challenges to press freedom in the country.</p>
<h2>Health Concerns in India</h2>
<p>In India’s Madhya Pradesh state, five children with thalassemia—a blood disorder—have tested positive for HIV, causing distress among families and raising concerns about medical safety protocols. This incident follows a similar occurrence recently reported in Jharkhand state, pointing to possible systemic issues that authorities may need to address to prevent further cases and ensure patient safety.</p>
<h2>Remembering Victims and Acts of Heroism</h2>
<p>Communities continue to honor victims of recent tragic events. At Bondi Beach, hundreds of surfers and swimmers held a paddle-out tribute to those killed in the recent shooting. Coverage also highlighted stories of bravery, including lifeguards and a mother who acted heroically during the Bondi attack, saving lives under intense pressure. Meanwhile, attention is also focused on Ukrainian soldiers who have died by suicide—a largely hidden issue that affects hundreds and contributes to ongoing debates about mental health support for military personnel.</p>
