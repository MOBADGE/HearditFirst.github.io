    <h2>European Union Supports Ukraine with €90 Billion Loan</h2>
<p>European Union leaders have agreed to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan to aid recovery from the ongoing war. Crucially, the loan is set to be repayable only once Russia pays reparations for the conflict. However, the EU will not use frozen Russian assets to fund this loan, signaling careful fiscal planning amid geopolitical tensions. This financial package aims to support Ukraine's stability and rebuilding efforts, though the repayment condition ties Ukraine's financial burden to future developments in Russia.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Green Card Lottery Following University Shooting</h2>
<p>The United States has suspended its green card lottery program after the suspect involved in a recent university shooting and the murder of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor was found to have entered the country through this scheme. The suspension reflects growing concerns about the program's security and screening processes. Officials may review the lottery's procedures to balance immigrant opportunities with national safety.</p>
<h2>Australia Launches Largest Gun Buyback Since 1996</h2>
<p>In response to a recent attack in Bondi, Australia has announced a large-scale gun buyback program, marking the most significant effort since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. That earlier tragedy led to sweeping gun law reforms, and this new initiative aims to reduce firearm-related violence by incentivizing the voluntary surrender of guns. The program highlights Australia's continued commitment to gun control amid renewed concerns over public safety.</p>
<h2>Knife Attack in Taiwan Metro Claims Three Lives</h2>
<p>A violent incident unfolded in Taipei's main metro station when a suspect initiated a smoke bomb explosion followed by a knife attack, resulting in three deaths. After the first attack, the assailant moved to a nearby station to continue the assault. The attack has raised urgent questions about metro security and emergency response measures in public transportation hubs.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian Situation in Gaza Shows Improvement but Challenges Persist</h2>
<p>UN-backed experts report that while food supplies in Gaza are improving, approximately 100,000 people remain in catastrophic conditions. Israel has contested the report, stating it does not accurately reflect the aid volume entering the Gaza Strip. The situation underscores ongoing humanitarian challenges in the region, with aid access and distribution continuing to be critical concerns.</p>
<h2>Technology Deal Averts TikTok Ban in the US</h2>
<p>ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, has signed agreements intended to prevent a US ban on the app. This development ends years of efforts by Washington to compel ByteDance to divest its US operations due to national security worries. The deal suggests a potential pathway for continued TikTok operation in the US market while addressing regulatory concerns.</p>
