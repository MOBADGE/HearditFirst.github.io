    <h2>Ukraine Aid Package Approved by EU</h2>
<p>The European Union has agreed to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan to support the country. Ukraine had initially requested that the EU use about €200 billion of frozen Russian assets to fund assistance, but this proposal was blocked, with Belgium emerging as a key opponent. The loan marks a significant financial commitment by the EU, although it stops short of tapping into seized Russian funds, a point of contention for Ukraine. This aid aims to sustain Ukraine amid ongoing challenges, although how the funds will be managed without the Russian assets remains a topic to watch.</p>
<h2>US Suspends Green Card Lottery After University Shootings</h2>
<p>In the United States, authorities have suspended the green card lottery program following a tragic shooting at Brown University where an MIT professor was also murdered. The suspect entered the country through this lottery scheme, which has drawn scrutiny amid the violence. This move signals a potential reevaluation of immigration and visa issuance policies in the wake of the incident. Officials will likely review the program’s safeguards as they consider next steps to prevent similar cases.</p>
<h2>Australia Launches Major Gun Buyback Program</h2>
<p>Australia has announced its largest gun buyback scheme since the landmark reforms following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. This initiative is a response to a recent shooting at Bondi Beach, reflecting ongoing concerns about gun violence in the country. The buyback aims to reduce the number of firearms in circulation and strengthen public safety. It is expected to renew debates on gun control and public security, highlighting Australia's continuing commitment to minimizing gun-related incidents.</p>
<h2>TikTok Reaches Deal to Avoid US Ban</h2>
<p>The owner of TikTok, ByteDance, has signed an agreement with the US government that will prevent the social media platform from being banned in the country. This deal concludes a multi-year effort by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its US operations amid national security concerns. The agreement may serve as a model for resolving tensions around foreign-owned technology companies operating in the US, though close monitoring of compliance and future relations is anticipated.</p>
<h2>Remembering Ukraine’s Forgotten Soldiers</h2>
<p>An often overlooked issue in Ukraine is the mental health crisis affecting soldiers, with reported but unofficial accounts indicating hundreds may have died by suicide. The stigma surrounding these deaths means there is little public data or discussion, leaving affected families without recognition or support. Addressing this invisible toll could become a crucial component of Ukraine’s broader efforts to care for those involved in the conflict, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive mental health services for military personnel.</p>
<h2>Community Honors Victims of Bondi Beach Shooting</h2>
<p>In the wake of the Bondi Beach shooting, hundreds of surfers and swimmers gathered to pay tribute to the victims. Stories of heroism have also emerged, including lifeguards and a mother praised for their bravery during the attack, as well as a couple who lost their lives trying to intervene. One father credited a stranger’s quick action with saving his child’s life. These commemorations highlight the strong community response and the ongoing healing process after the traumatic event.</p>
