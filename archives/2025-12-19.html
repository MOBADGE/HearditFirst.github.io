    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">December 19, 2025</div>
    <h2>International Conflict and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Russia's leader spoke during a televised event, denying claims that Russia planned an attack on Europe, describing such reports as "nonsense." He asserted that Russia would not engage in further wars if Western countries treat Russia with respect. Meanwhile, European Union leaders agreed on a €90 billion loan package to Ukraine to support the country amid conflict. The loan is structured to be repayable only after Russia pays reparations related to the war. This support highlights the EU's continuing involvement in the Ukraine conflict and the broader geopolitical tensions with Russia.</p>
<h2>Human Rights Concerns</h2>
<p>Two Palestinian men have reported to the BBC that they experienced sexual abuse while held in Israeli prisons. These claims resonate with recent reports about the treatment of prisoners by Israeli authorities, which Israel denies. These revelations add to ongoing concerns and debates regarding human rights conditions in the region.</p>
<h2>Public Safety Incident in Taiwan</h2>
<p>A violent incident took place at Taipei's main metro station where a suspect used a smoke bomb before attacking people with a knife, resulting in three deaths. The attack continued to a nearby station, causing further alarm. The event has raised concerns about security and safety on public transportation in Taiwan.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues in Europe</h2>
<p>In Germany, a court sentenced a 61-year-old man to eight-and-a-half years in prison for drugging, raping, and filming his wife over several years, and distributing the videos online. This case underscores challenges around domestic violence and exploitation.</p>
<p>In France, a court dismissed a request to suspend the fast-fashion company Shein's website over concerns related to the sale of childlike sex dolls. Shein responded by emphasizing its commitment to protecting French consumers. This decision highlights ongoing debates about consumer protection and content regulation in e-commerce.</p>
<h2>Local News and Culture</h2>
<p>Visitors to Rome will soon face a €2 fee to get close to the Trevi Fountain, starting in February. This charge applies to tourists not residing in Rome and aims to manage the large number of visitors around this popular Baroque monument.</p>
<h2>Health Update from Norway</h2>
<p>Norway's crown princess, Mette-Marit, is facing serious health challenges due to pulmonary fibrosis, a lung condition that makes breathing difficult. The royal palace indicated that she will most likely need a lung transplant, bringing attention to her condition and the medical care involved.</p>
