    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 04, 2026</div>
    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In the ongoing conflicts involving Russia and Ukraine, Natalia, a war widow, has moved her husband’s grave to Kyiv amid fears that Russian forces might seize her hometown. This personal story highlights the human cost and the upheaval faced by civilians in contested regions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains tense. Israeli military strikes killed 20 people, including several children, according to hospitals. The strikes came after an Israeli soldier was wounded by gunfire. This continues a cycle of violence in the region, with significant civilian casualties.</p>
<h2>Legal and Social Issues</h2>
<p>In Norway, Marius Borg Høiby, the son of the crown princess, appeared in court giving evidence in a rape trial. The case involves allegations from a woman who said she believed she had been drugged. The trial is closely followed given the high profile of the person involved.</p>
<p>In Hungary, a German activist who identifies as non-binary was jailed for attacks at a Nazi rally. Supporters have raised concerns about whether the activist will receive a fair trial in Hungary, reflecting ongoing debates about justice and human rights in the country.</p>
<h2>Justice and Accountability in the Epstein Case</h2>
<p>Melinda French Gates has called on her ex-husband Bill Gates and others named in connection with Jeffrey Epstein to address any remaining questions about their involvement. This demand follows new legal claims that Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew asked an exotic dancer for “sex acts” and treated her like a prostitute at Epstein’s home. The case continues to unfold with new allegations prompting calls for accountability.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Security Treaties</h2>
<p>The future of global nuclear arms control is uncertain as the New Start treaty between the US and Russia, which limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads, is due to expire soon. Experts fear this may trigger a new arms race, increasing tensions and reducing strategic stability between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>In Italy, a fresco in a Rome church depicting a cherub with the face of Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, had the face scrubbed out. The artist confirmed the portrayal, attracting visitors intrigued by the political and cultural symbolism.</p>
<p>In Greece, officials quickly blamed smugglers for recent migrant deaths, though analysts advise caution with such early explanations based on past experience where initial accounts have later been questioned.</p>
<p>Lastly, in a tragic incident, a 14-year-old boy told police he stabbed his art teacher because he had “too much hatred.” The prosecutor’s report says the teenager took a knife from his kitchen with the intent to attack the 60-year-old teacher, highlighting concerns about youth violence and underlying social issues.</p>
