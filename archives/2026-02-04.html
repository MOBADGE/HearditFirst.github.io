    <h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>Tensions and violence continue in various parts of the world. In Gaza, Israeli strikes have killed at least 20 people, including several children, according to hospitals. The strikes followed a gun attack targeting Israeli troops. Meanwhile, in Nigeria's western state of Kwara, gunmen attacked two villages, setting shops and homes on fire. This violence has led to confirmation of a US military deployment to the region. Additionally, in eastern Europe, Russia's advances in conflict zones have caused Natalia, a war widow, to move her late husband's grave to Kyiv out of fear it could be seized.</p>
<h2>Crime and Justice</h2>
<p>A man named Routh has been sentenced to life in prison for an attempted assassination of Donald Trump in 2024. Prosecutors noted that Routh showed no remorse for his actions during the trial. In Norway, Marius Borg Høiby, son of the crown princess, gave emotional testimony during a rape trial where he is accused. The court heard from the first accuser, who said she believed she had been drugged.</p>
<h2>Legal Developments Linked to Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
<p>New allegations continue to emerge involving Jeffrey Epstein’s network. Lawyers representing an unnamed exotic dancer claim she was coerced into performing sex acts at Epstein's residence and treated like a prostitute. Meanwhile, Melinda French Gates urged that her ex-husband Bill and others named in the Epstein files should publicly address any remaining questions about their associations with Epstein.</p>
<h2>International Relations and Arms Control</h2>
<p>There is growing concern about nuclear arms control between the US and Russia as the New Start treaty approaches expiration. This treaty has played a key role in limiting the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for both countries. Its potential end raises fears of a renewed arms race and increased global instability.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>The global popularity of Korean culture is affecting everyday products. For example, dried seaweed snacks—black, crispy, and often flat and square—have surged in demand, leading to significant price increases. This trend highlights how cultural phenomena can influence food markets worldwide.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Hungary, a 25-year-old German activist has been jailed following attacks at a Nazi rally. Supporters have expressed concerns about whether the activist, who identifies as non-binary, will receive a fair trial in the country.</p>
