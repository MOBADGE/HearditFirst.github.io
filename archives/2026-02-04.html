    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">February 04, 2026</div>
    <h2>Conflict and Security Updates</h2>
<p>The UK leader described Russia’s renewed attacks on Ukrainian power plants and critical infrastructure as "particularly depraved," highlighting the ongoing hardships faced by Ukraine amid the conflict. These attacks target essential services, potentially worsening the humanitarian situation.</p>
<p>In Gaza, Israeli military strikes killed 17 people, including six children, according to hospital reports. The strikes came in response to a gun attack that wounded an Israeli soldier, continuing the cycle of violence in the region.</p>
<p>In Libya, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the country’s former leader and once considered a powerful figure, was reportedly shot dead. His death marks a significant development in Libya’s ongoing instability.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>South Africa’s second largest political party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), announced that its leader will not seek re-election. This unexpected decision could affect the stability of the coalition government, of which the DA is a key partner. How this change will influence the political landscape remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Legal Cases</h2>
<p>Two journalists in China, Liu Hu and Wu Yingjiao, have reportedly been detained after exposing corruption involving a senior official in Sichuan province. Their detention raises concerns about press freedom and government transparency.</p>
<p>In Norway, the trial of Marius Borg Høiby, son of the royal family, continued as a woman testified she suspects she was drugged. The trial involves serious allegations including rape, and the court proceedings are closely watched.</p>
<h2>Environment and Public Safety</h2>
<p>A popular beauty spot in South Africa is facing a looming water shortage, with official estimates indicating that about 55% of the town's drinkable water is lost to leaking pipes. This infrastructure problem threatens the community’s access to clean water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a tragic maritime incident near the Greek island of Chios resulted in 15 migrant deaths following a collision between a migrant boat and a Greek coast guard vessel. The collision happened during a pursuit, highlighting ongoing challenges in managing migration and safety at sea.</p>
<h2>Personal Stories</h2>
<p>On a different note, holidaymaker Peter Smith shared his experience being attacked by a shark while swimming in the Caribbean. His account provides a personal perspective on the unexpected dangers that can occur during leisure activities.</p>
<p>Separately, Melinda French Gates publicly commented on the release of the Epstein files, stating that her ex-husband and others named need to answer remaining questions. Her remarks come amid ongoing public interest in those connected to the case.</p>
