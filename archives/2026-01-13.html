    <h2>US-Iran Tensions Rise</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on possible military and covert options regarding Iran amid escalating tensions. In addition, the United States has imposed a 25% tariff on countries that conduct business with Tehran. In response, Iran’s foreign minister declared that the country is "ready for war". This development indicates a growing strain between the two nations, which could have wide-reaching implications for regional stability and international relations moving forward.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in France</h2>
<p>A key moment is unfolding for France’s far-right politics as the appeal trial involving the leader of the party begins. Jordan Bardella, head of the party, expressed concern that banning her from running for president would be "deeply worrying" for democracy in the country. The outcome of this trial could significantly impact the political landscape in France ahead of future elections.</p>
<h2>US Greenhouse Gas Emissions Increase</h2>
<p>For the first time in three years, the United States has seen a rise in greenhouse gas emissions. This increase has been attributed mainly to colder weather and the energy demands of data centres. The uptick in emissions highlights ongoing challenges in the country’s efforts to combat climate change and underscores the need for effective environmental policies and innovations in energy consumption.</p>
<h2>Central Banks Back US Fed Chair</h2>
<p>Eleven central banks around the world have expressed their support for Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, following the launch of a criminal investigation into the US Fed. This show of solidarity underscores Powell’s standing in the global financial community and suggests that international monetary authorities remain united amid legal scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Crisis in Mali and Niger’s Response</h2>
<p>Niger has revoked the licences of tanker drivers who refused to enter Mali due to attacks by jihadist groups targeting fuel tankers. These attacks have worsened Mali’s fuel shortage as the country faces a blockade. Niger’s decision reflects the difficulties in ensuring supply routes remain open in conflict-affected regions and raises concerns about the humanitarian and economic impacts in Mali.</p>
<h2>Tragic Landslide in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A landslide at the Binaliw landfill in the Philippines has claimed 11 lives. The disaster occurred while more than 100 workers were present at the site. This tragedy highlights ongoing safety challenges in waste management operations and underscores the need for improved disaster preparedness and risk assessments to prevent future incidents.</p>
