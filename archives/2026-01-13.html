    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>In Iran, the political situation remains tense but not yet on the brink of collapse, according to a BBC international editor. Authoritarian regimes "die gradually then suddenly," but Iran is still in the gradual stage, and its opponents are hoping that increased pressure will speed up this process. Meanwhile, in Greenland, its prime minister made a firm declaration choosing Denmark over the United States amid renewed US plans to annex the territory by President Donald Trump. This marks the strongest political stance from a Greenlandic leader on the matter to date.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Investigations</h2>
<p>In the United States, former president Bill Clinton has refused to comply with a subpoena related to a committee investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, provoking Republican lawmakers to threaten him with contempt of Congress. The investigation continues to attract high-profile attention. Simultaneously, prosecutors in South Korea are seeking the death penalty for ex-president Yoon, who is accused of leading an insurrection in 2024 when he attempted to impose martial law, highlighting ongoing political turmoil in the country.</p>
<h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Niger has revoked the licenses of tanker drivers who refuse to transport fuel to Mali amid a jihadist blockade, which has intensified Mali’s fuel shortages. The security situation in the region continues to deteriorate due to militant attacks against supply lines. On another front, foreign men recruited to fight on Russia’s front lines report being misled by a former teacher who recruited them via Telegram. The recruits claim they were deceived with promises that combat could be avoided, raising ethical and human rights concerns about recruitment methods.</p>
<h2>Economy and Finance</h2>
<p>Eleven central banks worldwide have publicly expressed solidarity with US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell after a criminal investigation was launched into the Fed. This endorsement suggests continued international support for Powell’s leadership amid what many see as politically motivated scrutiny. In the US, immigration policy enforcement is tightening, particularly targeting the Somali community in Minneapolis, as protections from deportation are being withdrawn under the current administration's immigration crackdown.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>K-pop band BTS is set for a major comeback tour, their first since fulfilling compulsory military service in South Korea. The tour is expected to generate approximately $1 billion, underscoring the band’s global popularity and the significant economic impact of their music. In a related cultural note, Scott Adams, the controversial creator of the Dilbert comic strip, died at the age of 68. His death was announced by his ex-wife during a live podcast, marking the end of an influential career in satirical comics.</p>
