    <h2>Greenland Firmly Chooses Denmark Over US</h2>
<p>Greenland's prime minister has made a clear statement reaffirming the territory's ties with Denmark. This comes amid renewed interest from the US, where President Donald Trump had expressed plans to annex Greenland. The prime minister’s remarks mark the strongest response yet from Greenland’s leadership, emphasizing their preference to remain under Danish sovereignty. This stance could affect any future discussions about Greenland's political status and international relationships.</p>
<h2>Central Banks Support US Fed Chair Amid Investigation</h2>
<p>Eleven major central banks around the world have publicly expressed solidarity with Jerome Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve. This show of support follows the launch of a criminal investigation into Powell by US authorities. The backing from key global financial institutions underscores confidence in Powell’s leadership during a period of scrutiny, which could impact monetary policy and financial stability in the US and beyond.</p>
<h2>Legal Appeal Could Restore Le Pen’s Political Eligibility</h2>
<p>Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right party, has begun an appeal against a court ruling that currently bans her from running for public office for five years. The legal challenge holds significant implications for the upcoming French presidential elections. If successful, the appeal would allow Le Pen to participate in future elections and maintain her influence within French politics.</p>
<h2>Death Penalty Sought for Ex-South Korean Leader Yoon</h2>
<p>Prosecutors in South Korea have requested the death penalty for Yoon, a former president accused of instigating an insurrection linked to his attempt to impose martial law in 2024. This serious charge stems from a tense period in South Korean history and highlights ongoing legal and political repercussions from those events. The outcome of the trial will be closely watched both domestically and internationally.</p>
<h2>Struggles of Foreign Recruits on Russia’s Front Lines</h2>
<p>A BBC report has uncovered deceptive recruitment practices involving foreign men persuaded to fight in Russia’s conflict. An ex-teacher using Telegram misled recruits, suggesting they could avoid combat, but many found themselves on the front lines instead. This revelation sheds light on the complexities and human costs behind the conflict and may influence future recruitment efforts.</p>
<h2>US Ends Deportation Protections for Many Somalis Amid Crackdown</h2>
<p>The US government has announced plans to terminate deportation protections for many Somali immigrants living legally in the country, particularly around Minneapolis, which has a large Somali community. This move is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration and raises concerns about the impact on these communities and the broader immigration policy landscape.</p>
