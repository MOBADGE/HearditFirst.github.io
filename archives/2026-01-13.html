    <h2>International Tensions and Security</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on military and covert options concerning Iran amid heightened tensions. In response to Iran's activities, he has imposed a 25% tariff on countries that engage in business with Tehran. Iran's foreign minister has declared the country is "ready for war," signaling escalating rhetoric that could affect regional stability and international relations.</p>
<p>In another conflict zone, Niger has revoked the licenses of tanker drivers who refused to enter Mali due to attacks by jihadists. These attacks have exacerbated Mali’s fuel shortage, underscoring ongoing security challenges in the region.</p>
<h2>Political Developments</h2>
<p>In France, far-right leader Marine Le Pen has started an appeal against a ruling that banned her from running for public office for five years. The outcome of this appeal could influence the French presidential elections and the political landscape there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Corsica, a well-known separatist figure, Alain Orsoni, aged 71, was shot dead at his mother’s funeral. Orsoni had been living in exile in Nicaragua. The authorities are currently hunting for the gunman, raising concerns about violence related to separatist movements.</p>
<h2>US Domestic Affairs</h2>
<p>Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain, has filed a lawsuit against Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Kelly contests an attempt to review his retirement grade, which came after he criticized the Trump administration. This legal action highlights tensions within US military and political circles.</p>
<p>On the economic front, eleven central banks worldwide have expressed solidarity with Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve. This show of support comes after a criminal investigation into the Fed was launched in the US, signaling potential challenges for the country's monetary policy leadership.</p>
<h2>Environment and Human Interest</h2>
<p>In the US, greenhouse gas emissions have risen for the first time in three years, driven by cold weather and increased activity at data centres. This development is significant amid ongoing concerns about climate change and efforts to reduce carbon footprints.</p>
<p>A story from Mozambique marks the passing of Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the "miracle baby" who was born in a tree above floodwaters as her mother sought shelter during severe flooding. She died at the age of 25, reminding us of the ongoing human impact of natural disasters.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Conflict</h2>
<p>Reports have emerged from Russia of foreign men being lured to fight on the front line after being misled by a former teacher operating on Telegram. Recruits told the BBC they were tricked into combat roles, raising issues related to the recruitment and welfare of foreign fighters.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, a rubbish landslide at the Binaliw landfill has killed 11 people. Over 100 workers were present during the incident, highlighting ongoing concerns about workplace safety and disaster preparedness in the region.</p>
