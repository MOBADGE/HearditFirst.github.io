    <h2>US-Iran Tensions Escalate</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on possible military and covert actions against Iran, amid rising tensions between the two countries. In a new move, the US has imposed a 25% tariff on nations that engage in business with Tehran. In response, Iran's foreign minister has declared that the country is "ready for war." These developments signal a significant escalation in the already strained relations, with potential consequences for regional stability and international diplomacy.</p>
<h2>International Support for US Federal Reserve Chair</h2>
<p>Eleven central banks around the world have publicly expressed their support for Jerome Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve. This show of solidarity comes after a criminal investigation was launched into the Federal Reserve in the United States. The backing from global monetary authorities suggests confidence in Powell's leadership during challenging economic times, reinforcing the global financial system's stability.</p>
<h2>Legal Challenge in French Presidential Race</h2>
<p>Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right party, has started an appeal against a ruling that bans her from running for any public office for five years. This legal battle will determine whether she can participate in upcoming presidential elections. The outcome could have significant implications for French politics, potentially reshaping the country's political landscape.</p>
<h2>Death Penalty Sought for Former South Korean President</h2>
<p>Prosecutors have requested the death penalty for Yoon, a former South Korean president accused of leading an attempted insurrection. The charges relate to actions taken in 2024 when Yoon allegedly tried to impose martial law. This marks a serious turn in legal proceedings and highlights ongoing political tensions within South Korea.</p>
<h2>Rising Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the US</h2>
<p>For the first time in three years, greenhouse gas emissions in the United States have increased, driven mainly by cold weather and higher energy use from data centers. This rise poses challenges to national and global efforts to combat climate change, underscoring the need for effective environmental policies to manage energy consumption and reduce emissions.</p>
<h2>Security and Unrest in West Africa and the Philippines</h2>
<p>In Niger, authorities have revoked licenses of tanker drivers who refuse to deliver fuel to Mali, where a jihadist blockade has caused a severe fuel shortage. This move aims to counter disruptions caused by attacks on fuel convoys. Meanwhile, the death toll from a rubbish landfill landslide in the Philippines has reached eleven, with over a hundred workers present during the tragedy. Both incidents highlight ongoing security and safety challenges in these regions.</p>
<h2>Additional Notable Stories</h2>
<p>A former teacher using Telegram to recruit foreign men for combat in Russia has been accused by recruits of deception, claiming they were misled about avoiding frontline fighting. In Corsica, a well-known separatist figure, Alain Orsoni, was shot dead at his mother’s funeral. His death has prompted an active search for the gunman. In the US, Senator Mark Kelly is suing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over an attempted review of his retirement grade, a controversial move following Kelly's criticism of the Trump administration.</p>
