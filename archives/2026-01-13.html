    <h2>Iran Protests and Global Reactions</h2>
<p>A US-based human rights group has reported that at least 1,850 protesters have been killed during a crackdown by Iranian authorities amid ongoing demonstrations. The exact number of deaths is said to be over 2,000, reflecting the severe government response to the unrest. The US president has publicly encouraged Iranians to continue protesting, stating that "help is on its way." A BBC international editor noted that while authoritarian regimes often collapse suddenly after a long decline, Iran's current situation suggests it has not yet reached that tipping point. Pressure from both internal and external groups may influence how the situation develops going forward.</p>
<h2>US and Greenland Relations</h2>
<p>The leader of Greenland has made a clear statement expressing a preference to remain aligned with Denmark rather than the United States. This comes in the context of renewed US plans to annex Greenland, announced by the US president. The statement marks the strongest pushback from Greenland's leadership against the US proposals, highlighting tensions around sovereignty and control of the Arctic territory.</p>
<h2>US Federal Reserve Support</h2>
<p>Eleven central banks around the world have expressed solidarity with Jerome Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve. This show of support comes after US authorities launched a criminal investigation into Powell himself, an unusual and notable situation. The backing from these central banks underscores the importance of maintaining stability and confidence in global financial leadership amid the investigation.</p>
<h2>Legal and Political Developments Around the World</h2>
<p>In South Korea, prosecutors have requested the death penalty for former president Yoon, who is accused of leading an insurrection by attempting to impose martial law in 2024. This marks a significant escalation in legal proceedings surrounding his actions during that event.</p>
<p>In the United States, Republicans have threatened to hold Bill Clinton in contempt after he did not appear to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein. Clinton argued that the subpoena was not enforceable, leading to a standoff that could have further political repercussions.</p>
<h2>Other News Highlights</h2>
<p>- In Russia, some foreign recruits say they were misled by a woman who recruited them via Telegram, promising they could avoid combat before sending them to the frontline. This story highlights the complexities and personal risks involved in the conflict.</p>
<p>- The controversial cartoonist Scott Adams, known for creating *Dilbert*, has died at the age of 68. His ex-wife announced his passing during a live podcast stream.</p>
<p>- In the US, the administration is moving to end deportation protections for many Somalis living legally in the country, particularly as immigration enforcement increases in Minneapolis, which has a large Somali community.</p>
<p>- The K-pop band BTS announced a major comeback tour, their first since finishing compulsory military service in South Korea. The tour is expected to bring in around $1 billion, underscoring the group's global popularity.</p>
<p>These stories reflect ongoing political tensions, legal battles, and cultural moments with global significance.</p>
