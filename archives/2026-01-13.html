    <h2>Iran Protests and International Reactions</h2>
<p>More than 2,000 people have reportedly died during protests in Iran, following a crackdown by authorities. A US-based rights organization has confirmed the deaths of 1,850 protesters so far. Meanwhile, the US president has encouraged Iranians to continue demonstrating, stating that "help is on its way." The situation remains tense, with ongoing calls for further pressure on Iran's regime. BBC's international editor noted that while authoritarian regimes often collapse "gradually then suddenly," Iran has not yet reached that critical point, though opponents hope increased pressure might accelerate change.</p>
<h2>Developments in the US and International Finance</h2>
<p>In the United States, eleven central banks around the world have publicly expressed solidarity with Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, following the launch of a criminal investigation into the Fed. This display of support underscores Powell’s standing among global financial leaders amid unusual legal scrutiny. Separately, the Trump administration is set to end deportation protections for many Somalis living legally in the US, particularly targeting the large Somali community in Minneapolis, as part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration.</p>
<h2>Political News from Around Asia and the US</h2>
<p>In South Korea, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for ex-president Yoon, accusing him of leading an insurrection related to his attempt to impose martial law in 2024. This marks a serious escalation in legal proceedings against a former head of state. In the US, former president Bill Clinton has refused to testify before a congressional committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein, citing that the subpoena is not enforceable. In response, Republicans have vowed to hold him in contempt of Congress.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Updates</h2>
<p>The popular K-pop group BTS has announced a major comeback tour, their first since completing South Korea’s compulsory military service. The band is projected to earn up to $1 billion from this tour, highlighting their significant global appeal. On a different note, Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert cartoon, has died aged 68. His ex-wife announced his passing during a live stream of his podcast.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>In Greenland, the territory's prime minister has made a strong statement favouring Denmark over the US, following renewed US plans to annex Greenland. This represents an important diplomatic stance amid ongoing discussions about Greenland’s political status. Additionally, recruits who were misled by a former teacher operating on Telegram have spoken out about being tricked into fighting on Russia’s front lines, contrary to assurances that they could avoid combat.</p>
<p>These events collectively illustrate ongoing political tensions, significant cultural moments, and shifts in global alliances as 2026 unfolds.</p>
