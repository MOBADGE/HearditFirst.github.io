    <h2>US-Iran Tensions Escalate</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on various military and covert options regarding Iran amid rising tensions. At the same time, the US has imposed a 25% tariff on countries that maintain business relations with Tehran. In response, Iran's foreign minister declared that the country is "ready for war." These developments reflect growing strain between the two nations, suggesting that the situation could escalate further depending on diplomatic and military actions.</p>
<h2>Greenland Reaffirms Ties with Denmark</h2>
<p>Greenland’s prime minister made a strong statement rejecting renewed US plans to annex the territory, affirming a preference to remain closely aligned with Denmark. This marks the most decisive public stance by a Greenlandic leader since the US president's recent renewed interest in annexation. The statement underscores Greenland’s desire to maintain its current political connections and could influence future US-Denmark-Greenland relations.</p>
<h2>Global Support for US Federal Reserve Chair</h2>
<p>Eleven central banks around the world have expressed solidarity with Jerome Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve. The support comes amid the launch of a criminal investigation into the Federal Reserve by US authorities. This show of backing highlights confidence in Powell’s leadership of the US central bank and suggests unity among major financial institutions during a time of scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Legal Challenge in French Politics</h2>
<p>France’s far-right leader Marine Le Pen has begun an appeal against a ruling that bans her from running for public office for five years. The appeal process will determine whether she can participate in future elections, including the possibility of running for president. This legal challenge is significant for French politics, as it involves a prominent figure with considerable support.</p>
<h2>Rising Conflict and Instability in Africa</h2>
<p>Niger has revoked the licenses of tanker drivers who refused to deliver fuel to Mali due to threats from jihadist groups. The refusal and blockade have intensified Mali’s fuel shortage amid ongoing security challenges. The move represents Niger's effort to enforce transport to a neighboring country facing increasing destabilization. Meanwhile, in South Korea, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for ex-president Yoon, who is accused of leading an insurrection in 2024 by attempting to impose martial law, highlighting volatile political situations in different regions.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>- In the Philippines, the death toll from a rubbish landslide at a landfill has risen to 11, with over 100 workers present during the incident.  
- The US plans to end deportation protections for many Somalis amid a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, particularly in Minneapolis, home to a large Somali community.  
- The K-pop band BTS is preparing for a major comeback tour, the first since members completed compulsory military service in South Korea, with estimated earnings of up to $1 billion.  
- Some foreign recruits in Russia have reported being misled by a Telegram operator about avoiding combat, revealing complexities in recruitment for frontline fighting.</p>
