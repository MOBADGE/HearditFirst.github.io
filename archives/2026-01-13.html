    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Tensions Over Iran</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on military and covert options regarding Iran amid rising tensions. In a significant move, the US also imposed a 25% tariff on countries that continue business dealings with Tehran. Iran’s foreign minister responded by stating that the country is "ready for war," signaling the potential for escalating conflict. These developments underscore a serious international standoff that may affect global diplomacy and security.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in France and Australia</h2>
<p>In France, Marine Le Pen faces an appeal trial that could impact her eligibility to run for president. Jordan Bardella, leader of her far-right party, warned that barring her candidacy would pose a threat to democracy. This trial has significant implications for French politics ahead of elections.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an Australian literary festival is facing turmoil after it canceled an appearance by a Palestinian author. This decision led to roughly 180 writers, including former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, withdrawing from the event. The controversy highlights ongoing debates over free speech and political sensitivities in cultural events.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Recruitment Challenges in Russia</h2>
<p>Reports from Russia reveal troubling recruitment practices involving foreign fighters. An ex-teacher, operating via Telegram, allegedly tricked recruits into joining the conflict under false pretenses, promising they could avoid combat. Several recruits have spoken out about being misled, raising concerns about recruitment ethics and the conditions facing foreign volunteers on the front line.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Tragedy from Around the World</h2>
<p>A poignant story from Mozambique marks the death of Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, who was known as the "miracle baby" born while her mother sheltered in a tree above floodwaters. She died at age 25, reminding us of both human resilience and fragility.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, a tragic landslide at the Binaliw landfill has claimed 11 lives. The disaster struck while more than 100 workers were present, drawing attention to workplace safety and environmental risks in the region.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Investigations</h2>
<p>In the United States, a recent shooting involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis is under investigation. Officials will review video footage and examine policy guidelines to determine whether the shooting was justified. This case may influence law enforcement accountability and community relations.</p>
<p>In sports, Australian footballer Josh Cavallo accused his former club, Adelaide United, of homophobia after alleging he was sidelined because of his sexuality. The club has denied these claims, saying it "categorically rejects" the accusations. The dispute adds to ongoing conversations about inclusion and equality in sports.</p>
<h2>Regional Politics and Upcoming Elections</h2>
<p>Uganda is preparing for elections amidst a demographic reality where most of the population is under 17. The vote will decide whether the current 81-year-old leader secures another term. This situation reflects broader challenges faced by many African nations, where young populations often intersect with long-standing political leadership.</p>
<p>In India, the superstar Vijay, popular among Generation Z, is attempting to make a political impact. Analysts remain cautious about whether his fame will translate into electoral success, illustrating the complex relationship between celebrity and political power.</p>
