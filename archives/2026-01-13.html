    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Tensions and US Policy on Iran</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on various military and covert options regarding Iran amid escalating tensions. Additionally, the US announced a 25% tariff targeting countries that maintain business relationships with Tehran as a means to apply economic pressure. Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister has declared that the country is "ready for war," signaling a serious escalation in rhetoric between the two nations. This development could impact global security and diplomatic efforts in the Middle East going forward.</p>
<h2>Global Central Bank Support for US Fed Chair</h2>
<p>Eleven central banks around the world have expressed solidarity with Jerome Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, after the US government initiated a criminal investigation into the Fed. This united front underscores confidence in Powell’s leadership amid the scrutiny and highlights the importance of maintaining stability in global financial systems. The ongoing investigation's outcome may influence financial markets and central bank policies internationally.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in France and South Korea</h2>
<p>In France, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen has started an appeal against a judicial ruling that bars her from running for public office for five years. Her legal contestation may affect the dynamics of the upcoming French presidential elections if the ban is overturned.</p>
<p>South Korean prosecutors have sought the death penalty for former President Yoon. He faces charges of leading an insurrection related to his attempt to impose martial law in 2024. This marks a significant moment in South Korean legal and political affairs, with possible consequences for national governance and justice.</p>
<h2>Rising US Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
<p>For the first time in three years, the United States has experienced an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. This rise is attributed primarily to cold weather conditions and the growing energy demands of data centers. The development presents challenges for US climate goals and could influence future policies aimed at reducing emissions and combating climate change.</p>
<h2>Security and Violence in West Africa and the Philippines</h2>
<p>In Niger, authorities have revoked the licenses of tanker drivers who refuse to transport fuel to Mali amid a jihadist blockade that has contributed to a worsening fuel shortage. This move aims to counter disruptions caused by militant attacks and maintain essential supply lines in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Philippines, the death toll from a rubbish landslide at the Binaliw landfill has risen to 11. The landslide occurred while over 100 workers were present, highlighting ongoing concerns about occupational safety and disaster preparedness in the country.</p>
<h2>Notable Incidents: Corsica and US Politics</h2>
<p>A search is underway for a gunman after Alain Orsoni, a well-known Corsican separatist figure who had been living in exile in Nicaragua, was shot dead at his mother’s funeral. This event draws attention to ongoing tensions connected to Corsican separatism.</p>
<p>In the US, Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain, is suing Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth over an attempted review of his retirement grade. Kennedy alleges that the move is retaliation for his criticism of the previous administration, raising issues about military retirement rights and political influence within the Department of Defense.</p>
