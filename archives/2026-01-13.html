    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The Iranian regime, described as authoritarian, is not yet at the tipping point where it might collapse suddenly, according to analysis from the BBC's international editor. Opponents of the regime hope increased pressure might accelerate its gradual decline. Meanwhile, the prime minister of Greenland has made a strong statement in favor of maintaining ties with Denmark rather than the United States, responding to renewed U.S. plans to annex the territory. In South Korea, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for former president Yoon, who is accused of leading an insurrection in 2024 by attempting to impose martial law.</p>
<h2>U.S. Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, former President Bill Clinton has refused to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein, claiming the subpoena was not enforceable. Republicans have vowed to hold him in contempt for his absence. Additionally, the Trump administration is moving to end deportation protections for many Somalis legally residing in the U.S. This occurs amidst increased immigration enforcement efforts in Minneapolis, a city with a large Somali community.</p>
<h2>Financial and Economic News</h2>
<p>Eleven major central banks worldwide have expressed solidarity with U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the launch of a criminal investigation into the Fed by U.S. authorities. This joint support highlights the significance of the central bank leadership amid this legal scrutiny.</p>
<h2>International Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Niger has revoked the licenses of tanker drivers who refuse to deliver fuel to Mali. This action follows attacks by jihadist groups targeting tankers, contributing to a worsening fuel shortage in Mali. Additionally, reports reveal that foreign fighters recruited to join Russia’s front line were misled; a former teacher who operated recruitment efforts via Telegram told them they could avoid combat, which was not the case.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The K-pop band BTS is set to launch a major comeback tour, their first since completing mandatory military service in South Korea. The tour is projected to generate up to $1 billion, reflecting the group's ongoing global popularity. On a somber note, Scott Adams, the controversial creator of the Dilbert comic strip, has died at age 68, with his ex-wife announcing his death during a live podcast stream.</p>
