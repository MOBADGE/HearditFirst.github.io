    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>In Iran, the political situation remains tense but is not yet at a tipping point, according to analysis from the BBC’s international editor. The report notes that authoritarian regimes tend to collapse gradually before potentially falling suddenly. Opponents of the Iranian government hope for increased international pressure to speed this process, but the regime has not reached that critical stage yet.</p>
<p>In Denmark’s Arctic territory, the prime minister of Greenland made a strong statement about its political alignment, emphasizing a preference for Denmark over the United States. This comes amid renewed US plans to annex Greenland, originally pushed by former US President Donald Trump. The statement marks a firm stance by Greenland’s leadership on their international partnerships.</p>
<h2>US Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>Former US President Bill Clinton has declined to attend a congressional committee’s hearing investigating Jeffrey Epstein. Clinton’s decision to skip the testimony, citing the subpoena as unenforceable, has led Republicans on the committee to vow to hold him in contempt. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, received support from 11 central banks after a criminal investigation was launched into the Fed. The central banks expressed solidarity with Powell amid the ongoing inquiry.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings in Asia</h2>
<p>In South Korea, prosecutors have sought the death penalty for former president Yoon, who faces accusations of leading an insurrection when attempting to impose martial law in 2024. This marks a significant and rare legal challenge against a former national leader, underscoring ongoing political tensions in the country.</p>
<h2>Immigration and Humanitarian Issues</h2>
<p>The US administration announced plans to end deportation protection for many Somalis living legally in the country, particularly focusing on Minneapolis, where a large Somali community resides. This move is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration. In West Africa, Niger revoked licenses of tanker drivers who refused to deliver fuel to Mali due to a jihadist blockade. The blockade has exacerbated Mali’s ongoing fuel shortages, creating a challenging humanitarian situation.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The K-pop band BTS has announced a major comeback tour, their first since completing mandatory military service in South Korea. The tour is expected to generate approximately $1 billion, highlighting the group's significant global influence and the commercial power of K-pop.</p>
<h2>Notable Death</h2>
<p>Scott Adams, the creator of the controversial Dilbert comic strip, died at the age of 68. His ex-wife announced his passing during a live stream of his podcast. Adams was known for his polarizing views as well as his long-running comic series.</p>
