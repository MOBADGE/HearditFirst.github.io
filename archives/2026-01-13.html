    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Tensions and Security</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on military and covert options regarding Iran, amid escalating tensions. In response, the US also imposed a 25% tariff on countries that "do business" with Tehran. Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister declared that the country is "ready for war", signaling a stark and growing diplomatic confrontation. The development highlights ongoing geopolitical friction in the Middle East, raising concerns about potential conflict and its regional implications.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Recruitment in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Reports from recruits reveal that a former teacher operating through Telegram has been misleading men into joining Russia’s frontline forces in Ukraine. The recruits say they were tricked into thinking they could avoid combat, pointing to troubling recruitment practices. This insight adds a human dimension to the ongoing conflict and raises questions about the treatment and intentions behind foreign recruitment strategies.</p>
<h2>Disaster in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A tragic landslide at the Binaliw landfill in the Philippines has claimed 11 lives. At the time of the incident, over 100 workers were present at the site. This disaster underscores the dangers faced by workers in landfill environments and may prompt calls for improved safety measures and emergency response protocols in such vulnerable settings.</p>
<h2>Investigating a Minneapolis Shooting</h2>
<p>Officials in Minneapolis are investigating a shooting involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The inquiry will focus on video footage and examine whether the officers' actions complied with policy guidelines. Experts say this procedural examination is standard in determining whether the use of force was justified, amid broader public scrutiny of law enforcement practices.</p>
<h2>Sports and Social Issues</h2>
<p>Josh Cavallo, a pioneering footballer open about his sexuality, has accused his former club, Adelaide United, of homophobia, suggesting he was sidelined because of being gay. Adelaide United has "categorically rejected" these claims. This situation brings attention to ongoing challenges related to LGBTQ+ inclusion and discrimination in professional sports.</p>
<h2>Cultural Controversy in Australia</h2>
<p>An Australian literary festival is facing turmoil after canceling an appearance by a Palestinian author. In protest, around 180 writers, including former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, have withdrawn from the event. This controversy sheds light on the complex intersections of culture, politics, and freedom of expression in the arts world.</p>
