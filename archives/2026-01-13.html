    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The ongoing political tension in several regions remains notable today. In Iran, despite hopes from opponents for quicker change, the regime is not on the verge of collapse, according to the BBC's international editor. In Denmark's Arctic territory, Greenland’s Prime Minister has made a clear statement favoring continued ties with Denmark over the United States. This stance comes after US President Donald Trump revived plans to annex Greenland, marking the strongest response from a Greenlandic leader to date.</p>
<p>In South Korea, prosecutors have taken a hard line against former president Yoon, seeking the death penalty over accusations that he led an insurrection in 2024 by trying to impose martial law. Meanwhile, in the US, former president Bill Clinton has refused to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein, citing an unenforceable subpoena. In response, Republican lawmakers have threatened to hold him in contempt of Congress.</p>
<h2>Economy and Finance</h2>
<p>Worldwide financial leaders have expressed solidarity with US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Eleven central banks issued statements backing Powell following the launch of a criminal investigation into the Fed. This support is significant for maintaining confidence in global financial stability amid ongoing scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Immigration and Security</h2>
<p>The US government under the Trump administration has announced plans to end deportation protections for many Somali residents in Minneapolis, a city with a substantial Somali community. This move is part of larger efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>In West Africa, Niger has revoked licenses of tanker drivers who have refused to deliver fuel to Mali. The action comes amid a jihadist blockade, where militants have targeted tankers entering Mali, worsening an already critical fuel shortage.</p>
<h2>Culture and Society</h2>
<p>In entertainment, the K-pop group BTS has announced a major comeback tour, the first since the members completed compulsory military service in South Korea. The tour is expected to generate around $1 billion, highlighting the band's substantial global popularity.</p>
<p>On a different note, Scott Adams, the controversial creator of the Dilbert comic strip, passed away at age 68. His ex-wife announced his death during a live podcast stream, marking the end of a notable career in satire and comic art.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Recruitment</h2>
<p>Reports from Russia reveal troubling recruitment tactics used for foreign fighters. An ex-teacher operating on the Telegram platform reportedly misled recruits by suggesting they could avoid combat, a claim contradicted by accounts from the recruits who ended up on the front lines. This highlights ongoing concerns about recruitment practices in conflict zones.</p>
