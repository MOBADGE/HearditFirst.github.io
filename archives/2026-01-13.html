    <h2>Iran Protests and International Reactions</h2>
<p>A US-based rights group has reported that over 1,850 protesters have been killed in Iran amid a government crackdown on demonstrations. The unrest continues as Iranian citizens protest against the regime, reflecting deep dissatisfaction within the country. The US president has publicly encouraged Iranians to keep demonstrating, stating "help is on its way," signaling a possible intent to increase international pressure on Iran. Observers note that while some authoritarian regimes may collapse suddenly after a gradual decline, Iran's regime is not at that stage yet. Opponents and foreign observers are watching closely, hoping for increased momentum toward significant political change.</p>
<h2>Greenland's Political Stance on US-Denmark Relations</h2>
<p>In a significant statement, Greenland's prime minister expressed a clear preference for Denmark over the US. This comes in the wake of renewed plans by the US president to annex Greenland, which has drawn attention and controversy. Greenland’s decision underscores the territory’s desire to maintain strong ties with Denmark and signals resistance to US attempts to alter its political status.</p>
<h2>Global Central Banks Support US Federal Reserve Chair</h2>
<p>Eleven top central banks worldwide have publicly backed Jerome Powell amid a criminal investigation launched in the US relating to his role as chair of the Federal Reserve. This show of solidarity highlights Powell's standing within the international financial community and points to concerns about the potential implications for global economic stability should the investigation impact his leadership.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings Against Former Leaders</h2>
<p>Two high-profile former leaders are facing legal challenges. In the US, former President Bill Clinton has refused to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein, citing issues with the subpoena’s enforceability. His absence has prompted Republicans to vow contempt charges. Meanwhile, in South Korea, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for ex-President Yoon, accusing him of leading an insurrection by attempting to impose martial law in 2024. These cases reflect ongoing political and legal tensions in both countries.</p>
<h2>US Immigration Policy Impacting Somali Community</h2>
<p>The US government has moved to end deportation protections for many Somalis living legally in the country, particularly targeting the Minneapolis area, which has a large Somali community. This shift is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, and it raises concerns about the potential impact on immigrant communities and their families.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Social News</h2>
<p>South Korean K-pop band BTS announced a major comeback tour, their first since completing compulsory military service. The tour is expected to generate around $1 billion, illustrating the group’s significant global popularity and commercial success. In other news, Scott Adams, the controversial creator of the Dilbert comic strip, has died at age 68. His ex-wife announced the news during a live stream of his podcast, marking the end of an influential and sometimes divisive career in comics and commentary.</p>
