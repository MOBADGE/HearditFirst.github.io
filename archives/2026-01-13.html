    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Relations and Security</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on various military and covert strategies concerning Iran amid rising tensions. In a related move, the US has imposed a 25% tariff on countries that continue to engage economically with Tehran. Iran’s foreign minister responded by stating that the country is "ready for war," signaling a possible escalation in the region. These developments underline the fragile state of international diplomacy involving Iran and the US, with potential implications for global security.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in France</h2>
<p>Marine Le Pen, leader of a far-right party in France, faces an appeal trial that could impact her ability to run for president. Jordan Bardella, the head of her party, cautions that barring her candidacy would be "deeply worrying" for democracy in France. This trial thus holds significant consequences for French politics ahead of upcoming elections, potentially affecting voter choices and party dynamics.</p>
<h2>Conflicts and Recruitment in Russia</h2>
<p>In Russia, reports have emerged about a former teacher who, through the messaging app Telegram, misled foreign recruits into fighting on the front lines. The recruits claim they were tricked into combat, contradicting initial promises that they could avoid direct fighting. This issue sheds light on recruitment practices during conflict and raises questions about the treatment and informed consent of foreign fighters.</p>
<h2>Environmental Concerns in the US</h2>
<p>US greenhouse gas emissions have increased for the first time in three years, primarily due to cold weather and higher energy use at data centers. This trend reverses recent progress in reducing emissions, posing challenges for the country’s climate goals and highlighting the ongoing impact of climate and technological factors on environmental sustainability.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Human Interest Stories</h2>
<p>Two major tragedies occurred recently with significant loss of life. In the Philippines, a landslide at the Binaliw landfill has claimed 11 lives, affecting over 100 workers present at the time. Meanwhile, in Mozambique, Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, known as the "miracle baby" born in a tree during severe floods 25 years ago, has died. Her birth story had symbolized resilience amid natural disaster. These events reflect ongoing concerns about environmental hazards and their human consequences.</p>
<h2>Social Issues and Cultural Events</h2>
<p>Several social and cultural controversies are unfolding. Footballer Josh Cavallo has accused his former club, Adelaide United, of sidelining him due to homophobia, a claim the club denies. In Australia, a literary festival faced turmoil after canceling a Palestinian author, leading to the withdrawal of about 180 writers, including Jacinda Ardern, former Prime Minister of New Zealand. These situations highlight ongoing struggles with inclusion and freedom of expression in sports and the arts.</p>
<h2>Elections and Demographic Challenges</h2>
<p>Uganda is heading to the polls in an election focusing attention on the country’s young population, with most citizens under 17 years old. The vote will decide whether an 81-year-old political figure receives another term, raising issues common to many African countries about age demographics and political representation. The outcome may influence discussions on governance and youth engagement in the region.</p>
