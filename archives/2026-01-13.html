    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The political landscape remains tense in several parts of the world. In Iran, the regime’s opponents hope for increased pressure to hasten political change, but analysts say the country's authoritarian regime has not yet reached a critical tipping point. Meanwhile, Greenland's Prime Minister made a clear statement by choosing to strengthen ties with Denmark instead of the US, responding directly to renewed US plans to annex the territory. In South Korea, prosecutors have requested the death penalty for former President Yoon, who faces accusations related to an attempted insurrection during martial law in 2024.</p>
<h2>US Political and Legal Developments</h2>
<p>In the United States, former President Bill Clinton has refused to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein, arguing that the subpoena was not enforceable. In response, some Republicans have vowed to hold him in contempt. Additionally, the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the US Federal Reserve. However, Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, has received public support from eleven other central bank leaders, who expressed solidarity amidst the investigation.</p>
<h2>Security and Conflict</h2>
<p>Tensions continue in parts of Africa and Eastern Europe. In Niger, authorities have revoked the licenses of tanker drivers who refuse to enter Mali, a country facing a fuel crisis due to a jihadist blockade and attacks on fuel tankers. Meanwhile, reports have emerged of foreign recruits being misled to fight on Russia’s front line. One woman, a former teacher operating through Telegram, allegedly tricked men into joining the conflict under false pretenses that they would avoid combat.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The K-pop band BTS is preparing for a major comeback tour, marking their first since completing compulsory military service in South Korea. The tour is poised to generate revenue of around $1 billion, signaling a significant event for fans and the music industry. In a notable cultural update, Scott Adams, the controversial creator of the "Dilbert" comic strip, has died at the age of 68. His death was announced live during a podcast by his ex-wife.</p>
<h2>Immigration Policy in the US</h2>
<p>The Trump administration has announced plans to end deportation protections for many Somalis living legally in the United States, particularly targeting Minneapolis where there is a large Somali community. This move is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration in the region, and it raises questions about the future status and security of Somali residents in the city.</p>
