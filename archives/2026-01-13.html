    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Tensions Between the US and Iran</h2>
<p>The United States president has been briefed on various military and covert options regarding Iran amid escalating tensions. In addition, the US has imposed a 25% tariff on countries that continue to conduct business with Tehran. Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister has declared that the country is "ready for war." These developments suggest rising hostilities that could impact regional stability. The situation remains fluid, with potential diplomatic and security repercussions depending on how both sides proceed.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in France</h2>
<p>A significant legal trial is underway in France that could affect the future political career of the leader of a far-right party. The trial concerns the possibility of banning her from running for president. Jordan Bardella, the party head, has expressed concern that such a ban would be "deeply worrying" for democracy. The outcome of this appeal trial may influence the political landscape in France and the status of far-right movements there.</p>
<h2>Recruitment Issues on Russia's Front Line</h2>
<p>In Russia, some foreign recruits who joined the fight have come forward saying they were misled by a former teacher operating on the Telegram messaging platform. These recruits claim they were told they could avoid combat roles but have since been placed on the front lines. This revelation highlights challenges in recruitment practices and raises questions about transparency and the conditions faced by foreign fighters.</p>
<h2>Tragic Landslide in the Philippines</h2>
<p>A landslide at the Binaliw landfill in the Philippines has resulted in the deaths of at least 11 people. The incident occurred while more than 100 workers were present at the site, making it a significant workplace tragedy. Rescue and investigation efforts are ongoing to determine the causes and prevent future disasters at landfill locations.</p>
<h2>Controversy and Investigations in Minneapolis</h2>
<p>Authorities are investigating a recent shooting involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis. Experts say the inquiry will focus on video evidence and whether actions complied with official policy guidelines. The investigation aims to clarify the circumstances surrounding the shooting and whether it was justified under law enforcement standards.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Social Issues in Sport and the Arts</h2>
<p>In sports, Josh Cavallo, a pioneering footballer known for being openly gay, has accused his former club Adelaide United of homophobia after claiming he was sidelined due to his sexuality. The club has strongly denied the allegations, rejecting the claims outright. Separately, a literary festival in Australia faced a backlash after removing a Palestinian author from its program. The decision led to about 180 writers withdrawing from the event, including former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, sparking debates about freedom of expression and cultural inclusion.</p>
<h2>Youth and Elections in Uganda and India</h2>
<p>Uganda is preparing for a national election amid demographic challenges, with most of its population under the age of 17. The election draws attention to whether younger voters will support an 81-year-old candidate seeking another term. Similarly, in India, movie star Vijay is leveraging his popularity among Gen Z to embark on a political career. Analysts remain cautious about whether his celebrity status will successfully translate into votes in upcoming elections. These situations illustrate the complex relationship between youth demographics and political shifts in different countries.</p>
