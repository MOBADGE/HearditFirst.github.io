    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>In Iran, the situation remains tense but the authoritarian regime is not yet nearing collapse, according to analysis from the BBC's international editor. Opponents of the regime hope increased pressure will speed up political change, but such shifts often happen gradually before a sudden turning point. Meanwhile, in Denmark’s autonomous territory of Greenland, the Prime Minister made a strong declaration of loyalty to Denmark amidst renewed US plans to annex the island. This marks the firmest stance from Greenland’s leadership on the issue. In South Korea, prosecutors have requested the death penalty for former president Yoon, accusing him of leading an insurrection linked to a failed attempt to impose martial law in 2024.</p>
<h2>United States</h2>
<p>The US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell received public support from the leaders of eleven other central banks after a criminal investigation was launched against him in the United States. This solidarity highlights the international community’s backing amid the probe. Meanwhile, former US president Bill Clinton has become the focus of controversy as he skipped a committee testimony about Jeffrey Epstein. Clinton’s team stated the subpoena was not enforceable, but Republicans have vowed to hold him in contempt over the refusal to testify. Additionally, the US government is moving to end deportation protections for many Somalis living legally in the country, particularly in Minneapolis, amid a broader crackdown on illegal immigration.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In Niger, authorities have revoked licenses of tanker drivers who refuse to enter Mali due to attacks by jihadist groups. These attacks have worsened fuel shortages in Mali, complicating the country’s ongoing security challenges. Separately, the BBC has reported on foreign fighters recruited via Telegram to fight on Russia’s front lines. An ex-teacher who operated the recruitment reportedly misled some recruits, telling them they could avoid actual combat, which raises questions about recruitment practices and the experiences of those involved.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Fans of Korean pop group BTS have reason to celebrate as the band announced an extensive comeback tour, their first since completing compulsory military service in South Korea. This tour is expected to generate around $1 billion in revenue, marking a significant moment for the group and the global music industry. In other cultural news, Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the controversial Dilbert series, passed away at the age of 68. His ex-wife announced his death during a live broadcast of his podcast.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Today's news covers a range of geopolitical developments, ongoing investigations, and cultural milestones. From key political moves in Iran, Greenland, South Korea, and the United States, to security concerns in Niger and Mali, the global landscape remains complex and evolving. The entertainment world witnessed both a notable comeback and a loss, reflecting the continued global interest in cultural figures and events.</p>
