    <div class="date">January 13, 2026</div>
    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>The BBC's international editor reflected on the gradual decline of authoritarian regimes, noting that while many fall suddenly after a slow weakening, Iran is not yet at that point. Opponents of the Iranian regime hope that increasing internal and external pressures might accelerate its eventual demise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Greenland, the Prime Minister made a firm statement in favor of Denmark amid renewed US plans to annex the territory, signaling a clear preference for maintaining ties with Denmark rather than the United States.</p>
<p>In South Korea, prosecutors have requested the death penalty for former president Yoon. He faces allegations of leading an insurrection connected to his attempt to impose martial law in 2024.</p>
<h2>US Political Developments</h2>
<p>Tensions continue in the US as eleven central banks worldwide expressed solidarity with Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, following the launch of a criminal investigation into the US Fed. This support highlights confidence in Powell amid the legal scrutiny.</p>
<p>Former president Bill Clinton is facing opposition from Republicans after he failed to appear before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein. Clinton argued that the subpoena was unenforceable, prompting threats from Republicans to hold him in contempt.</p>
<p>Moreover, the US government is moving to end deportation protections for many Somalis living legally in the country. This comes as part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, particularly in Minneapolis, which has a significant Somali community.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In Mali, jihadist groups have been attacking tankers delivering fuel, exacerbating the country's existing shortage. In response, Niger has revoked the licenses of tanker drivers who refuse to transport fuel to Mali due to security concerns, potentially impacting fuel supplies further.</p>
<p>Additionally, foreign recruits who joined the fight on Russia’s front lines report feeling misled. An ex-teacher operating on Telegram encouraged them to join under false pretenses that they could avoid combat, according to interviews with these recruits.</p>
<h2>Culture and Entertainment</h2>
<p>The K-pop band BTS announced a major comeback tour, their first since completing their mandatory military service in South Korea. The band stands to generate around $1 billion from this extensive tour, highlighting their global popularity and commercial success.</p>
<p>In news from the arts, controversial cartoonist Scott Adams, known for creating Dilbert, died at the age of 68. His ex-wife shared the news during a live stream of his podcast.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These updates highlight developments across politics, security, and culture around the world, with ongoing impacts on governance, international relations, and popular culture.</p>
