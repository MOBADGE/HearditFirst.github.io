    <h2>Tensions Rise Between the US and Iran</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on possible military and covert actions targeting Iran, according to sources. In addition, the US has imposed a 25% tariff on countries that continue to "do business" with Tehran. These moves follow statements from Iran’s foreign minister, who said the country is "ready for war." This escalation highlights rising tensions, which could have significant regional and global implications depending on how diplomatic and military responses unfold.</p>
<h2>Controversy Over Recruitment of Foreign Fighters in Russia</h2>
<p>Reports have emerged of an ex-teacher operating on the messaging app Telegram who reportedly misled foreign recruits about their involvement in Russia’s military conflict. Recruits told the BBC they were tricked into believing they could avoid combat, yet many have ended up on the front lines. This situation raises questions about recruitment practices and misinformation affecting foreign volunteers in the conflict.</p>
<h2>Philippines Landslide Claims 11 Lives</h2>
<p>A deadly landslide at the Binaliw landfill in the Philippines resulted in the deaths of at least 11 people. More than 100 workers were present at the site during the incident. This tragedy draws attention to the safety and regulation of landfill sites and the risks faced by workers in hazardous waste disposal environments. Local authorities and communities will likely face increased pressure to improve safety measures.</p>
<h2>Investigation Underway into Minneapolis ICE Shooting</h2>
<p>Authorities are investigating a recent shooting involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis. Officials plan to review video footage and ICE’s use-of-force policy guidelines to determine whether the shooting was justified. Experts emphasize the importance of thorough analysis in police-involved shootings to maintain public trust and accountability.</p>
<h2>Cultural Boycott After Palestinian Author Removed from Australian Festival</h2>
<p>An Australian literature festival has faced significant backlash after removing a Palestinian author from its program. This decision led about 180 writers, including former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, to withdraw from the event in protest. The incident has sparked debate about freedom of expression, cultural politics, and the role of political considerations in literary events.</p>
<h2>Political Spotlight on Youth and Leadership in Uganda and India</h2>
<p>Uganda is holding an election amid demographic shifts, with most of its population under age 17. Observers note the challenge of whether the country’s 81-year-old leader will gain another term, given the young electorate. Meanwhile, in India, a popular film star named Vijay is attempting to enter politics. He has attracted strong support among Generation Z, but analysts remain uncertain if his celebrity status will translate into electoral success. Both cases highlight the complex relationship between demographics, culture, and political leadership.</p>
