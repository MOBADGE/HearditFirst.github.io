    <h2>International Tensions Over Iran</h2>
<p>The US president has been briefed on military and covert options against Iran amid rising tensions. Additionally, the US has imposed a 25% tariff on countries that engage in business with Tehran. Iran’s foreign minister has responded by saying the country is "ready for war," heightening concerns about potential conflict in the region. This move marks a significant escalation in US-Iran relations and may affect global geopolitical stability.</p>
<h2>Global Financial Leaders Support US Fed Chair</h2>
<p>Eleven central banks worldwide have expressed solidarity with Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve. This support comes after US authorities launched a criminal investigation into the Federal Reserve itself. The backing from major financial institutions underscores confidence in Powell’s leadership amid ongoing scrutiny and legal challenges.</p>
<h2>French Politics and Legal Challenges for Le Pen</h2>
<p>An important appeal trial has opened in France that could influence the political future of Le Pen, leader of a far-right party. Jordan Bardella, who heads the same party, warned that banning Le Pen from running for president would be "deeply worrying" for democracy. The outcome of this trial will have significant implications for France’s upcoming elections and political landscape.</p>
<h2>US Greenhouse Gas Emissions Rise</h2>
<p>For the first time in three years, greenhouse gas emissions in the United States have increased. The rise is attributed mainly to colder weather and increased activity at data centers. This development poses challenges to efforts aimed at reducing emissions and addressing climate change, suggesting that further actions may be needed to meet environmental targets.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Security Issues in Africa and Asia</h2>
<p>In Niger, licenses of tanker drivers refusing to deliver fuel to Mali have been revoked amid attacks by jihadists. This blockade has exacerbated Mali’s ongoing fuel shortages, complicating humanitarian and security efforts in the region.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, a rubbish landslide at the Binaliw landfill has caused at least 11 deaths. Over 100 workers were present when the disaster happened, marking a tragic event that highlights concerns about safety in waste management facilities.</p>
<h2>US Political and Legal News</h2>
<p>US Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain, has filed a lawsuit against Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Kelly is contesting an attempt to review and possibly reduce his retirement grade following his criticism of the previous US administration. This case reflects ongoing tensions in US politics related to military and government personnel decisions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, investigators are examining the Minneapolis police shooting incident, reviewing video footage and policy guidelines. The inquiry aims to clarify key facts and determine accountability in this case, which has attracted significant public and media attention.</p>
