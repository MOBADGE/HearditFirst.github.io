    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Security and Political Developments</h2>
<p>On January 3, explosions were reported in Caracas as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was detained by the United States. The circumstances and implications of this high-profile capture are still unfolding, with significant potential impacts on Venezuela's political stability and US-Venezuelan relations.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, the US president warned that Washington "will come to the rescue" of peaceful protesters in Iran if they are killed during demonstrations. Iran's foreign minister called this warning "reckless," highlighting ongoing tensions and international concerns over the situation in Iran.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Casualties in Ukraine</h2>
<p>A missile attack in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv killed two people, including a child. Russian officials disputed reports that the strike was caused by their forces, suggesting instead that the explosion was due to Ukrainian ammunition. The conflicting claims underscore the continued hostilities and difficulties in verifying events in the conflict zone.</p>
<h2>Regional Stability in the Middle East</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has called for Yemeni factions to participate in a "dialogue" in Riyadh following clashes and an independence bid in southern Yemen. The conflicts involve forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, raising hopes that diplomacy may ease tensions in the war-torn country.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Public Safety</h2>
<p>A fire at a Swiss ski resort resulted in the deaths of four young people—two Swiss women ages 21 and 16, and two Swiss men ages 18 and 16. Their bodies have been returned to their families, marking a tragic event for the local community.</p>
<p>In Mexico, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the southern and central regions on Friday. The disaster killed two people and injured several others, adding to concerns about natural disaster preparedness and response in the region.</p>
<h2>Social and Urban Issues</h2>
<p>In Japan, over 100 visitors to the Mitsumine Shrine were forced to stay overnight due to heavy snowfall closing surrounding roads. This incident highlights how severe weather can disrupt travel and daily life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada's housing market is facing a downturn, especially for micro-condos in its largest cities. These smaller units, once popular as affordable living spaces, are now losing value faster than other types of properties. This shift is prompting questions about changing housing demand and urban planning.</p>
<h2>Conservation and Legacy</h2>
<p>Craig, an elephant known both for his peaceful nature and role in promoting beer brands, has died at the age of 54. Officials praised him as an icon of successful conservation efforts, noting his unique contribution to raising awareness about wildlife protection.</p>
