    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>Venezuela Political Developments</h2>
<p>Donald Trump announced that Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured at a fortified house, marking a significant step in efforts to change Venezuela’s leadership. The move has sparked questions about what the United States will do next. It is uncertain whether Washington will push for elections or attempt to remove other government officials. The situation remains fluid, and the coming days will provide more clarity on the US strategy and the reaction from Maduro’s supporters.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>A missile strike in Kharkiv killed two people, including a child. Ukrainian authorities reported this attack, but Russian officials denied responsibility, claiming the explosion resulted from Ukrainian ammunition. This incident highlights the ongoing tensions and conflicting narratives in the region.</p>
<p>In Yemen, Saudi Arabia has called for factions involved in recent clashes and a southern independence bid to attend a dialogue in Riyadh. The clashes pit Saudi and UAE-backed forces against each other, and the Saudi proposal aims to de-escalate the confrontation and find a political resolution.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Investigations</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have opened a criminal case against managers of a ski resort bar after a deadly fire. Preliminary investigations suggest the fire was caused by sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling. The legal process will examine the management’s role in the incident and seek accountability.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Impact</h2>
<p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 struck southern and central Mexico, resulting in two deaths and multiple injuries. The quake caused significant shaking in the affected areas, raising concerns about structural safety and emergency response efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, heavy snowfall in Japan forced more than 100 visitors to spend the night at the Mitsumine Shrine after roads were blocked. The incident underscores the challenges that severe weather can pose for travel and safety.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>The BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family allowing them to film in their home after an earlier incident where filming occurred without consent following the 2023 Hamas attack. The family had described the initial filming as an intrusion.</p>
<p>Also, Craig, a elephant known as the “beer-ambassador” for promoting lager, has died at the age of 54. Officials praised Craig as an icon of conservation success and noted his peaceful nature.</p>
