    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>Latin America Developments</h2>
<p>Donald Trump reported that Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured at a heavily fortified home. The details of their detention remain limited. In the wake of this event, questions arise about the next steps for the United States. It is uncertain whether the US will push for new elections in the country or attempt to remove additional government officials. These developments could significantly impact the region’s stability and political future.</p>
<h2>Middle East Tensions</h2>
<p>Tensions continue in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia called on Yemeni factions to participate in a dialogue in Riyadh. This invitation follows recent clashes and a push for independence in southern Yemen, which have intensified conflicts involving Saudi and UAE-backed forces. Meanwhile, the US President’s warning to Iran regarding protests—stating Washington would intervene if peaceful protesters are harmed—has been criticized by Iran’s foreign minister as reckless.</p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict Update</h2>
<p>A missile strike on Kharkiv reportedly killed two people, including a child, according to local authorities. Russia disputes these claims, suggesting that an explosion was caused by Ukrainian ammunition, denying responsibility for the missile attack. The situation remains tense and contested, highlighting ongoing violence in the region.</p>
<h2>Public Safety and Tragedy</h2>
<p>In Switzerland, a criminal case has been opened against managers of a ski resort bar following a deadly fire. Initial investigations indicate that the likely cause was sparklers on champagne bottles being held too close to the ceiling. This case emphasizes concerns about safety regulations and accountability in public venues.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Humanitarian Impact</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico, killing two people and injuring several others. The earthquake caused significant shaking, raising concerns about the vulnerability of the affected communities and the potential need for emergency response and support.</p>
<h2>Other News</h2>
<p>More than 100 people were forced to spend the night at Japan’s Mitsumine Shrine due to heavy snowfall and road closures. In a different story, the BBC reached an agreement with an Israeli family over filming in their home without consent, relating to the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas attack. Lastly, Craig, an elephant known as a beer ambassador and symbol of conservation, passed away at age 54, marking the loss of a much-loved animal figure.</p>
