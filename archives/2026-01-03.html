    <h2>Venezuela: US Military Operation Captures Maduro</h2>
<p>An elite US military mission known as "Operation Absolute Resolve" successfully breached Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s fortified compound and captured him. This marks a significant development in US-Venezuelan relations. The US has intensified pressure on Maduro since January 2025, but the exact next steps remain uncertain. Analysts highlight questions over whether the US will push for new elections or attempt to remove additional government officials. The situation remains fluid as the region watches closely.</p>
<h2>Yemen: Saudi Arabia Calls for Dialogue Amid Rising Tensions</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has invited Yemeni factions to participate in a dialogue in Riyadh following recent clashes in southern Yemen. The clashes involve Saudi and UAE-backed forces amid a push for independence by local groups, escalating tensions. The call for dialogue aims to de-escalate conflict and encourage political solutions, though the path forward remains challenging due to competing interests in the region.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters: Earthquake in Mexico and Heavy Snow in Japan</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico on Friday, resulting in two deaths and injuries to several others. Emergency responders continue to assess damage and provide aid to affected communities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Japan, heavy snowfall forced over 100 visitors to spend the night at the Mitsumine Shrine after surrounding roads were closed. The incident highlights ongoing winter weather challenges in the region and the importance of preparedness during extreme conditions.</p>
<h2>Investigations and Legal Actions: Swiss Fire Incident and BBC Agreement in Israel</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have opened a criminal case against managers of a ski resort bar after a deadly fire. Preliminary investigations suggest sparklers on champagne bottles, held too close to the ceiling, likely caused the blaze. The case will examine possible negligence and safety failures.</p>
<p>Separately, the BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family whose home was filmed without consent following the 7 October Hamas attack in 2023. The family described the incident as an “intrusion,” and the agreement marks an effort to address their concerns about privacy and media conduct.</p>
<h2>In Brief: Elephant Conservation and Ongoing Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Craig, the elephant known as a “beer ambassador” and a symbol of successful conservation efforts, has died at age 54. Officials commemorate his peaceful nature and contributions to wildlife awareness.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, a missile attack on Kharkiv reportedly killed two people including a child. Russian officials dispute the reports, attributing the explosion to Ukrainian ammunition instead. This incident occurs amid ongoing conflict and highlights continuing tensions in the region.</p>
