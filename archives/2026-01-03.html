    <h2>Venezuela and US Relations</h2>
<p>Donald Trump has announced the capture of Nicolás Maduro, describing it as an operation from “a house that was more like a fortress.” The US move to remove Maduro and his wife from power in Venezuela raises many questions about next steps. It is unclear if Washington will push for new elections or try to depose more government members. The situation is seen as risky and unpredictable, with potential wide-ranging impacts for Venezuela’s political future.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security Updates</h2>
<p>A missile attack in Kharkiv reportedly killed two people, including a child, but Russian officials deny the attack, claiming the explosion was caused by Ukrainian ammunition. Meanwhile, in Iran, protests have drawn a sharp response from the US president, who warned Washington would “come to their rescue” if peaceful protesters are harmed. Iran’s foreign minister called this warning “reckless,” highlighting heightened tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Legal and Safety Issues in Switzerland</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have opened a criminal case against managers of a ski resort bar after a deadly fire. A preliminary investigation indicates the fire likely started when sparklers on champagne bottles were carried too close to the ceiling. This tragic accident has prompted legal scrutiny over safety practices at the venue.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico, killing two people and injuring several others. This event has raised concerns about earthquake preparedness and response in affected areas. Additionally, heavy snowfall in Japan forced over 100 visitors to spend the night in a shrine after roads were blocked, highlighting ongoing travel disruptions caused by severe winter weather.</p>
<h2>Middle East Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has called on factions in Yemen to participate in a “dialogue” in Riyadh. The appeal follows clashes and a separatist push in southern Yemen, where forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have come into conflict. The dialogue effort is a key diplomatic attempt to stabilize the region and reduce fighting.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Conservation</h2>
<p>In a lighter note, Craig the elephant, known as a beer ambassador and symbol of conservation success, died at age 54. Officials remembered Craig as a peaceful figure who helped raise awareness about wildlife preservation through his unique role promoting lager.</p>
