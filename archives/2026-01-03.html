    <h2>Disaster in Swiss Ski Resort</h2>
<p>Authorities in Switzerland have identified the first four victims of a recent fire at a ski resort. The victims include two Swiss women, aged 21 and 16, and two Swiss men, aged 18 and 16. Their bodies have been returned to their families. Meanwhile, families remain desperate for information as many teenagers, some as young as 15, are reported missing and thought to have been present at the bar where the fire began. The incident has caused significant distress in the local community, and search efforts continue.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Protests</h2>
<p>In international news, tensions continue over protests in Iran. The US president issued a warning suggesting that Washington would come to the rescue of peaceful protesters if they are killed. Iran’s foreign minister described this warning as "reckless," highlighting ongoing diplomatic strain. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, a missile attack on the city of Kharkiv reportedly killed two people, including a child. Russian officials denied responsibility for the strike, suggesting instead that the explosion was caused by Ukrainian ammunition. This conflicting account adds to the uncertainty in the ongoing conflict region.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Weather</h2>
<p>Natural disasters have also affected parts of the world recently. In Mexico, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central regions, resulting in two deaths and several injuries. Emergency responders continue to assess damage and provide aid to those affected. Meanwhile, heavy snowfall in Japan forced more than 100 visitors to spend the night at the Mitsumine Shrine after local roads were shut, highlighting the impact of severe winter weather on daily life.</p>
<h2>Political Developments in the Middle East</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has called for Yemeni factions to attend a dialogue in Riyadh following recent clashes and a declaration of independence by groups in southern Yemen. This call comes as forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have confronted each other due to ongoing instability in the region. The dialogue aims to address the tensions and restore some measure of stability.</p>
<h2>Urban Housing and Culture</h2>
<p>In Canada, the real estate market in major cities is experiencing a historic decline, with micro-condos—very small residential units—losing their value faster than other property types. This trend reflects changing attitudes toward urban living spaces. In cultural news from India, 2025 saw a dominance of violent, male-driven films in Bollywood, influencing box-office trends and public conversations about cinema and society.</p>
<h2>Challenges in New York City Leadership</h2>
<p>Looking at local governance, New York City Mayor Mamdani faces several challenges as he works to fulfill his campaign promises on the high cost of living. As a Democratic socialist, his leadership will be closely watched to see how he manages the city's economic pressures and addresses residents' needs. The coming months will be critical in evaluating his ability to deliver on these expectations.</p>
