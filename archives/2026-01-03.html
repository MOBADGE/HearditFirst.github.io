    <h2>Tragedy and Uncertainty After Ski Resort Fire</h2>
<p>Families remain desperate for news about teenagers missing following a fire at a ski resort bar. Some of the missing are as young as 15. Authorities have not yet provided detailed information about the cause or the number of people affected. The incident has left many relatives in distress as they await updates on their loved ones.</p>
<h2>Renewed Conflict and Dialogue Efforts in Yemen</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has called on Yemeni factions to participate in a dialogue in Riyadh amid ongoing violence. This appeal follows clashes and a southern independence bid that have intensified confrontations involving Saudi- and UAE-backed forces. The talks aim to address the recent escalation and seek a political solution to the conflict.</p>
<h2>Violence Continues in Ukraine Conflict</h2>
<p>A missile strike in Kharkiv killed two people, including a child, according to local authorities. Russian officials disputed the reports, alleging the explosion resulted from Ukrainian ammunition rather than a missile attack. The incident underscores ongoing hostilities and conflicting narratives in the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters Strike Mexico and Denver</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake shook southern and central Mexico, killing two people and injuring several others. The quake caused significant concern across the affected regions, with emergency services responding to the aftermath.</p>
<p>Separately, more than 100 firefighters responded to a large blaze in Denver. While the cause of the fire remains under investigation, there have been no reported injuries so far.</p>
<h2>Political and Economic Challenges in North America</h2>
<p>New York City’s mayor, Mamdani, faces significant challenges as he seeks to fulfill his cost-of-living promises following his election as a Democratic socialist. Analysts are watching closely to see how he will address these economic pressures impacting city residents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada is experiencing a sharp decline in its condo market, particularly for micro-condos. Once popular small units are now losing value faster than other types of housing, marking a historic downturn in major Canadian cities’ real estate sectors.</p>
