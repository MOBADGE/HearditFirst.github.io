    <h2>International Conflicts and Protests</h2>
<p>Tensions remain high in several parts of the world. In Kharkiv, Ukraine, a missile attack reportedly killed two people, including a child. Ukrainian authorities said the strike caused the casualties, while Russian officials denied these reports, suggesting that the explosion was due to Ukrainian ammunition. Meanwhile, in Iran, the US president warned that Washington would intervene if peaceful protesters are harmed. Iran’s foreign minister called this warning “reckless,” highlighting the delicate nature of foreign involvement in the country’s protests.</p>
<h2>Middle East Developments</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has invited Yemeni factions to a dialogue in Riyadh amid recent clashes and an independence bid in southern Yemen. These events have led to confrontations between Saudi and UAE-backed forces. The call for dialogue aims to ease tensions and address the ongoing conflict affecting the region’s stability.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico on Friday, resulting in two deaths and several injuries. The strong shaking caused damage in multiple areas, underscoring the continuing vulnerability of the region to seismic activity and the need for preparedness and response efforts.</p>
<h2>Domestic Incidents</h2>
<p>In the United States, over 100 firefighters responded to a blaze in Denver. No injuries were reported, and officials are investigating the cause of the fire. The incident highlights the ongoing challenges of urban fire safety and emergency response capacity.</p>
<h2>Missing Teens and Community Concerns</h2>
<p>Families remain desperate for news about teenagers who are missing following a fire at a ski resort bar. Some of the missing are as young as 15 years old, and relatives are appealing for any information to locate their loved ones. This situation underscores the tragic human impact of the incident and the community’s urgent need for answers.</p>
<h2>Urban Housing and Politics</h2>
<p>In Canada, the real estate market is facing a historic downturn, particularly affecting micro-condos in major cities. These smaller housing units are losing value faster than larger homes, reflecting changing preferences and economic pressures on urban living.</p>
<p>In New York City, Mayor Mamdani faces significant challenges as he works to fulfill cost-of-living promises that helped secure his election. Addressing these issues will be critical for his administration and the city’s future.</p>
