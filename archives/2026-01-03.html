    <h2>International Relations and Conflict</h2>
<p>Tensions continue in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The US president warned that Washington "will come to the rescue" if peaceful protesters in Iran are killed, a statement described as "reckless" by Iran’s foreign minister. This exchange highlights ongoing concerns over the situation in Iran and how external involvement might escalate tensions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Ukraine, a missile attack struck Kharkiv, killing two people including a child. Ukrainian authorities attribute the strike to Russia, but Russian officials deny the report, suggesting the explosion was caused by Ukrainian ammunition. This incident underscores the continued conflict and disputed narratives in the region.</p>
<h2>Middle East Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has called for Yemeni factions to participate in a dialogue in Riyadh. This invitation follows recent clashes and an independence bid in southern Yemen that escalated confrontations between Saudi-backed and UAE-backed forces. The talks aim to address the growing instability and promote peace efforts in Yemen.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake hit southern and central Mexico, resulting in two deaths and several injuries. The powerful quake caused widespread shaking on Friday, raising concerns about ongoing safety and recovery efforts in the affected areas.</p>
<h2>Urban Challenges in the US</h2>
<p>New York City’s mayor Mamdani faces significant challenges as he works to fulfill promises related to the high cost of living. The mayor, identified as a Democratic socialist, must address key issues affecting residents amid economic pressures. His ability to deliver on these big promises will be closely watched in coming months.</p>
<h2>Emergency Response in Denver</h2>
<p>Over 100 firefighters responded to a large blaze in Denver. Fortunately, no injuries have been reported, and the cause of the fire remains under investigation. Emergency crews continue efforts to fully contain the fire and assess damage.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These stories highlight ongoing conflicts, diplomatic efforts, natural disasters, and urban leadership challenges around the world, reflecting a complex global landscape as 2026 begins.</p>
