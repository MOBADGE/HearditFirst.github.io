    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>Latin America and US-Venezuela Relations</h2>
<p>Former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured at a heavily fortified residence, according to Donald Trump. The circumstances and implications of their capture remain unclear as discussions unfold about the next steps. The US faces complex decisions on whether to push for elections in Venezuela or to aim for the removal of additional government members. This development signals continued US involvement in Venezuelan affairs and raises questions about regional stability and diplomatic strategies going forward.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Conflict and Tensions</h2>
<p>A missile attack in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has killed two people, including a child, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russian officials dispute the attack's origin, claiming the explosion resulted from Ukrainian ammunition. The incident underscores the persistent volatility in the region and illustrates the ongoing conflict’s toll on civilians.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has called for Yemeni factions to participate in dialogue in Riyadh. This appeal follows recent clashes and an attempted independence bid in southern Yemen, leading to confrontations among Saudi- and UAE-backed forces. The Saudi initiative aims to foster discussions that could ease tensions, although the situation remains fragile.</p>
<h2>Legal Action After Swiss Ski Resort Fire</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the managers of a ski resort bar following a deadly fire. Preliminary findings suggest that sparklers on champagne bottles, brought too close to the ceiling, were likely the cause. This case highlights concerns about safety protocols at public venues and may lead to changes in regulations or enforcement to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<h2>US-Iran Relations Amid Protests</h2>
<p>Tensions between the US and Iran have risen after Donald Trump warned that Washington would intervene if peaceful protesters in Iran are killed. Iran’s foreign minister described this warning as "reckless," reflecting the already strained relations between the two countries. The situation spotlights the delicate dynamics surrounding domestic protests and international responses.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters Impact Communities</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico, killing two people and injuring several others. The quake caused significant shaking across the region, reflecting the ongoing risk of seismic activity in Mexico.</p>
<p>In Japan, more than 100 visitors took shelter overnight at Mitsumine Shrine due to heavy snowfall that blocked roads. This event demonstrates the impact of severe weather conditions on communities and infrastructure, especially in mountainous areas.</p>
<h2>Cultural and Conservation News</h2>
<p>Craig, an elephant known for promoting beer and symbolizing successful conservation efforts, died at the age of 54. Officials remember him as a gentle ambassador for wildlife preservation, marking the end of a notable chapter in animal conservation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family regarding filming in their home without consent following the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023. The family described the earlier filming as an intrusion, and the agreement marks a resolution after public concerns about privacy and respect emerged.</p>
