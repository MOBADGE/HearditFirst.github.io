    <h2>Venezuela Operation and Political Implications</h2>
<p>The United States conducted a high-risk mission called "Operation Absolute Resolve" to capture Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by breaching the fortified compound where he was held. The operation involved elite troops and advanced technology including drones and surveillance. This dramatic event marks a significant escalation in US efforts against Maduro, following heightened pressure since the start of the Trump administration. Analysts are now debating what the US will do next—whether to promote elections in Venezuela or attempt to remove additional government officials remains uncertain.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Diplomacy in Yemen</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has called for Yemeni factions to participate in a dialogue in Riyadh as clashes continue in southern Yemen. This follows a push for independence in that region, which has led to confrontations involving Saudi and UAE-backed forces. The call for talks aims to defuse tensions and foster political discussions amid ongoing unrest.</p>
<h2>Tragic Incidents in Europe and Latin America</h2>
<p>A criminal case has been opened in Switzerland against managers of a ski resort bar following a deadly fire. Preliminary investigations indicate that the fire likely started when sparklers on champagne bottles were raised too close to the ceiling, igniting a blaze. Meanwhile, in Mexico, a 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck southern and central regions, resulting in two deaths and multiple injuries. Emergency crews are continuing to respond and assess damage from the strong quake.</p>
<h2>Humanitarian and Weather Impacts in Japan</h2>
<p>More than 100 people were forced to spend the night in Mitsumine Shrine in Japan after heavy snowfall shut off surrounding roads. Visitors to the shrine sought refuge to wait out the winter storm, highlighting the ongoing challenges posed by extreme weather in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>The BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family for filming inside their home without prior consent after the family survived a Hamas attack in 2023. The family described the incident as an “intrusion.” Separately, Craig, a 54-year-old elephant known for promoting peace and beer, has died. Officials praised Craig as a symbol of successful conservation efforts. In Ukraine, a missile attack on Kharkiv reportedly killed two people including a child. Russian officials disputed the missile strike claims, suggesting instead the explosion resulted from Ukrainian ammunition.</p>
