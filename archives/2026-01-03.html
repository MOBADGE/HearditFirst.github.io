    <h2>Venezuela Crisis</h2>
<p>The United States has captured Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, with former U.S. President Donald Trump stating that the U.S. would "run" Venezuela until a "safe" transition could take place. The situation remains complex and uncertain, as questions arise about the next steps. It is unclear whether the U.S. will push for new elections or attempt to remove additional members of the Venezuelan government. This development marks a significant turning point in Venezuela’s ongoing political crisis and could have wide-reaching regional implications.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Political Unrest</h2>
<p>A missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine, killed two people, including a child. Ukrainian authorities stated this was due to a missile strike, while Russian officials disputed this claim, suggesting the explosion came from Ukrainian ammunition. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has called for Yemeni factions to attend a dialogue in Riyadh following recent clashes and an independence bid in southern Yemen. The clashes have involved Saudi- and UAE-backed forces, highlighting continuing tensions in the region.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Accidents</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake in southern and central Mexico resulted in two deaths and several injuries. The powerful quake caused significant shaking across the area on Friday. In Switzerland, criminal investigations have been opened against managers of a ski resort bar after a deadly fire. Preliminary findings suggest the fire was likely caused by sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, leading to tragic consequences.</p>
<h2>Protests and International Reactions</h2>
<p>Iran is experiencing ongoing protests, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned that Washington "will come to their rescue" if peaceful protesters are killed. Iran’s foreign minister called this warning "reckless," underscoring tensions between the two countries. These protests and responses continue to draw international attention, raising concerns about potential escalations.</p>
<h2>Human Interest and Culture</h2>
<p>Over 100 visitors were forced to shelter overnight at Japan’s Mitsumine Shrine due to heavy snowfall that shut off surrounding roads. In a different story, Craig, an elephant known as a beer ambassador and conservation icon, died at age 54. Officials praised Craig for his peaceful nature and his role in raising awareness for wildlife conservation.</p>
<h2>Media and Ethics</h2>
<p>The BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family who survived a Hamas attack in 2023 after the family said the broadcaster filmed in their home without consent. The family described the incident as an “intrusion,” prompting the BBC to address the situation through this agreement. This case highlights ongoing challenges in media ethics and the rights of individuals affected by conflict.</p>
