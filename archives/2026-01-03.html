    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>
    <div class="date">January 03, 2026</div>
    <h2>International Affairs</h2>
<p>On January 3, US forces detained Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro in Caracas amid explosions in the capital city. Details about the operation are still emerging, but the event marks a significant development in Venezuelan and US relations. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has called for Yemeni factions to participate in a dialogue in Riyadh after clashes and a push for independence in southern Yemen heightened tensions among Saudi- and UAE-backed groups. These diplomatic efforts come amid ongoing conflict in the region.</p>
<h2>Conflicts and Security</h2>
<p>Fighting continues to affect civilians in Ukraine and Iran. A missile strike in Kharkiv reportedly killed two people, including a child, although Russian officials deny the attack and blame Ukrainian ammunition for the explosion. Meanwhile, US warnings to Iran regarding protests have been criticized by Iran’s foreign minister, who called the statements reckless. The US president had pledged to intervene if peaceful protesters were harmed, a stance that has raised tensions.</p>
<h2>Disasters and Emergencies</h2>
<p>A fire at a Swiss ski resort has led to multiple casualties, with authorities identifying the first four victims: two Swiss women, aged 21 and 16, and two Swiss men, aged 18 and 16. Families of other missing teenagers have expressed distress and are urgently seeking information about their children believed to have been at the location during the fire. Additionally, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico, killing two people and injuring several others. In Japan, more than 100 visitors were forced to spend the night at Mitsumine Shrine after heavy snow closed surrounding roads.</p>
<h2>Environment and Conservation</h2>
<p>Craig, an elephant known as a beer ambassador and symbol of successful conservation, has died at age 54. Officials remembered the pachyderm as a peaceful animal that helped promote both wildlife conservation and cultural causes.</p>
<h2>Economy and Housing</h2>
<p>Canada’s housing market is experiencing a historic downturn, particularly affecting micro-condos in major cities. Smaller units are losing value faster than larger properties, raising questions about changing urban housing preferences and economic trends in the country’s real estate market.</p>
