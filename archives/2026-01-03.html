    <h1>Heard It First – Daily Digest</h1>

    <h2>Latin America and US Relations</h2>
<p>On January 3, Donald Trump said he and his team took Nicolás Maduro and his wife from "a house that was more like a fortress." This marks a significant development in US involvement in Venezuela, but what comes next remains uncertain. Questions are being raised about US intentions—whether the focus will shift to pushing for elections or removing more government officials in Venezuela. This situation could affect the country's political future and US foreign policy.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Diplomacy in the Middle East</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has called for Yemeni factions to participate in a dialogue in Riyadh. This invitation follows recent clashes and an independence bid in southern Yemen, which has led to confrontations between Saudi and UAE-backed forces. The call for talks aims to ease tensions and possibly bring a resolution to ongoing conflicts in Yemen.</p>
<p>In related news, the US president issued a warning about protests in Iran, saying Washington "will come to their rescue" if peaceful protesters are killed. Iran's foreign minister described this statement as "reckless," highlighting ongoing tensions between the two countries.</p>
<h2>Security and Safety Incidents</h2>
<p>A missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv reportedly killed two people, including a child. Ukrainian authorities have blamed Russian forces for the attack. However, Russian officials have denied this, suggesting the explosion was caused by Ukrainian ammunition. The contrasting accounts underscore the ongoing conflict and challenges in verifying information on the ground.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, authorities have opened a criminal investigation against managers of a ski resort bar after a deadly fire. A preliminary probe found that the likely cause was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling. This case highlights concerns about safety regulations and accountability.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters and Human Impact</h2>
<p>A powerful magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico, killing two people and injuring several others. The earthquake caused significant shaking in the region, posing challenges for rescue and recovery efforts.</p>
<p>In Japan, over 100 visitors were forced to shelter overnight at Mitsumine Shrine due to heavy snowfall that shut off nearby roads. The event shows how severe weather can rapidly disrupt travel and daily life.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Craig, a famous elephant known as a beer-ambassador and symbol of conservation success, has died at the age of 54. Officials remembered Craig as a peaceful and important figure in wildlife conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Separately, the BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family regarding filming in their home after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. The family described the earlier filming without consent as an "intrusion," and the new agreement aims to address those concerns.</p>
