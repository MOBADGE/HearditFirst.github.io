    <h2>Venezuela: US Captures President Maduro</h2>
<p>In a highly unusual and secretive operation called "Operation Absolute Resolve," US forces successfully captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by breaching his heavily fortified compound. This mission marks a significant escalation in US-Venezuela relations. The US had been increasing pressure on Maduro since January 2025, aiming to remove him from power. Experts suggest the move carries considerable risks, and it remains unclear whether the US will now push for democratic elections in Venezuela or seek to depose other government officials.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Dialogue in Yemen</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has invited various Yemeni factions to a dialogue in Riyadh following recent clashes and an independence bid in southern Yemen. These events have intensified tensions between Saudi-backed and UAE-backed forces operating in the country. The proposed talks are an attempt to ease these confrontations and stabilize the region, though further details on who will attend or when the dialogue will take place have not been released.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters: Earthquake in Mexico and Snow in Japan</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico on Friday, killing two people and injuring others. Authorities are continuing rescue and recovery efforts in the affected areas. Meanwhile, in Japan, more than 100 visitors to Mitsumine Shrine were forced to spend the night at the location after heavy snowfall blocked surrounding roads. Emergency services responded promptly to ensure the safety of those stranded.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fire in Swiss Ski Resort Bar</h2>
<p>Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the management of a ski resort bar after a deadly fire occurred there. Preliminary findings indicate the fire was likely caused by sparklers on champagne bottles being held too close to the ceiling. The investigation aims to clarify responsibilities and prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Tensions in Ukraine</h2>
<p>A missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has resulted in two deaths, including that of a child. Ukrainian officials have reported the attack, but Russian authorities disputed the claims, suggesting the explosion was caused by Ukrainian ammunition instead. This incident adds to the ongoing conflict and uncertainty in the region.</p>
<h2>Other Notable News</h2>
<p>Craig, an elephant known as a "beer ambassador" and symbol of successful conservation, has died at the age of 54. Officials remember him as a peaceful animal and an icon in wildlife preservation. Additionally, the BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family over filming inside their home without consent after the Hamas attack in October 2023. The family described this as an intrusion, and the agreement seeks to address their concerns.</p>
