    <h2>Middle East Tensions and US-Iran Relations</h2>
<p>The US president recently stated that Washington "will come to the rescue" if peaceful protesters in Iran are killed. This comment has drawn criticism from Iran’s foreign minister, who described the warning as "reckless." The remark adds tension amid ongoing protests in Iran, highlighting the delicate nature of US-Iran relations. What happens next may affect diplomatic engagements and stability in the region.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Conflict in Ukraine</h2>
<p>A missile strike on Ukraine’s city of Kharkiv reportedly killed two people, including a child, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russian officials deny responsibility, suggesting the explosion resulted from Ukrainian ammunition. This incident underscores the continued violence and conflicting accounts in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, raising concerns about civilian safety and the broader humanitarian impact.</p>
<h2>Earthquake in Mexico</h2>
<p>A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico, killing two people and injuring several others. The powerful natural disaster has affected communities in the region, though the full extent of damage is still being assessed. Recovery efforts are likely to be a priority in the coming days as officials respond to the impact on residents.</p>
<h2>Yemen Conflict and Diplomatic Efforts</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia has called on Yemeni factions to participate in a "dialogue" in Riyadh. This invitation comes amid clashes and an independence bid in southern Yemen, which have heightened tensions between Saudi and UAE-backed forces. The dialogue aims to address the disputes and promote stability in Yemen, a country facing complex internal divisions and external influences.</p>
<h2>Challenges Facing New York City’s Mayor Mamdani</h2>
