    <h2>Global Politics</h2>
<p>Tensions are rising with renewed attention on Iran following a strong statement from Donald Trump, who warned Iran’s authorities against using lethal force on peaceful protesters. Trump said Washington "will come to their rescue," an intervention pledge that Iran’s foreign minister called “reckless.” This exchange highlights ongoing international concern over the protests in Iran and raises questions about possible foreign involvement and escalating diplomatic strain.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has called on the warring factions in Yemen to join a “dialogue” in Riyadh aimed at reducing hostilities. This invitation comes amid recent clashes and a southern independence bid that have pitted Saudi- and UAE-backed forces against each other, complicating efforts toward peace in the region. The success of the dialogue could influence Yemen’s future stability and regional geopolitics.</p>
<h2>Conflict and Security</h2>
<p>In eastern Ukraine, a missile attack on the city of Kharkiv reportedly killed two individuals, including a child, according to Ukrainian authorities. However, Russian officials have disputed these claims, suggesting that the explosion was caused by Ukrainian ammunition. This incident adds to the ongoing conflict concerns in the area and reflects the continued contest over information and control in the region.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>A strong magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck southern and central Mexico, resulting in two deaths and injuring several others. The quake caused significant shaking across a wide area, affecting communities already vulnerable to natural disasters. Rescue and recovery efforts are likely continuing as authorities assess damage and provide aid.</p>
<h2>Urban Governance</h2>
<p>New York City’s Mayor Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who rose to prominence with promises to tackle the high cost of living, faces several critical challenges. These include delivering on affordable housing initiatives, economic relief for residents, and other social policy commitments made during the campaign. How the mayor addresses these issues will be key to maintaining public support and managing the city’s complex needs in the coming months.</p>
